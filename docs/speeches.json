  "A common plan of structure might only mean that idea which best expressed the outcome of a wide study of structure; but to those who tried to peer behind the scenes it meant not seldom to fathom the creation of the world; and it required no vivid imagination to add that it gives an insight into the plan by which the world was created.",

  "It is not until solid matter rises from the crystalline to the higher condition of the colloid, that it becomes capable of absorption, diffusion, and even of assimilation; that, in a word, it assumes relations to the external world which show that it possesses an individuality higher than the cyrstal, and is, in fact, endowed with many of the activities belonging to those masses of colloidal matter which biologists have agreed to call living.",

  "6. The contraction of the earth's interior by cooling and by the emission of material from below the over-crust has caused this crust to press downward, and therefore laterally, and so to effect great bends, folds, and plications; and these, modified subsequently by surface denudation, constitute mountain-chains and continental plateaus.",

  "Curious are the changes which a quarter of a century, produces in the political horizon.",
  "Every condition of exemption has vanished.",
  "So we are brought back to the beginning of this discussion; and, examining philosophically this phase of the complex question of the office of the microbe in society, we are able to answer Broca's question, quoted at first, \"What will take place in future generations when they shall have exhausted the temporary resources of emigration?\" We say: Then the microbe will intervene, as it does periodically; it will decimate populations and will sow death; but it will be to renew life by enabling new existences to take the place of those which have become extinct, and by furnishing them, under an assimilable form, the organic matter which they will require for their life and healthy growth.",
  "Bonney has well shown, in lectures delivered at the London Institution, that an amount of contraction almost inappreciable in comparison with the diameter of the earth would be sufficient; and that, as the greatest mountain-chains are less than one six-hundredth of the earth's radius in height, they would, on an artificial globe a foot in diameter, be no more important than the slight inequalities that might result from the paper gores overlapping each other at the edges.",

  "He strenuously objected that he had never intended to refer the entire process of evolution to natural selection, and later in life affirmed that he had perhaps laid too little stress on the influence of the environment.",
  "One would have thought the record of the Liberal party in connection with Woman Suffrage would have chastened the ardour of those organs of Liberalism which are opposing this Bill in the interests of \"true female suffrage\"; but the gift of perspective is rare in politics, and a strict desire for accuracy an inconvenient failing when there are party ends to serve.",
