What the hell is that?!!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What is that noise?
You!
It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. We’re getting a second opinion.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
Now, how will they know if you’re ready?
Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Good-bye! Good luck!
Hi! Wish me luck!
Oh, good luck.
Good luck. And I’m still right!
That is sooo not true!
What?
She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.
I can check that for ya.
I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, what’s that about?
And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
These are not.
I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Yeah.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
How many guesses do you get?
Six.
Challenge extended.
Deal!
Challenge excepted.
All right, we’ll start with…apples.
We’ll be starting with apples.
Stop that now!
Yes!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Diet soda.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Orange juice.
No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!
Ha-ha!
They have another guess.
Okay, well, we won that one.
Okay, the last thing…
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
I got it! Scotch… tape.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.
Aww, man!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Serious?
Are you scared?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.
Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
No, I’m sorry.
Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
I know! Why don’t you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Huh.
I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.
