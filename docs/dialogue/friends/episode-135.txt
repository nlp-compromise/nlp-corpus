Hi, you guys.
Hey!
Hi!
What’s the matter?
Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
I’ll give up my ticket.
Me too.
Okay that’s so generous!
And I think Ross is generous too.
Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
Great.
Yeah.
So what-what is the exhibit.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh man!
Hey!
Hi!
Hey!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh that’s great!
Yeah.
I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Ross.
Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.
Really? That okay, that’s great.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yes it does.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!
Hey! So I’m back.
The Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.
The  Show me in the table.
Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.
The Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
Oh, I love museums!
Umm.
Soakin’ up all the culture.
Yeah.
Where do you want to start?
Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah!
Hey, and then lunch.
Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
What?! No! Why?!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
The Museum Official:
I didn’t know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!
The Museum Official: May I help you?
Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
The Museum Official: Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.
Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I’m gonna do it too!
Me too!
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
Oh Pheebs.
Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
Phoebe, that stuff is…
Don’t even get me started on yours!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
The I did.
All right, let’s get me back up there!
The No! It don’t go up on the wall!
What—But you saw the show!
The Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?
The Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
The That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.
The I’ve never seen it!
Oh you should, it’s great.
This place is really beautiful!
Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
Sure!
Are you okay? What’s wrong?
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for ya…
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
I’ll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
Do you know where the store is?
No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
I’ll be back in ten minutes.
Okay.
Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.
Yeah we are.
The Museum Official:
Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!
It’s so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we’re the only two people in the world.
What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don’t have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. I’ll be right back.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are you doing here?!
I came with Paul!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Paul:
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke.
Op, ice. I need ice.
Okay.
Thank you.
I’ll be right back.
You and your ice.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!
Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.
I’m so happy that you’re here.
Here I am!
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth’s here! Who are you talking to?
Uh, you guys?
How did you know we were here?
Umm…
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y’know go in that room and do your homework?
Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s bedroom.
That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. That’s your dad’s bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Hi, honey.What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!The Museum Official: Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
The Museum Official: I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available…
Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Female Clerk: Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?
Female Clerk: He’s not here right now.
Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Female Clerk: Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
Paul:
So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
Paul:
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Rachel said that!
Well Rachel’s not here!
Oh! Here it is!
I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
The  Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
The You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
The He went out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!
The That’s my wife!!! Get out!
Well, we should go.
Yeah.
Ross? Ross?
Elizabeth! I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?
Okay!
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
Ross!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Daddy!
You’re next!!
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…
No, let me explain! Fired!!
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
What?
And I too am just a love machine.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?
Right here!
Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…
I know! I know.
Okay.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah, it’s beautiful.
I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Hey Gunther.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.
Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
