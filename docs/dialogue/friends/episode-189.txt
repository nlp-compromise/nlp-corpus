Hello?
I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Honey, you're screaming.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day  ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean...  Monica clean.
Awesome.
Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy,  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt,  the funniest guy I have ever met.
This is nice.
I know!
You need both hands for that?
Yeah, I kinda do.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early  for us to be... having that conversation.
Is it?
Maybe not, is it?
Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this  way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet  someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have  this... Ooh, five bucks...  I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Oh, sorry.
Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the  five dollars.
It's to my apartment.
Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for  Phoebe and Mike.
Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have  to give me your key just because...
Oh no, I want to.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never  meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
Is this cool, huh?
It really is.
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,  but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance  to know her.
That's great, great. So do you have any questions  for us?
Not really.
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Thank you.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Oh, you know, wait. I do have  one question. Do you guys do random drug  testing?
Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm  gonna need three days notice.
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider  the uhm... the first one we met with.
What, the blonde with no bra?
She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree  in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three  years.
Okay...
Hi... I'm Sandy.
And she's a little mannish...
Oh my God! David!
Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW,  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to  explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that  we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Who cares, it got you here.
Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got  on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your  address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Wow. Where is your luggage?
Damn it!
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you  just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression,  uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that  means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually,  no, I look pretty good.
Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see  someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and  you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful,  but... well, you are.
No...
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Oh, well... That had been your window.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking,  I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's  here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Really? The scientist guy?
Really? Chandler?
Continue...
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him  that I would see him tomorrow night.
Phoebe!
I know! Evil! And... and... and...  I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
What are you gonna do?
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that  nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated  moral situation, no right, no wrong...
You have to tell David!
Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation  with Joey.Heeeeeey!
Hey!
Hey!
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they  call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma  having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from  the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Was your cabin  pressurised?
And don't get  me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Okay.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two  words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,  I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried  chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
No, it just remind me of something this guy did today  at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Yeah, he came up...
Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Were you there?
No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave  your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your  heart...
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Are you gay?
Ross!
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I  am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
Oh!
Her name is Deliah.
Oh, that's pretty.
So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people,  but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is  take care of a child.
Okay.
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three  weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...  When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good  reason we shouldn't try him out.
Because, it's weird!
Why?
What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's  like if a woman wanted to be...
Yes?
King?
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made  lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that  rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
YES! Sandy you're hired.
That's great! I'm  sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new  family...
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
You gotta be at least bi...
Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica  is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering  lines.
Well, thank God your  livelihood doesn't depend on it.
I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy  she's ever met.
Seriously? She actually said that?
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Yeah!
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Ye....
Hi! There you are.
Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Oof...
In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.
Oh, wait, wait!
Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that.  I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well,  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
Oh... oh...
Yeah, I should have told you.
No... well, yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well,  are you happy with this guy?
I am happy.
Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want  you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares,  leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I  should probably uhm... go...
Well... but David, just... I just want you to know  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things  I've ever had to do.
Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly  a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss  on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
No... no...
I mean...
In Minsk...
Yeah?
...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm...  and one on the lips.
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...
Hi...
Is everything allright?
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was  just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc√©e and it was just  sooo beautiful.
Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the  poem...
I can't... I can't hear it again.
You know, I can't tell it again...
And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see  you for a sec?
Yeah!
Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three  times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive,  that's all.What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
These are amazing!
Sandy made Madeleines.
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What  kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even...  butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say...  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.  You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in  from branding cattle.
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and  good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
No, no. No.
But... ergo...
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,  we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with  Mike and I really care about him...
Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul...  ui...
Well... hey, the key works...!
And you thanks for the  face massage. Thank you.
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Yeah! I think that's great!
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites  poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Oh... How are they?Hey!
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Really...? Guys do that...? That's...  weird...
Thank you!
That's like a woman wanting to be a...
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler  that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Yeah, so?
Wow!
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...?  Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing...  You know, like Ross's thing is...
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
...No...
I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.  'Cause he's feeling like...
Hey!
Heeeyy! Hey!
What are you guys talking about?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do  draw the line at a male wetnurse.
Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would  have brought more pizza.
Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
What is so funny about that?
Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say  it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Did you tell her what we talked about?
Yeah....
So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with  Geoffrey.
Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean,  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...  and... and limericks...
I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named  Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on,  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the  girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Yep! That's my thing...
So... how many guys have your key?
No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts  not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Did you uhm...
No, no...
...kiss him?
Oh, well, yeah...
Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes  you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.
Don't point your finger at me.
Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about  it...
Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!  Here David, you  should just go.
Allright... But... if I ever do come back  from Minsk... well, you just better watch out.
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd  better watch out.
Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Well, I might.
Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just  lovely there.
Okay, well... guys?
Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
Hey, what are you kidding me?
Right-o, right-o...
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your  key back, I totally understand.
It's never gonna happen again right?
Right! Never! Never! I swear!
I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever  come to Minsk, that's my number
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught  me Hot-cross Buns.
Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...Who's up for puppets?
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants  to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed  to appreciate puppets?
Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours  help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Oh my God!
Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...
That was kind of rude!
Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps  for me.
You know, he was just doing his job...
Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one  who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I  can't go through with this.
Oh, come on Ross...
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force  you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Oh... That's true.
Thank you!
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're  gonna have to do it.
So you see Wigglemunch, that's  why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
I am learning so much from you.
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend  has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey  told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep  it smart, people!
Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
I love you too.
Allright. See you later!
See ya!
Did that guy really make that joke?
Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing  so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Here goes...
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid  it's not working out.
Oh...
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...  with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
YOU! You feel!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.  I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers  from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Oh, damn you Geller!
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever  is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem?  Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's  uhm... my issue.
What is it...?
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with  a guy who's as sensitive as you.
That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think  that is?
Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
hmmm...
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was  kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Huh ha ha!
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get  the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
That must have been hard.
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom...  playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father  walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things?  What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like  a... like a real boy?
But you are a real boy!
I know I am! ...And when it's  summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos  out.
Here come some more...
And what's the one kind of boat that can never,  ever sink?
What kind?
A friend-ship...
Wow! You blow my mind...
Oh, I gotta go.
Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Twenty bucks.
It's like the cheapest college ever.
