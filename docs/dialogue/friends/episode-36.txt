I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there. ROSS: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Just one cheek.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
That's romantic.  C'mon touch it. ROSS: No.  Oh, come on squeeze it. ROSS: No.  Rub it. ROSS: No.  Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.  ROSS: Sorry.  Ah, so what are we looking at? ROSS: Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.  Really?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.  Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time. JOEY: Cool.
