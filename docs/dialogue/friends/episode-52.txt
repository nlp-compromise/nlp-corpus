So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Who’s singing?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
I was always Joanne.
Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!
Booo!!
Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
Matress King: ‘Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I’m so depressed I’m going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I’m going medieval on prices!
What a wank!
Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I’m appalled for you by the way.
Matress King: I’m close. I’m cheap. I’m the king.
‘Okay.
We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.
Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.
Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
I’ll go.
Fine.
Thank you.
Hi Gunther.
Yeah, we’ll see!
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
Guess what?
What?
I got a gig!
Yay!!
See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.
Yeah, I can’t say croissant. Oh my God!
What’s the part?
Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Come on! That’s great.
Wow!
Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
I know!
Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Woo!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’
Ooooh, nice.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh, yay!
Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
Okay.
Sign here.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Is that a problem?
No.
Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on.
Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.
Ahh!
Hey now!
Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, great.
Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.
Okay.
‘Kay, put your head back.
All right. I can’t see.
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Gotcha.
Hi Daddy!
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
You remember Ross.
Um-hmm.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
So! How’s the library?
Ugh, museum.
What happened to the library?
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Yeah, if you’re really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
It’s not a library...
So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Okay.
Okay!
Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Yeah. That’s Daddy.
That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.
So?
So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.
You really serve people sneezers?
Well um, I don’t.
Dr Green: You kids ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
All right.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Oh, ah, you don’t need that.
Why not?
The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
I know.
Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?
Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What’s the part?
Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Um. yeah.
I am soo dead.
All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, okay, okay. I’ll get the bagels.
What’s this?
Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
This is not the bed I ordered!
I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!
Phoebe!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...
When did I sign for it?
When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!
Did you make brownies today?
Knock, knock.
Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.
Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
It’s Monica’s bed. What?
Okay. It’s a racecar.
So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.
Whoa. That was really good.
Thanks, any suggestions?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.
Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.
Hi Daddy.
Baby. Ross.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair. What’d ya do? Swim here?
Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.
What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go.
What?!
Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
Ross? What’s with the neck?
He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’t get into medical school in Extapa!
Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Uh.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Well that’s his last name.
And his first name.
He’s Bobby Bobby?
It’s Robert Bobby.
Oh.
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
What do you need help for?
With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh God!
Argue with that.
What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Come on! You’re just titling! Her legs are fine!
I know that!
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
I’m sorry, let her?
What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!
No.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
I’d love some juice. Thanks.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.
Excellent!
Thank you.
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king.
Hey! You can’t go back there!
Oh my God.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.
