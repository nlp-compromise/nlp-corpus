Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!
How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!
Yeah you are baby.
Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Why’d you say no?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?
Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.
Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Seriously, proud of you.
Yeah.
The I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
You think we’re being obvious?
No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
The  Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Can I get you anything?
The Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.
And I’ll have all the muffins.
Hey!
Shhh! We’re not talking.
Oh. Finally! Oh.
The So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you’re particularly proud of?
All you want is a dingle,  What you envy's a schwang,  A thing through which you can tinkle,  Or play with, or simply let hang...
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. This works with any milk carton.
Now, I can have milk everyday.
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Nice work my friend.
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…
Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.
I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
And a bagel with only…
I was just being polite!
The Okay, how about when you’re not working. What do you do in your spare time?
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
I think you’re right.
All right, ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
That’s kinda nice.
Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.
Yeah.
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah.
FREE PORN!!!
Yeah!!
We have free porn here!!!
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids.
The A mento…
Right.
The Like the candy?
Matter of fact, I do.
The Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Yeah!
Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
What’s wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!
No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Damn you 15s!
It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
Are you kidding?
What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That’s still in there?!
Not anymore.
Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.
Your muffins.
I’ll take those to go. For the kids.
The Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.
The Understood. So, what’d you say back then?
Well, I said that I…
You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…
gal pal Rachel Green.
Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
The Umm, I’m gonna just go get this warmed up.
Okay.
Joey! You’re doing great!
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Mento?
No thanks.
The  So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
The Oh! I like that. What’s your name?
Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
The How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in ‘Ello there mate!
The Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
Yeah, you too.
You too!
Thanks.
Bye.
The So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
How come you have two?  Well this one's for you. Joey: Get out.  No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.  That's what they'll call us.
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I’ve never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
Ohhh.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ewwww!!
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...
Phoebe, Ross, and  Ewwww!!
That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
The So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
The Now, off the record, you’re not…
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
I think face to face.
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.
All right.
Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
You’re turning into a woman.
No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!
Great nap.
It really was.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
The So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin’?
Hey! How you doin’?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.
Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister.
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh my God, introduce us!
This is Chandler.
Hi!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi Jill.
And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey.
Hey, how you doin’?
Don’t!!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
I'm okay.
What?!?! Oh dear God!
Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
The So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh great! Great! Thank you.
The Bye.
Bye-bye. I did it!
Yeah!
Amazing! Amazing!
The  Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what’s your favorite soap opera?
Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?
The Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
Oh, good to know. So close!
Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
You slept with her didn’t you?
Little bit, yeah.
Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Did you just wink at me?
Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.
