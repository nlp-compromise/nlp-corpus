gesundheit
I would love to go out with you.

So he hasn't called?
would you call this girl?  thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing

well you not what you should feel terrible about,  this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you  know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
We are a rare breed.
what a great dinner.
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that  last piece of cake at the restaurant.
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get  you anything?

Oh my god, I've gone out with this girl  before yeah we had sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we  didn't do it hear which is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.
AWCH! That's why.
Hey Mike sorry  to just drop by like this, can I come in?
Sure who are you?
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Oh.
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join  a cult are you?
No
oh it's just you have that look
Damn super cuts!
what's up is Phoebe ok?
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot  look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
that's why she was weird.
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,  a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the  phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with  you stranger from the coffee house.
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four  other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you  said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship  I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
but you did say it
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about  to say Vis-ï¿½-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship  since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Vicrum?
WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
who am I kidding pay-per-view  porn.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB!
is everything all right?
everything's great, just watching some regular  television there, what a pleasant surprise.
I'm gonna go freshen up ok
Ok honey. that was close.
Hello
Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room  and I caught him molesting himself.
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know  guys do that.
yea well the weird part is... he was getting off  to a shark attack show!
Nooooooooo!
Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he  was doing?
do you know how many times I've seen him jump up  like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird  about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone.  not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,  they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who  wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that  he unfroze from a block of ice.
Eww are you talking about my bother.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Hey
Hi
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night  and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in  New York and now you're just going around again.
well that's not even the weird part. I don't think  she remembered sleeping with me.
But you don't remember sleeping with her.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am  very memorable, you guys know.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
and who's fault is that.
what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe  you were having an off night
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes  when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN  MOST!
Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her  out again.
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember  who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again  and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!
Joey, Joey.
What?
you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
No. wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
It's open.
Hey!
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there  to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended  up telling him that.
WHAT!
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with  a guy named Vicrum.
WHAT! WHY?
well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in  a serious relationship.
If you hadn't just had a baby  with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your  danglers RIGHT NOW!
well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know  a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,  No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Good yeah just be honest with him.
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't  been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a  real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will  and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll  be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
I'll get it
ok
Uh huh yeah Vicrum just called.
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,  a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was  the youngest.
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
What?
How could you not remember that we slept together?
What! When?
I dunno!
I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it  was here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
no it's not ringing any bells.
my god woman! How many people do you have to had been  with not to remember any of this?
Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember  me Hey! I still got it. I'll let myself out.
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time  you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate  might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You  know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
I just think there's somebody better out there for  you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Oh.
and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with  me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just  think I can make you happy.
ok I can't do this.
what's wrong?
well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because  I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with  a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. You kissed me.
uh huh
so you don't think I'm a total freak
No. well look can I think your weird and also cool  for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Definitely
This is Vicrum.
Hi honey I'm home!
Hi, how was your flight?
oh it was great.
Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable  because I. have  a little surprise for you.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because  it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Ok
Honey why am I watching  a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast  forward to something a little toothier.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie  that's all.
Oh well this is the only one they had at our video  store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always  have to be sharks?
does what always have to be sharks.
Honey look we can do something else, do you want  me to get into the tub and thrash.
What's going on?
sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a  part of this.
let ME be a part of this!
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks  turn you on!
no they don't
then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF  a treat.
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,  I was just watching regular porn
really?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American  action.
I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
You are an amazing wife. No really  you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you  find the strength and understanding over something like that.
Im very, very drunk right now.
see ordinarily I would talk  to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with  her?
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your  whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious  relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you  go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience  never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with  her.
