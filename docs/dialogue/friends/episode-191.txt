This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy  in the cat condo is Jinkies.
Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?
Chandler Bing.
Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?
What's up Joe?
Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to  be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
Courtside?� Oh my God.
Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with  his knee.
That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.
Hello?
Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and  me tomorrow night.
Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.�  If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right  in fr. . . � That's not the way to convince you.
Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You  can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just  realize it on your own . . .
I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to  figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him  that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that  what little time we have is precious.
Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.
Wow!� � Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That  dress . . . uh . . .�
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like  this.� You, you clean up good.
Oh well, well thank you.�
Oh right, right.� � So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night  away from Emma?
Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank  you for watching the baby, by the way.
Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Phoebe's Mike?
Yeah.
I didn't know you guys hung out.
We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know,  maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be  awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.�  He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some  experience in that area.
Yeah.
Hi
Hey.
Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.
Ok.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,  but if you need anything Ross . . .
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.
Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� Bye.
Bye.
So . . .� Welcome.
I got beer.
I got bottled breast milk.
Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
Okay.� � So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Yeah.
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Ah?� � Do you have one here?
No.
Okay.�
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe  said you . . . You've been divorced?
Yeah.� � Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to  talk about it.MIKE:� So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Yeah.
My cousin's a paleontologist.
Ah?� � Well, he and I would probably have  a lot to talk about.
Hi.
Hey.
Welcome home.
� Oh well, look at you.
Yeah.� What do you think?
Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the  same thing underneath.� So . . .
Oh.
See what I mean . . .
Hey!� How come the door's locked?
Just a second.
No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
Why not?
Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks  game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
So, you lied to him?
Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.�  � Except with you.
Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?�
What are you . ..� � Why are you dressed  like that?
Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple  of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know,  like, "Hi, How do I look?"� "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more  turned on?"
Okay.� �  Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Because. . .� one of them is for you.
Cheers.�
You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction  myself.� � Hi ya.
You might want to keep practicing.
Yah.
It's Joey.� � Hey Joe.
Dude, come home!
What? Why?
COME . . .� HOME.
Look I, I can't.� What's going on?
I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin'  on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
All right look.� � If you can't come home and  deal with this, then I'm gonna.
NO!
I just heard him!
Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
All right, I'm going in.
No! Wait!
I heard him again!
All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm  coming home.
Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in  the hall in case the dude comes out.
Is that really necessary?
Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I  know how to keep my women satisfied.
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes  or less.� Well, how long has it been?
� And now twelve.�  So, do you like the beer?
I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.
huh.� � What's the difference between beer and lager?
I don't know.� We could look it up.
Things are about to get wild.
Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around  talking about you and Ross?
Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.
I know.� �� So, what's going on with you and Ross?
Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But  you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah  . . . little thing.
Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?
Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we  had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Eye-contact?
Mm-hmm.
I hope you were using protection.
� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two  gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Oh.� Should we send them something back?
Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.
No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think  they can come over here.
So?� What if they do?
Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a  b. . . baby and a Ross.
Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We're just having fun.�  You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating  on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� � I heard it.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait  for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got  back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy  in here.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� �  I heard it.
I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Scary pigeon's back?
It's huge.
Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother  lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells  like chicken?� Looks like a potato.
"Spuds" is your grandmother?
That's my bubby!
So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get  your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen  with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.
All right. It's no big deal.
So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But  um. . .
Then, can I have your number?
Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma  are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.
What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to  Ross about it?
No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.� "Hey  Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
� "Me too."
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about  it.""Well, should we just continue to live together and not  really tell each other how we're really feeling?"Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Oh, thanks.
But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Wha. . . hey!
Better!
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments  with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.
Really?� You're moving on from Ross?
I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?
Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.�  Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get  my number back.� � Oh my God.�  He's gone.
Dead on.
Ya know, I'm going to take off.
So soon?
Well, yeah.
Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
Ah, you mean lager.
Ah yeah.� Good times.
Oh.
Hello?
Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen,  is um, is Ross near you?
Uh, no.� I just left.
Well, you have to go back in.
Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?
I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,  um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all  his calls.
I can't do that!
He says he can't do that.
Oh give me , , ,� � Hi, Mike?� Hi.�  Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I .  . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
All right. � Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry  about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
All right.� I'll do it.� �  But really, how much dirtier can it get?
Oh, Mike.� Bye.
Hey buddy.
Uh, hi.
Um, can I come back in?I, I was just thinking about how much more we  have to talk about.
But you left.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three  hour flight.
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Chandler!� You're home!
That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.
What are you saying?
Joey said that you're in here with another man.
There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.�
All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend  take a look around, huh?� � Bwa-ah-ah!
What is he doing?
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
� Why do I smell men's cologne?
I think that's you.
� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
There's nobody here Joe.
I guess not.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.� You  own me an apology.
Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.
Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could  happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.
Whoa,  whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how  did your suitcase beat you here?
I climb down the fire escape and you  can't put that in the closet?
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the  same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
I'll get it.� � It's for you.
I don't understand what just happened  here.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend  the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be  with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."�
Joey?
Yeah?�
I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.
Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to  you?
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know  you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a  bump on the head.
I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with  Monica.
All right.
You can go.
What?
You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.
Really?� You're gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the  art of seduction.
You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
It's gonna be so hot!�
Okay, bye.
Have fun.
Thanks.� � Here's your ticket.
Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want  you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Thanks man.
Where are you going?
Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Hi.
Oh God.�
Oh . . .
I'm so glad you're back.�
Oh.
Wow.� So, what did you guys do?
Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries  of normal social conduct.
It's true.� I did.
Well, good bye.
That was fun Pheebs.
I know.� That was fun.�
See you guys.�
Rachel, lock the door.� Lock the door,� seriously.
Oh shoot.� I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.� � Wait, wait.� Sorry.� Did he call?�  Did that guy call?
No.� Just his mom.
Oh, around 8:30?
Yeah.
Then, again at 9:00?
uh-huh.
Yeah.
Hello.� � Okay, "Bill from the bar."�  I'll make sure she gets your number.
Aaah.�
So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have  a good time?
Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.
Uh, Rach.
Yeah?
� Never  mind.
Hey you guys.�
Hey.
Hey.� I'll be right back.� I've got to go to the bathroom.�
Stout.� That's a kind of beer.
