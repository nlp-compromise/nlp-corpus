ROSS: Oh my God, you look so good!  I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.  Because I promised Mindy I would. MONICA: Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.  Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about? MINDY: Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.  Insane! MINDY: ...from the syphilis.  What?! BARRY: Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
ROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes . JOEY: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
