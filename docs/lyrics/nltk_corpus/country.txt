I couldn't help but overhear you talking to yourself
How she slipped right through your hands
And in between all of the four letter words
You said your never gonna understand
You gave her everything you thought she ever wanted
Now all you want is gone
Your Just One of Many Broken Hearted
Wondering what went wrong
Welcome to the club
Don't be thinking you're the only one
Who's heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howling at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club
Over in the corner is ol' Larry John
Getting over wife number two
And sitting next to him is a regular here
They're as lonely as me and you
We got one thing in common
When we walked in
A memory we're trying to kill
Swearing up and down we'll never try again
But we know we will
Welcome to the club (x3)
Swingin' doors
Neon lights
Hardwood floors
It's Saturday night
Got on my dancing boots
I've got a cold Lonestar
I've got a two steppin' mind
And a honky tonk heart 
I've got a two steppin' mind And a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
It's happy hour when I get there
Pretty girls, man they're everywhere
There ain't no way to keep us apart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
Hey, I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
Some people say I'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked
Sometimes I feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book
All the places I've played and the money I've made still I've got nothing to show
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
You put your whole life into somethin' you love and you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage
But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
Oh, is you
I've lead a lifetime fightin' this land
Workin' for nothin' with these dry, callused hands
I'm a slave to the sun, It ain't cuttin' me no slack
Gets me beggin' whenever I look back
Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been
Three generations countin' on me
To work this farm keep it in the family
Well, I've done all I can and it's past becomin' clear
That I can't hold out much longer here
Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been
Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been
Ain't no angels where I've been
People ask me what you doin' son
You're gonna drive yourself insane
You'll never find the sunshine
When you're followin' the rain
Seems like I'd take a new road
After all these years
But I wind up on the same old trail of tears
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin'into you
I hate the way I loved you
But my mind keeps goin' back
My train of thought just won't get off
That same old worn out track
It's an every night occasion me and your memory meet
On that endless lonely street of broken dreams
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Here she comes now
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
Lord, I'm walkin'
Down Memory Lane
Oh, I'm walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin' walkin')
Down Memory Lane
It was raining hard in Houston, when I ran into her
I searched for conversation, but I was lost for words
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashing down on me
If it hadn't been for the pouring rain, I'm sure she would have seen
Tears in the rain, hiding the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
Now I regret that moment, 'cause I didn't let her know
How much I still loved her, I was hoping it would show
But the rain drops and the tear drops ran together on my face
Now she'll never ever know, no one can take her place
Tears in the rain, hiding the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
She thinks I'm so strong, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car
I guess she took for granted
I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time
But it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
She said I've given you my best
But I can't take no more
She said I've run out of reasons
Then she walked out the door
It's gonna take a lot of doin'
To get over her goodbye
'Cause it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
You've got a glow that's not a suntan
And a new gleam in your eyes
Oh it must have been one great vacation
Girl you look so satisfied
Tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
You said you needed a small vacation
Just a couple of days all by yourself
So off you went in a new direction
And what you found was someone else
So tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
What room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
Tell me what room was the holiday
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in
It looks a little weathered, so it looks good on me
But since you've left I'm wearin' this old hat differently
Pain, wind, rain and sun, it keeps out all but one
So I keep the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops come around
So nobody else can see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But baby I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat
Last night, I thought I'd go out I don't know where my head was at
I had to turn around go back and get my hat
And I was glad I did when I saw you with him
I kept the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops came around
So nobody else could see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But baby I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat
Now mamma I know you've always wished me the best,
And I've found somebody and I think she's gunna pass the test.
She's a country girl as far as I can see,
Mamma I hope she's what you had in mind for me.
She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this.
Now mamma I know she didn't grow up on a farm,
But she sure knows her way around out behind the barn,
And it ain't exactly chores she does at dawn,
But she says she's gunna love me till the cows come home.
She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this.
She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this,
Yeah mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this...
Bartender I may sit here on this barstool all night long
But I won't need much attention
I just need some time alone
So if you'll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best
You can just sit back and let the jukebox do the rest 
Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue" while I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
Let's start off nice and easy
Something like "If I Know Me"
And we'll work our way up slowly to "Fool Hearted Memory"
Yeah I've got all night long to sit right here and fall apart
So don't leave out one single song
I know 'em all by broken heart
Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue"
While I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
There ain't one country singer
That ain't good for a bad heartache
And for me there's nothing smoother
Than a good stiff shot of Strait
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
Without me
Maybe you'd find somebody else
A little wiser with a lot more wealth
And without you it's true I'd be free
To go chasing all of my dreams without any strings
But I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to
At the end of everyday
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Hard times
May never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have
Will barely be enough
And babe you know, how cold the wind can blow
Love has never let us down
When we needed it the most
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way (x2)
Any other way, oh girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way, oh
Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pick-up trucks
Got old Hank crankin way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down
There's a big fire burnin but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Ed's been on the tractor ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen 'em headed down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughter's just pulled up in a Jeep
Man he knows how to grow 'em if you know what I mean
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
You can have a lotta fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
You can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know:
Don't mess with the bull 'cause he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay outta the beans
If it starts to rain then we'll just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
You can have a lotta fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Let's get down y'all
Stay outta that hay
I was standing, at the end of my rainbow
With nowhere to go, and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes, were just way too much to hope for
But when I saw you, I knew I'd seen the light
And not a moment too soon, without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour, with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
I used to think, that love would never find me
And the one who cares, was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me, I knew I'd found forever
You rescued me, just before I crossed the line
And not a moment too soon, without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour, with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Oh-oh yeah
Not a moment too soon, yeah

So proud to live
So proud to die
Last Monday morning, you left with no warning
I started going insane. Well, I headed south out of Del Rio, Texas
With a hell of a load on my brain. I kept on going
Without even knowing, how much your love really means
Now I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams
This picture ain't pretty
I'm ragged and dirty
And wondering what I'm doing here
Shooting tequila, wantin' to kill ya
And wishin to God you were near
So full of your memory
But feeling so empty
I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams
Oh, I'm stuck here in Mexico, living on refried dreams.
Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind
And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl
Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm
And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl
Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees
And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old
Well it's been a rainin' on and on
Ever since you've been gone
Those dark clouds keep a rollin' in
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight
The bottom falls out again
Well I can barely keep afloat
I'm up the creek without a boat
And I've been a driftin' heaven knows how long
'Cause it's been rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Hey well drip, drip, drip
Goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any board in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time
Since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Listen to me now
I keep staring out the window
Searching for a rainbow
To signal that the storm will end
Hey, 'Cause I know that the rain will keep pourin' on the pane
Until my saint comes back marchin' in
Oh, girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Hey well drip, drip, drip
Goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any board in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
But baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Yeah, it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
I popped the clutch on that old red Ford 
Her daddy would holler and run to the door 
Dust would fly as we flew down that old gravel driveway 
And lookin' back I can't believe he let her run with a boy like me 
He said "You better get her back by ten or there'll be hell to pay" 
I can still feel her lips on mine 
It's all so real but lost in time 
Ain't that just like a dream 
Runnin' wild and runnin' free 
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 
Saturday nights we could all be found 
Radios up and our windows rolled down 
Hearts on fire and holdin' hands sights set on forever 
We never thought those days would end we'd never be the same again 
Summer would be the last time we would ever be together 
I never knew I'd wake up some day 
In a brand new world so far away 
Ain't that just like a dream 
Runnin' wild and runnin' free 
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 
Ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends
I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation
Ain't asking very much
I hate comin' home to this old broken down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all
But I ain't got enough
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps tellin' me that everything is gettin' better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder
Just wanna break even
Someday before I die
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life
All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life
Every where I go,
They're starin' at her,
Every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man.
I look the other way
They're hittin' on her every night and day
They telephone her
They try and get to her
But I know they can't
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart.
She walks into the room
And everybody watches every move
Hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
They hang around.
But they don't realize
There's more to her than what meets eye
That's why I'm certain
That no matter what they do
To reach her now
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart.
She never lets it go to her heart
(Repeat chorus until fades)
Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind-it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So, she can't be really gone
The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waiting in the hall
For her to slip them on
So, she can't be really gone
I don't know when she'll come back
She must intend to come back
I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need
Just look around the room
So much of her remains
Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now, who could ever walk away
At chapter twenty-one
So, she can't be really gone
Just look around the room
So much of her remains
Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now, who could ever walk away
With so much left undone
So, she can't be really gone
No, she can't be really gone
I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled up
It got a whole lot emptier as I watched them fill that truck
And when they carried out your clothes it took my breath away
Now they're headed for that bed
The thought keeps runnin' though my head
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
I'll pay them boys to stop right now
And leave that truck out on the curb
The TV and the phone's packed up
So we won't be disturbed
There's not a light left in this room
Just a shadow of a doubt
So let's make sure we don't give up
Before we've thought this through enough
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, baby, maybe, baby, maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight
Fogged in in Dallas
On my way to L.A.
Staring up at the screen,
All flights were delayed.
When a voice from behind me
Asked "Stranger how have you been?"
Well I was caught off guard,
When I saw her face
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace
Then somehow I managed to say
"Good to see you again."
We caught up on old friends,
Caught up on old times
But all through the small talk,
It kept burnin through my mind
Does she think about the nights we spent on Crystal Lake?
Wrapped up in a blanket till the break of day
So many times I've wondered
Does she, think of me that way?
I didn't ask
And she didn't say
Tradin stories and pictures of kids
Things we're gonna do and things we never did
Till stranded in that moment
Not sure what to say
Then she broke the silence
With her little shy smile
She brought up the weather,
But all the while I wondered
If she thinks about Jackson Hole
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way?
I didn't ask and she didn't say
We said our goodbyes
Swore we'd stay in touch
Then we went our separate ways
Knowing no one ever does
But I couldn't help but wonder
As I walked away
If things had turned out different
Where would we be today
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way?
I didn't ask and she didn't say
No I didn't ask and she didn't say
Maybe I go too fast, too far
Let's get it straight now the way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
I could be your wildest dream
I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
And I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade
I get this feeling that I should be gone
But something keeps telling me to take you alone
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in and and take a chance on me
Don't even think about settlin' down
Ain't gonna hang my hat in no one town
I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I gotta wash my truck
And dress up
Pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me
And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Hey! Don't forget to turn out the lights!
She was reading a book that she'd already read just to pass the time
He just sat there and stared at the TV set like he was barely alive
When the local news was over they would climb the stairs
Crawl in bed underneath the covers like neither one was there
And it's a long long way across the Great Divide
The songs that they once sang now echo far and wide
They could still get back all the love that they have lost
But only if they both will reach across
'Cause it's a long long way to the other side of the Great Divide
He was up in the attic on the Fourth of July as they flew a flag in the yard
When he found some roses she had long ago dried before they drifted apart
How the years had slipped right by them he didn't understand
He carried a petal into the kitchen and he placed it in her hand
Your eyes say that you've been hurt before
And you can't take the heartache anymore
You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby, this is me you're talking to
You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man
I know you think that love will never last
And you see your future like the past
You don't wanna make the same mistake
You think that I'm one more to make
But baby, I'm not him for goodness sake
You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man
You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby, this is me you're talking to
You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man
It's not me, no
You got the wrong man
Mister can you take me into Little Rock
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck
I'll listen all night if you wanna talk
Just don't mention Memphis
And we can talk about your family
Politics, music, and philosophy
Any old subject's all right with me
Just don't mention Memphis
Or blue eyes and light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standin' there
So don't mention Memphis
Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup
We'll make Texas with a little luck
And I'm hangin' with ya till the sun comes up
So don't mention Memphis
Or blue eyes and light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standin' there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis
I rolled my Daddy's truck off the Dicksonville curve
After drinkin' my fifth beer
And I fed hogs tryin' to pay him off
For most of my senior year
I got my jaw jacked by a big ol' boy
For messing 'round with his girlfriend
She was tall and tight and she kissed just right
But I'll never do that again
Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way
I've been kicked in the face by a horse
'Cause I ran up too fast behind him
And I shook hands on a deal with a man
And found out he was lyin'
I've broken a couple of good girl's hearts
'Cause I've said I loved 'em knowin' I couldn't
And I've given my heart to a woman
Who said she'd stay when I knew she wouldn't
Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way
I've been bit I've been burned but I've lived and I've learned from it
I've made some mistakes but that's what it takes
To make a man out of a kid
Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way
Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way
That's how I got to be this
How I got to be this
How I got to be this way
A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
Wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah
I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet home Alabama and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Yeah I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah small town USA
Rifle in a gun rack hanging in the back glass
Buck knife on my belt, ain't no land for sale 'round here
Red clay country mud, sippin' on a cold Bud
Blue tick coon hound you know where I'm found out in the
Backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, workin' hard for a dollar in the
Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir
Preacher's daughter couldn't get hotter
Floating that river on an inner tube with her, splash

Ain't that just my luck where's the chain I'm stuck out in the
Backwoods down in the holler

I worked hard all week
But now your here with me
Staring up, at a summer sky
A blanket in the truck bed
Just give me the go ahead
'Cause baby we got plenty of time
Crickets are singing
Country moon is shinning
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
All I wanna do, is lay you down and love you
Like there's no tomorrow, tonight
Let me whisper in your ear
Make my intentions clear
We'll just be getting started come midnight
Get in a rhythm, nobody's near listening
Just you and me for miles and miles
Crickets are singing
Country moon is shinning
I can see the fire burnin in your eyes
All I wanna do, is lay you down and love you
Like there's no tomorrow, tonight
((End chorus))
Like there's no tomorrow, tonight...
Wear my name on the back of my belt
Believe there's a God to save me from hell
And dirt roads were made for country boys like me
Don't believe in politically correct
You wanna a piece better have a set
A rifle and a four wheel drive is all I need
Small mouth bass on the end of a hook
Daddy read from the good book
I'm just a country boy from this land
Makin' a living with these two hands
Still believe in the good ole American way
I watch 'em shut the factories down
Then the foreigners flood into town
They take what's left for half the pay
We can't stand by and just let it fade away
The good ole American way
Got sense enough to know things change
But the little man's getting screwed today
Somebody with a backbone please stand up
Oh we worked so hard to get this far
Now we're forgetting everything and just call it love
Don't tell me there ain't somethin' wrong
Somebody's gotta sing this song
I'm just a country boy from this land
Makin' a living with these two hands
Still believe in the good ole American way
I watch 'em shut the factories down
Then the foreigners flood into town
They take what's left for half the pay
We can't stand by and just let it fade away
The good ole American way
We can't stand by and just let it fade away
The good ole American way
I wear my name on the back of my belt
Believe there's a God to save me from hell
You got your million bucks

I know you're scared of that cock-a-doodle-do
Don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt ya
I know you ain't never milked a cow before
You ain't never slung hay from a second floor barn door
You never heard of Daisy or of Elly May, well that's okay, we got all day
Back that thing up

Hunny, back that thing up
If you gonna work a farm you gotta learn to drive a truck

There ya go
Well I was baptized at the Baptist church
And my old man taught me 'bout a hard day's work
I learned how to love, learned how to fight
It's where we keep our cash in a dresser drawer
Underneath the forty-four
And if we do you wrong we damn sure make it right
It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home
Your word is good on a handshake
Preacher still talks about a judgment day
People gonna stop when a funeral passes by
We say "yes sir" and say "yes ma'am"
Answer the call from Uncle Sam
Hit a bully in the nose if he crosses the line
It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home
My roots are buried deep here in this little town
And one of these days it's where they'll put me in the ground
It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home
You stood on that bank when I got baptized,
Gave me a 30-30 when I turned 9.
At 16 you caught me drinkin' out in the barn.
I could hear you cheerin' when we won state, and you held my hand at Grandma's grave.
And I'll always be thankful, that you never sold the farm.
Grandpa, you stood so tall,
Chewed that Red Man wore overalls.
You were the same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night.
You were five foot six to the top of your hat but, when you talked about the war I thought you were superman.
American born simple man with a southern drawl.
You walk the walk, talk the talk, Grandpa.
You still swear Roosevelt was the best.
That a home grown tomater tastes better than the rest and, fifty years goes too fast with a woman you love.
Well this life I've chose is gettin' busy now and when I walk up on your front porch;
It's just like I'm still young.
Grandpa, you stood so tall,
Chewed that Red Man wore overalls.
You were the same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night.
You were five foot six to the top of your hat but, when you talked about the war I thought you were superman.
American born simple man with a southern drawl.
You walk the walk, talk the talk, Grandpa.
Yeah, American born a dirt road man with that slow southern drawl.
A lot of things a country boy learns in life
How to shoot a gun and how to use a knife
But when I pulled into Hershey, PA
I took my guitar up on the big stage.
That night I did the best I could
Me and the boys played pretty darn good
Then I took myself out, sat in the crowd;
And learned how Bocephus shakes 'em down
You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
If you wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
If you ain't got a boat, you gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
You gotta Hank it
There was a smokin' little blonde sittin' next to me
Said how'd you make it here from Tennessee
She must've been late and didn't catch my show
But when you play at 7 that's the way it goes
So I tipped my hat and we sang along to Where Have All My Rowdy Friends Gone
I climbed up on the bus after the show
Had a shot of Jim Beam and we hit the road.
You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
You wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
Ain't got a boat, gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
You gotta Hank it
You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
You wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
Ain't got a boat, gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
She takes me to a party
Dressed up in city clothes
Pretending I'm somebody
Everybody oughta know
But once I get a cold beer in my hand
There ain't no mistaken who I am
I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
Oh I can't hide my redneck side
Went to meet her family
For a weekend in the sun
A big house on the ocean
Yeah we were really havin' fun
Till they cought me in the pool at 2am
Wearin nothin' but a farmers tan
I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
Oh I can't hide my redneck side
I like guitars in my music
Muscle in my cars
And I like girls that hang out at bars
No one can change the way they are
And I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
No I can't hide my redneck side
No I can't hide my redneck side
She likes an ice cold Bud pressed against her hand
Standing on the porch looking 'cross our land
Seeing the bass hit that top water
And that was my kind of woman first time I saw her.
Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a cane pole, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from
She's my kind of woman, good as they come.
She'd rather be on a lake than in a mall,
In a duck blind at daylight blowin' my call,
She likes to get hogwild in the middle of the day,
My kind of woman likes to roll in the hay,
Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a cane pole, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from
She's my kind of woman, good as they come.
Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a Zepco, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from
She's my kind of woman, good as they come.
Every day I drive to work across Flint River bridge
A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd hug all three of those girls we lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of "Me and Bobby McGee"
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away
Midnight in Albuquerque
Drunk again on a little Wild Turkey
Damned if her memory didn't show up right on time
I've driven through the rain, the snow and ice
I ain't hit the same town twice
Just lookin' for a place I figured she couldn't find
I thought by now she'd left me alone
Turned around and headed back home
And just let me be
Hell what does she want with me
Bartender set 'em up
Hell as long as she's here might as well stay drunk
Start fresh tomorrow somewhere down the road
Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her
Well she walked out and I bought a map
A couple towns and I'd be back
Some place I could hurt where no one knew my name
Yeah I started out in Little Rock
I've lost track of everywhere I stopped
I can't seem to drink enough to outrun the pain
You'd think by now her memory
Would get tired of following me
But tonight ain't the night
So before they turn out the lights
Bartender set 'em up
Hell as long as she's here might as well stay drunk
Start fresh tomorrow somewhere down the road
Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her
Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her
'Fore I get over her
Bird dog just had her puppies that's a hundred dollars cash apiece
This old boy struck it country rich
At least for a couple of weeks
I owe my daddy that 50 spot
And the muffler shop the rest
But daddy and bubba's gonna have to waiibe got an empty ice chest
Boys it's beer time
This ol' town's dry
Headed to the county line
For something cold
I need a twelve pack in a brown paper sack
Ice it down in the back
Find a deep mud hole
I got my baby and some rowdy friends of mine
It's beer time
I heard bocephus was coming to town and I still had a little cash
I bought me a couple of nose bleed tickets
Way up in the back
It chilled me to the bone when he sang got
A shotgun rifle and a four wheel drive
Crowd went crazy and I told my baby
It was worth every dime
Now it's beer time
Hearin' Hank play live country boy can survive
I need something cold
When the show ends party with my rowdy friends
Hell of a weekend
I ain't ready to go
Crack another top beneath the parking lot lights
It's beer time
Boys it's beer time
This ol' town's dry
Headed to the county line
For something cold
I need a twelve pack in a brown paper sack
Ice it down in the back
Find a deep mud hole
I got my baby and some rowdy friends of mine
It's beer time
It's 5 o'clock Friday afternoon
And it's beer time
Yeah the fish are biting in a honey hole
It's beer time
I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, 'cause he's into bein' green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eatin' that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love, sounds like it sucks...
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.
Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so...
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.
It won't be that long, till you start gettin' bored
I'll be smilin' on the river, realin' in one more...
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
Hell he don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, 'cause you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook
No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook
I've been on the Grand Ole Opry
I've played a show with ZZ Top
Went on tour with Skynyrd and man they still rock
Shot the bull with Bocephus, before he climbed up on his jet
Played south Florida with Alan Jackson
That's some things that you never forget
And all that stuff it makes you feel real good
But not near as good...
As flyin' down a back road
With some buddies from back home
A splash of Jack in my Coke
Catchin' brim on a Zebco
Spottin' deer in a hay field
After church a Sunday meal
Huggin' mama before I go
Flyin' down a back road
Up there in Des Moines, they knew my songs line by line
I just stood there in the fake smoke
Another dream came true that night
I've seen so many places, I thought I'd never see
All the way from California to as far as you can go East
And all that stuff it makes you feel real good,
But not near as good...
As flyin' down a back road
With some buddies from back home
A splash of Jack in my Coke
Catchin' brim on a Zebco
Spottin' deer in a hay field
After church a Sunday meal
And huggin' mama before I go
Yeah, flyin' down a back road
I'm a lucky man, I got a real good life
With all the things I've done nothin' gets me as high...
As flyin' down a back road
With some buddies from back home
A splash of Jack in my Coke
Catchin' brim on a Zebco
Spottin' deer in a hay field
After church a Sunday meal
And huggin' my mama before I go
Yeah, flyin' down a back road
Oh, flyin' down a back road
Don't you dare throw that beer can,
Stand in the back and cover your ears
Go sit in your car, till the show is over
If you don't like what you hear
Brother maybe you're in the wrong place,
If you don't like a rowdy crowd
We're about to get drunk, and go country on ya
Yeah, it's gonna get loud
No I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang
I've been singin' and playin' this guitar
Since I was twelve years old
It took me from a porch, to the Opry, to the radio,
To a whole lot of records sold
Well we must be doin' somethin' right,
'Cause we packed it out again
So don't let the door hit you in the ass,
And you can tell all your friends
No I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang
I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it down in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang
Said no, I don't care if you don't like my twang
I started out with a .410, then moved to a .20 gauge.
Every squirrel and rabbit in Dallas county knew my name.
I sat on the stand with PawPaw from the time I was three years old.
When I was eight I used a muzzle loader to kill my first doe.
These days I go down to Wal-Mart and they set 'em in the back.
Some people wanna take 'em away, why don't you go bust them boys that sellin' crack.
Guns, whether Remingtons and Glocks. 
Come on man it ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block. 
I'm gunna tell you once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
You wont take my guns. 
If there ever was a time we need 'em, 
I'd say it be today. 
When we're letting them terrorists watch cable TV and walk out of Guantanamo Bay. 
I just try to do the right thing and raise my family in this land. 
Treating me like you want to be treated and that's what I call a man.
If we don't have 'em, what do we do. Tell me where we gunna go.
Somebody breaks into my house, I'm gunna need my Colt .44.
Guns, whether Remingtons and Glocks.
Come on man it, ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block. 
I'm gunna tell you once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
You wont take my guns.
Listen.
Guns. Whether Remingtons or Glocks.
Come on man, it ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block.
I'm gunna tell once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
And I'm still breathing, 
You wont take my guns. 
No, you can take 'em from me when you take 'em from my grandpa and my daddy.
Down in Alabama they wear them little cutoffs,
In Georgia it's camo bikini tops,
South Carolina layin' on the Myrtle Beach,
Panama City drinkin' shots for free
That time I went out to California, had to dodge them on the PCH,
And over there in Little Rock sunnin' on the bass boat,
Sippin' on a cold one out on the lake
Them sunshine babies
All across the land workin' on a tan
Drivin' country boys crazy
All oiled down with a beer in their hand
Easy to spot, way too hot
I'm diggin' on what they got
Them sunshine babies
Hat turned backwards, flyin' down a back road
CJ 7, headed for the swimmin' hole
Me and the boys, hangin' out of the doors
Ain't got no fishin' pole, got no lures
'Cause what we're after's layin' up on the bank
They're jumpin' off that old rope swing
Barefoot in the mud, cooler on the tailgate
I can see 'em now, shakin' their thing
Them sunshine babies
All across the land workin' on a tan
Drivin' country boys crazy
All oiled down with a beer in their hand
Easy to spot, way too hot
I'm diggin' on what they got
Them sunshine babies
Them sunshine babies
All across the land workin' on a tan
Drivin' country boys crazy
All oiled down with a beer in their hand
Easy to spot, way too hot
I'm diggin' on what they got
Them sunshine babies, yeah,
I'm diggin' on what they got
Drivin' country boys crazy
People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, tryin' to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world
I can see why they're all talkin'
Lookin' back at my past
I've got a bad name, but a man can change
I'm livin' proof of that
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest,
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around,
And baby don't you ever forget
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Darlin' yes I will
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Oh babe, till my last day
We can pop a top on a bottle of Boone's.
Have a front row seat to a big full moon.
Kick back and listen to the crickets in the field.
Find a star we can call our own
Watch the lightning bugs 'til they're gone.
Light a fire of passion or lay real still.
In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy.
Baby slide off your boots down to your bare feet.
Those cut offs and tan lines are killin' me.
Move on over, lay your head on my shoulder, we'll stay a while.
Steal a little kiss as the whip-poor-will's,
Sing through the trees with a southern feel.
We can sit on the tailgate and wait till it feels right.
In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy.
In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy.
In the bed of my Chevy.
I've been a rough houser, a good time sleep arounder
A straight up whiskey pounder, till I don't know my name
I've been a church goer, a front pew bible holder
A cry on my momma's shoulder when she saw me change
But each day's a choice, which one I'm gonna be...
God bless outlaws like me
I curse the sun, I pray for rain
I've run a mile to walk through pain
I've seen the worst and I've seen the best that I could be
God bless outlaws like me
I've been an SOB'er, a night time bar room leaner
A go back and forth betweener, and that's the truth
And I've been a come home early, get to my girl in a hurry
At night so she didn't worry, I even said I love you
But each day's days a choice, to love her or livin' free...
God bless outlaws like me
I curse the sun, I pray for rain
I've run a mile to walk through pain
I've seen the worst and I've seen the best that I could be
God bless outlaws like me
I curse the sun, I pray for rain
I've run a mile to walk through pain
I've seen the worst and I've seen the best man I can be
God bless outlaws, God bless outlaws
God bless outlaws like me
What's wrong with sayin' yes sir, sayin' yes ma'am, a hard day's work
Showin' up pretty much on time
What's wrong with waitin' your turn, payin' your dues, keepin' your word
And lookin' a man right in the eye
You can wear your pants down around your knees
But that don't mean a dang to me
Just put a little old back in the new school
Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school
I don't mind some attitude, a rebel heart, hell I got one too
But you still gotta walk the line
I don't care what you listen to, how you wear your hair you can paint it blue
Hey, it takes all kinds
Johnny rocked and Willie rolled, they just did it with a whole lot more soul
Just put a little old back in the new school
Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school
My grandpa just turned 83
I hope some of him rubbed off on me
He's still cooler than I'll ever be
Just put a little old back in the new school
(Yeah) Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school
Yeah I might be young but I ain't no fool
Come on, let's put a little old back in the new school
Yeah, new school
Put some old back in it
That water tower's got the sun goin' down behind it. 
If there's a good time in this town, girl, we're gonna find it. 
You look so damn good climbin' up in my Chevy 
Tryin' to play it cool but I knew already 
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights 
It was gonna be one of those nights. 
Got the Kenwoods bangin' that rock 'n' roll. 
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go? 
I can ride ya 'round town or drive ya down some old back road. 
I love the way ya lean that seat back, 
Steal my ball cap, pull it down over your blue eyes 
Watchin' your hair fly out the window 
Lettin' the night roll 
And I can't wait to see where it goes. 
We can run the reds down Main Street dodgin' the blue lights 
Or disappear out into the corn out past the county line 
Baby keep on, keep on swayin' to the back beat 
Long as you're right here, right here beside me 
You make the call, baby I don't care 
We can take this anywhere. 
Got the Kenwoods bangin' that rock 'n' roll. 
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go? 
I can ride ya 'round town or drive ya down some old back road. 
I love the way ya lean that seat back, 
Steal my ball cap, pull it down over your blue eyes 
Watchin' your hair fly out the window 
Lettin ' the night roll 
And I can't wait to see where it goes.
I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
I wake up and I make two black cups of coffee
The routine being with you taught me left its mark
These old, old habits die hard
I get in the car and turn the radio on
Expecting you to sing along but you never start
It's a lonely road and I can't see where it ends
Where I'm goin' and where we've been are so far apart
These old, old habits die hard
I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
'Cause old, old habits die hard
These four walls are slowly closing in around me
Without your light I'm here drowning in the dark
I pick up the phone then I come straight to my senses
I know the consequences of going that far
Old, old habits die hard
I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
These old, old habits die hard
I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
I've always been one of them boys 
Rollin' around in jacked up toys 
Making noise on small town Friday nights 
Red light running, good time chasing, 
Guess I've earned this reputation 
Probably never shake it but that's alright 
I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side 
I just point at you 
Yea, point at you 
Girl I ain't sure just what it is 
That's got me all tore up like this 
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone 
I still like to get a little crazy 
But something about your loving baby 
It breaks me down and makes me wanna haul ass home 
I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side 
I just point at you 
Point at you yeah 
Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me 
Lord knows I'm hard to hold 
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides 
And I ain't letting you go 
Cause my best side is holding me close 
Point at you, yeah 
I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side 
I just point at you 
Oh baby, I just point at you 
Girl I point at you 
Oh babe my best side is you 
Girl I point at you
Looks like two cute little pigs in a toe sack
I'm telling you right now, baby you got back
You're shaking it low at a country show
Everybody's saying whoa whoa
Just look at that bobo
I know you know
You're a little bit of J-Lo
A little bit of Kim Kardashian
It's big, it ain't tiny, I'm diggin' that hiney
It's a classy one
Might be a bullshitter
But I ain't no ass kisser
'Least I've never been one before
But if there's anybody's ass I'd kiss
I'd want it to be yours, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hate to see you go but I love to watch you leave girl,
Those Daisy Dukes and boots are rockin' my world
Even Snoop D.O. Double G would be jealous of me in this Chevy
When you're on this bench seat
'Cause girl your booty's
A little bit of J-Lo
A little bit of Kim Kardashian
It's big, it ain't tiny, I'm diggin' that hiney
It's a classy one
Might be a bullshitter
But I ain't no ass kisser
'Least I've never been one before
But if there's anybody's ass I'd kiss
I'd want it to be yours, whoa, whoa, whoa
Those watermelons you got shoved in your pants
Make me wanna take a bite when you dirty dance
36-24-39
Girl your behind is
A little bit of J-Lo
A little bit of Kim Kardashian
It's big, it ain't tiny, I'm diggin' that hiney
It's a classy one
Might be a bullshitter
But I ain't no ass kisser
'Least I've never been one before
But if there's anybody's ass I'd kiss
I'd want it to be yours, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh I'd want it to be yours, whoa, whoa
I'd want it to be yours
In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
'Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's gotta be
This kind of town
In this kind of town we know how to fix it
We know how to make it, we know how to mix it
Friday night lasts all weekend long
We crank it up loud and sing a little song about
This kind of town
We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
In this kind of town there's peanuts in a bottle
The old men ramble at the brand new McDonald's
Talk about the war and the football team
Saying Lordy me I never thought I'd live to see this kind of town
We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town
No it ain't everything but let me tell you, it's everything
In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again they don't really leave
'Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's gotta be
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I got the Chevy backed down a boat ramp
Tailgate down we got some good jams
Summertime just got a little hotter
Your toes tappin' along in the water
Crank it on up
Pour a little in your cup
You and that backbeat are getting to me
Slide on over
Get a little closer
The beer's on ice
And we got all night
Let's catch a little buzz
Baby, it's just us
And the lightning bugs
And country radio
We'll keep the key turned back to accessory
Turned on the way you're turning me
On in the glow of the dashboard
Let's get to rockin' this 4x4
Crank it on up
Pour a little in your cup
You and that backbeat are getting to me
Slide on over
Get a little closer
The beer's on ice
And we got all night
Let's catch a little buzz
Baby, it's just us
And the lightning bugs
And country radio
Girl you're lookin' so good
It's feelin' so right
You got me thinkin'
We could do it all night
Crank it on up
Pour a little in your cup
You and that backbeat are getting to me
Slide on over
Get a little closer
The beer's on ice
And we got all night
Let's catch a little buzz
Baby, it's just us
And the lightning bugs
And country radio
Yeah a little country radio
Country radio
Saturday night my first high school dance
Showin up late in my sundays best
Seen you before ah but not in that dress
The DJ's last song and I lost the dare
So with my heart and my pride on the line
I asked you to dance for our first time right there
Holding hands in the hall
All night wait for your call its 2 am and were still on the phone
Hanging out at the mall oh that old picture show
I reach for your lips girl first taste of love
That old ford truck was your daddy's worst fear
Oh I remember the way love felt in freshman year
Graduated in may we went our separate ways
Till the hole in my heart was too much to take
You made that drive down to my dorm room that night
Every knock at the door you go and hide
And I thought I'd drown in the tears that you cried
Just a holdin' on tight
We found a way to relight that old fire that night
We were young and wild hanging out to late at night at all those college bars cheap natty light
Just like one of the guys you stuck right by my side at every football game there with a smile
Two in the crowd screaming go dawgs go
Oh I remember the way love felt in freshman year
Oh we're still young and wild hanging out to late at night in all these college bars cheap natty light
Just like one of the guys you stuck right by my side at every football game there with a smile
Two in the crowd screaming go dawgs go
Oh I remember the way love felt in freshman year
Oh that's freshman year
Grand daddy used to take me
Down town to the kinneys
That's where all the old men go to reminisce
Ramble on about history dust off some old stories
Look back at the life they've come to miss
I swear sometimes I can almost see
A picture of this small town back in 1943
Everything's black and white
And there's dirt on the street
It don't look at all what I'm seein' today
Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around
It's in my blood it's where I settle down
Lay me in the ground under what's left of a small town
You can still get a hair cut for less than ten bucks
If you go down to buds right off the square
It's been almost 10 years since they closed down that old mill
That's what this whole town was built around
There's a couple old dirt roads
Left down by old potts' farm
We used to throw down hard out there man we never did no harm
Well the counties offered thousands, man that old Potts won't give in
There development stops right at that barbed wire fence
Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around
It's in my blood it's where I settle down
Lay me in the ground under what's left of a small town
Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around
It's in my blood it's where I settle down
Lay me in the ground under what's left of a small town
I had a buddy come down 'round last July
Called me when he crossed the Mason-Dixon Line
Said he was headed down south and looking for a real good time.
I said, "Man, come on, I got a place in mind."
We pulled up at bar right off the Georgia line.
Walked in, man, his eyes got wide
And when his jaw hit the floor, all I could do was smile.
He said, "Man, we got some pretty women up north
But I ain't never seen nothing like this."
I said, "Man, these here ain't ordinary women.
We call these grits."
She's a product of being raised in the country.
She knows her roots and works hard for her money.
A southern drawl with dark tan legs.
Ain't nothin' like a woman southern born and bred.
Now she loves her mama, daddy, and the Lord to death.
Acting innocent and playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town.
Grits, man - a girl raised in the south.
Sat down at the bar had a couple drinks.
Breakin' his neck just scoping the scene.
It wasn't long before he had my attention pointed towards the door.
He was starin' at long legs that ran into boots.
Her short skirt and her t-shirt didn't have much use
But she walked right to the jukebox and fired it up.
She had every head turning, boys eyes was burning
As she made her way out to the floor.
Had all the jealous girls looking, all saying,
"She ain't nothin' but a..."
Oh my God, she just broke it down low.
Product of being raised in the country.
She knows her roots and works hard for her money.
A southern drawl with dark tan legs.
Ain't nothin' like a woman southern born and bred.
Now she loves her mama, daddy, and the Lord to death.
Good at acting innocent and playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town.
Grits, man - a girl raised in the south.
She's a product of being raised in the country.

She's acting innocent but playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town.
Grits, man - a girl raised in the south.
She comes home late at night
Kicks her high heels off and sighs
And lays down on the bed
She said it's been a long day at work
I couldn't wait till I got home
To be with you again
Lord I love just to watch her sleeping
Ya I just pull the covers up
And wonder what she's dreamin'...
Well she's wrapped up
With a T-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radios got her favorite song
And she's singin' right along
Oh
Let your hair down, baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper I love you while your driftin off again
Whenever we're alone
Took her out last Friday night
Let her dance under neon light
And that girl she's turnin' heads
Strangers eyes right on my girl
Can't blame him man she's beautiful
She's comin' home with me
And Lord her beauty is hard to hide
I'm countin' my blessin every night
Well she's wrapped up
With a T-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radio has got her favorite song
And she's singin' right along
Oh
Let your hair down, baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper I love you while your driftin off again
Whenever we're alone
I found box of memories, read a letter dropped tear where you signed your name, turnin' the page, smearin' the ink in love always, girl I always start this way, then I end up in a bottle screamin' out you name, punchin' the walls carryin' on like I've gone insane, and in the mirror I can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse, watchin' an angel cry tears as she stepped over my beers headed out the door.
There ain't nothin' like a memory, when its comin' on strong like a hurricane, how could love like that just up and walk away, killin' me baby, its got me pourin' up another drink, burboun's hittin' me hard like a freight train, with my back against the wall or on my knees, when worst of your memory gets the best of me.
Well I remember it all too well, ridin' 441 down to Milledgeville, crossin' the bridge as the sun set on Lake Sinclair, I couldn't wait to see your smile, but all I saw was tears in your pretty eyes, and that said it all, it was all downhill from there, and I remember you sayin' baby please don't give up on me, but this stubborn man is gonna line the bed he made,
There ain't nothin' like a memory, when its comin' on strong like a hurricane, how could love like that just up and walk away, its killin' me baby, its got me pourin' up another drink, burboun's hittin' me hard like a freight train, with my back against the wall or on my knees, when worst of your memory gets the best, the best of me
Baby, there ain't nothin' like a memory, when its comin' on strong like a hurricane, how could love like that just up and walk away, killin' me baby, its got me pourin' up another drink, burboun's hittin' me hard like a freight train, with my back against the wall or on my knees, when worst of your memory gets the best, the best of me
Yeah, I worked all week,
Cleaned up, clean cut and clean shaved.
Get the cover off the '68,
Fire it up let them horses sing,
A little pretty thing, a little tan-legged georgia dream,
She's a rockin' them holey jeans.
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday,
You know, words got it, there's gonna be a party, outta town bout half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires,
Muscadine wine.
Oh you can find me in back of a ford truck tailgate,
Sittin' round watchin all these pretty things gettin' down in that georgia clay,
And I'll find peace in the bottom of a real tall cold drink,
Chillin' to skynyrd and some old hank.
Let's get this thing started it's my kind of party.
Girl if your gonna drink,
Go baby just do your thing,
Give up *your* keys.
Well hell why drive when you can stay with me.
And after while we'll sneak away from the bon-fire, walk by the moon-light and down to the river side,
Got you sippin on the moonshine.
Baby if you're in the mood,
We can settle for a one night rodeo,
If you can be my tan-legged juliet,
I'll be your redneck romeo. oh baby
Where y'all goin'?
We still got a keg breathin.
I set out one night in the fast lane bound for freedom
In a truck that daddy bought me
And money mom had saved for school
I laid down all my books and picked up the drinking
Hell I let 'em down
When I gave up like a fool
And one reckless night just lookin' for my whiskey
I found a bible mama gave me and read a while
I read a story 'bout a man who lived just like me
Then finally ate his pride and came runnin' home
And lord I'm a renegade, a rambler
I've squandered all I've owned
A bonified runaway, I'm a gambler
Can't count the lies I've told
And I need redemption, how 'bout forgiveness
And I pray for open arms, and be with me lord
'Cause I'm comin' home, like a modern day prodigal son
I had all of my things packed by early mornin'
I left that bottle I'd lost right there on the bathroom floor
I stopped at a payphone and called back home to mama
Yeah she might not even talk after all I've done
The phone rang twice before I got an answer
And mama nearly dropped the phone when she heard me say
I said mama it's your son and will y'all have me
She said son you know I've longed for this day
-Chorus Again 2x-
It's all around town
Here's ten cents for mistakes he's made
It's all word of mouth
Oh but they say that's the price you pay
When you're in with the wrong crowd
Oh look at the mess you've made
Starring you down, every time you show your face
Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I've had enough
It ain't their place to judge
Man I'm giving up
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up
She's made up her mind
This mistakes going to have a name
She's in for the nine
Awe but she just turned 18
It's a matter of time
Before she hits these streets
You say it ain't right
Aw but she don't wear no ring
Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I've had enough
It ain't their place to judge
Man I'm giving up
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up
So let the sinless man, cast the first stone
And may the judgment in my life, belong to God alone

And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up
This city's looking like a ghost town
All the stores downtown they've been closing down
Yeah, the only lights that shine for miles
Are lighting up the sky above memorial drive
And if you want a seat you better come on down
'Cause when the band fires up that old glory sound
This is the moment we've all been waiting for
Lining them up, and the whistle blows
This ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night
And winning state would be a miracle
Man, we did it back in '54
And if the baptist church prayed Sunday morning
We might just stand a chance with the help of the Lord
This is ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So, everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night
And now the stadium's quiet
Standing here alone on this old 50 yard line
If I listen close I can hear battle cries
Of all the heroes come and gone before I was alive
The memories of fourth and three
Now that rival game is coming back to me
It meant more than a big state ring
If we could do it again it'd never be the same
Remember the lights and the butterflies
Giving it all just one last time
Because heroes are remembered but dragons never die
This is ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So, everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night
Come on
Grew up one state north of Kentucky
Family far from rollin' in the money.
Seven brothers and sisters to feed and love.
Granddaddy said she kept her eyes on the sky,
Watchin' all the little birds fly
Starin' at heaven like a lost home
None of her dreams held fame and fortune
She wanted a husband and children that loved her
Spreading her wings,
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Traveling down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel.
Baby back home your daddy's dying,
Bout then came a perfect timing,
Walked in with liquor on my breath,
I sit and watched all her tears glisten,
Said son you'll learn to listen,
A man stands tall in front of his knees.
Now I'll never forget how much that hurt,
That she said son, one day I'll be gone, you won't have to hear these words.
Spreading her wings
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Traveling down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel,
Indiana's Angel.
Spreading her wings
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Driving down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel.
I'm tired of this 9 to 5
8 hours feeling like over time
And my mind's reminding me,
I got a show tonight
Getting home, it's already 8:30
My strings are old and man, my clothes are dity
But jimmy's always late, so man I'm right on time
There's a little old college bar right off of old 129
Said they'd pay me just a little bit of money
To sing my songs tonight
It's 10:00, get ready to rock, let's roll
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
Play it all from skynyrd to Jones
And some of my own
5'10 with a suntan and southern drawl
In the front row singing along
Yeah it's all about the country sound
Yeah, we're gonna rock this town
Sweet home to brown eyed girl
Trying my best to remember the words
And there's always some drunk in the back
Screaming out Free Bird
Take a break, and head to the bar
Shake a couple hands, got me feeling like a star
And I know it's the bottle talking, hell I don't mind
Y'all I ain't cose to famous
But I love to play and sing
And this may be a honkey tonk bar
But I'm still living a dream
It's 10:00, get ready to rock, let's roll
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
Play it all from skynyrd to Jones
And some of my own
5'10 with a suntan and southern drawl
In the front row singing along

In the front row singing along

Yeah, we're gonna rock this town
You ain't nothin' like your memory at least it hangs around and that old photograph you gave me
Girl I can't bare to lay it down
And when this bottles empty
Girl I'm gonna paint this town
Yeah after all we're said and done
I don't have one good reason you should turn and come back home
Or the right to blame you girl I don't have much at all
I still got you picture taped to the dashboard on the mantle right by the front door you said if you leave you'd never come back well baby I don't believe that's were it's at it's all of wrong times all of the right things in my right mind to say thinks I don't mean but baby that's me and it's way to late but I still got your picture on the dashboard
And I ain't like I use to be tough as hell and hard to please but you came along and this old boy hit his knee
And the day was to much without you yeah my life revolved around you and you dropped a stone down on my heart and now I can't move on 'cause we danced to all our songs up to midnight all alone
I still got you picture taped to the dashboard on the mantle right by the front door you said if you leave you'd never come back well baby I don't believe that's were it's at it's all of wrong times all of the right things in my right mind to say thinks I don't mean but baby that's me and it's way to late oh I still got your picture on the dashboard

She's stopping by real late tonight, just to talk.
She said I got some things that been weighing on my mind,
And I know I can come.
And we just sit and we talk a while
While she spills her heart on that couch of mine.
And it won't be long till the guitar starts to play.
I already know what she's gonna say,
Oh she says...
Play me that song, play me that song you wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much you care, or how much you love her.
Play me that song, play me that song again
'Cause I like to think there's someone there
Who might love me just like that,
So play me that song again.
Wasted time on a small town guy, nothing but drama.
And she wonders why it's almost every time she cries,
She ends up at my house.
She knows I don't give a damn about the who and where, or what they said.
I just take my pride and walk away.
Play me that song, play me that song you wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much you care, or how much you love her.
Play me that song, play me that song again
'Cause I like to think there's someone there
Who might love me just like that,
So play me that song again.
Girl you know I gotta tell you the truth,
I can't hide it no more.
I can't believe you didn't see through
The hiding, disguises, every time I'm singing,
Well there it is.
Baby that song, baby that song I wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much I care, or how much I love her.
Baby that song, I gotta tell you the truth
I've been hiding this so long from you.
Baby that song you love so much,
Is all about you.
So man, you think you wanna run whiskey
Roll with me, helps you better listen good and clear
And if you got a badge or a big mouth
Brother, you ain't got no business here
The bonus here as the moonshine's still
You can smell that whiskey burn
This is how the big dogs run, boy, you're riding shotgun
Buckle up and let's have some fun
Riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
A duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in your hood, heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar and brother, I'm hell on wheels
I said, I'm hell on wheels
Just nine more miles until state line
We're on time and we lost Barney's blues
So you can open your eyes, you're done fine
In this dangerous part of what we do
When we make that drop, we're gonna pop a top
You got a lesson left to learn
It ain't wine, don't sip it, make it bubble when you hit it
Let it burn, baby, burn
And we'll be riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
There's duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in the hood heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar and brother, I'm hell on wheels, yeah
I said, I'm hell on wheels
And riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
There's duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in the hood heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar
Riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
Duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in the hood heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar and brother, I'm hell on wheels
Thank you, pretty boy
I said I'm hell on wheels, yeah
Brother, I'm hell on wheels, yeah
Growing up I was always mama's angel
Never thought I'd ever fall from grace
I was taught to walk for God and run from trouble
But I ran with a crowd that was bound to change my ways
Yeah, I was proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one my mama warned me about
The closest thing to hell she's ever raised
But when I look back on those days
I knew I'd never change a thing
I made mistakes that paved the way
For the man I am today
I'm proud of 'em all and I had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law
We were bad about sneaking out and shooting road signs
Throwing eggs and rolling every yard in town
Yeah, my claim to fame was a babe, Ruth swing on a mailbox
Yeah, the police just loved driving me around
'Cause I was proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one my mama warned me about
The closest thing to hell she ever raised
But when I look back on those days
I knew I'd never change a thing
I made mistakes that paved the way
For the man I am today
I'm proud of 'em all and I had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law
And you learn to walk the way you talk
The D-U-I means S-O-L, respect was earned
You live and learn to pray, yeah, yeah
You learn to pray
Yeah, we were proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one our mamas warned us about
The closest thing to hell they'd ever raised
But when I look back on those days
I knew we'd never change a thing
Made mistakes that paved the way
For the men we are today
I'm proud of 'em all, yeah, and we had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law
Yeah, I was bending the rules and breaking the law
Mamma, she's still got that picture
Of me and Katie on home coming night
She looked pretty in that fancy dress
But that girl was a barefoot, blue jean princess
A hand full of rocks and daddy's pine ladder
Sure did come in handy
For a teenage boy thinking all that mattered
Was a kiss that taste like candy
Back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day
Friday nights I'd look up there in the bleachers
And I can see her with my letterman's jacket on
And I still got this scar here on my right hand
From when Bobby told her she deserved a better man
Aw, she hung right with me down in Panama City
Raising hell on our senior trip
And man ain't it funny it gets the best of me
And I just can't forget, I just can't forget
Back in the day we were wild and free
She was the dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day
Summer was over
My college was calling man I had to watch her leave
But I still wonder if she ever thinks of me
'Cause back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
It feels like yesterday, back in the day
Back in the day
She says, "Look, baby, I'm a rock star"
Grabs my old guitar
Playing it upside down
Dancing 'round in front of our TV
I can't see the ballgame
So I just wave my lighter around and say
"Yeah, rock on, baby
I'd rather watch you anyway"
"But when you're done can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that Zeppelin shirt of mine you're wearing?
I'll never wash that thing again"
Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy
You ought to see her in my pickup
Oh, she's gotta have that radio up
Bless her heart, she can't sit still
Head in my lap, bare feet on the windshield
Says, "Come on, baby, let me drive"
Now honey, it's a stick shift
Remember what you did last time, oh
Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy
She never lets me rest, she keeps me up all night
Known to roll me off the bed, steal the covers off my side
But I hear her wake up, sleepy head
And I open up my eyes and it's all worth the while
Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy
Welcome to the home of a hillbilly, yeah baby
It's a land of barbed wire, moonshine, whiskey
Park your car 'fore you get it stuck
Go on grab you a beer and get on up in the truck
It's going down tonight, it's all on me
It's B-Y-O-B and I've got all we need
Yeah boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time
We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
So pop a top and drop a tailgate
Yeah, we cranking up AC/DC, Hank, Skynyrd and George Strait
Where's the girls? 'Bout to call 'em up
A little southern drawl said, "Hey trouble, what's up?"
It's going down tonight, now they're pulling up
We got the jacked up trucks so slap covered in mud
Bikini tops and daisy duke denim
Hopping out, singing outlaw women down on
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time
We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
We're throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
Hey boy, hit this mason job one time
Burned you a little bit, didn't it?
Ever been snipe hunting? Come on
We'll do a little frog gigging, cow tipping
Now how 'bout a little skinny dipping, bass fishing?
Take it easy on the shine, stay away from other boy's women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
These boys tough down here
Get your ass tore up down here
And be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers they all came
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time
We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
We're throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
There's a live oak tree
You can still see off old 129
You can see the scars, its missing bark
Where it stopped my truck that night
They say I took a swing at my best friend
For trying to take my keys
Next thing I knew I was upside down
Thinking this is it for me
When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you
You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which one's your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been a halfway to Heaven
First thing I did was hug my momma
I even hugged my dad
I told them both how much I love them
Never saw daddy cry like that
Started hanging out with my little brother
Man, I never missed a game
I'm in church every Sunday morning
And I pray every day
When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you
You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been halfway to Heaven
And I won't waste one minute
Yeah, my life's changed
And I'm gonna live it
Like I'm hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones my last breath
Knowing there's so much I've left to do
I live my life a better man, live my life a better man
'Cause I've been halfway to Heaven
Halfway to Heaven
Amy's got the letters I wrote
My picture in a frame
She's had a year to let go
She's still wearing my ring
It hasn't left her finger
Since the night that I proposed
When I promised her forever
Before I took her home
But I never made it home that night
A part of her died too
I watched her losing her mind
And there's nothing I can do, oh
Sometimes she goes crazy
Screaming out my name
Saying, "Baby, please come and save me"
I wish she knew I'd do anything
To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time
Oh, but God, I know I can't
You can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy
Now 3 years have gone by
She's trying to live her life
And I still watch her sometimes
Just to make sure she's alright
She knows I'll always be there
In her heart and in her dreams
'Cause God, I promised her forever
And that's one promise I intend to keep
To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time
Oh, but God, I know I can't
But you can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy
I'll kiss the tears right off her face
When I walk her through these gates
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
Make up for lost time
God, I thank you everyday
For giving a her that ounce of faith
That led her right back here to me
And most of all for saving Amy
Saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy, yeah
For saving Amy, for saving Amy
Saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
Grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working, spitting, hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gassing up the other day
An old boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought, oh, good Lord, he's lost
From his Wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
A country must be country wide
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
It ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back to anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day, before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And old Hank, he said it all
When he said country folks can survive
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide, yeah
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
Back in the good old days
Knew how to brawl
I'm talking real gunslingers
I'm talking real outlaws
They'd saddle up and ride on into town
When it was high noon in them old saloons
You knew what was going down
They took it outside, took it outside
It was man to man, it's toe to toe
You know they had to go
Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until you've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside
These days things have changed
There's a lot of talk, lot of pushing and shoving
Well, if you wanna walk the walk
Well, let's have some respect
They got girls in here, just pay your tab
Lay down your beer hoss
And let's take it outside, let's take it outside
It's man to man, it's toe to toe
You know we need to go
Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah
We're all here for a good time
Don't start no trouble
'Cause it won't be the first time
I put a scar on my knuckles
Now brother, I don't mind
And I'll be glad to stomp your ass
But if both of us walk out that door
One of us ain't coming back
Nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah
Look at them boys in the back of that truck
Somebody ought to jerk a knot in their butts
Out riding around like they own this town
That racket turned all the way up
It's too early for school to let out
The Pastor's boy just threw a cigarette out
I sure hope there ain't beer in them cups
'Cause our star quarterback's turning them up
Them boys don't know one thing about life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules and balls and chains
Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?
I heard old Frank's grandson got caught
With a case full of beer that Smith boy bought
Y'all didn't hear all of this from me
But I heard they got it with a fake ID
Them boys don't know one thing about life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules or balls and chains
Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?
With them boys
Looking back on the times we've shared
From rock 'n roll to these rocking chairs
The same ones our granddads sat in
By this old wood stove in this hardware store
Talking the gossip, the weather and war
And how much trouble we were in
Oh, you can bet they said back then
Yeah, them boys don't know one thing 'bout life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules or balls and chains
Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?
They don't know a thing
About love, about life
Them boys
A whisper away from changing everything
But is it safe to say such dangerous things?
And your hands are trembling
Girl, I'm weak in the knees
It's times like these
When silence means everything
More than anything
So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
And I'll love you right off your feet
Until you fall into me
Love ain't a race, there's no finish line
And I love a chance but don't leave me behind
'Cause, girl, we're both gambling
But I'm playing for keeps
It's times like these
When patience means everything
More than anything
So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
I'll love you right off your feet
And I'll fall for you every day
I'll cherish the moments, time can't erase
We'll be the love song
I promise you we're gonna sing
Girl, when you fall in me
Girl, when you fall in me
Come on, baby, fall into me, yeah
I'm waiting, fall into me, fall into me, fall into me
A whisper away from changing everything
You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires
Back in the day pop bomb was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and gin were a few good friends
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man this shit is getting old
Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
No time for talking y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'
You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires
I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
We like cornbread and biscuits
If it's broke round here we fix it
See I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different round here that's right
And we sho do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road wit a truck and four wheel
Jump on in tell yo friends
And we'll be raising hell where the black top ends
You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires
Yeah I'm chillin' on the back roads
Laid back bobbin' to some George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires
Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
I bet she's still crying on the front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view
Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I suppose to do
There's still more than miles in my rear view
Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her (damn)
So I'm turning back to Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can't put my dreams before her
Man I need her here with me
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in back tonight
Now I know what I'm suppose to do, yeah
There's still more than miles in my rear view
More than miles, yeah
More than miles
Hey ol' friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Now she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
Might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say I'll stop hurting
To hear somebody say she ain't worth it,
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
 
I can't forget, or drink away these memories.
It fills my soul with all the little things.
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
Don't try to tell me it stops hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend
There's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
They said I was baptized in dirty water
By the hands of the devil himself
Between the banks of a Whiskey River
Beside the Highway to Hell
I got scars on my heart and knuckles
I got debts that I can't pay
Yeah but I got a blessing sent down from heaven
Baby you're my saving grace
Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me
You'd tell me how did I get under
This leather skin I wear
Beneath the callouses and tattoos
Around the walls I've built down there
To this heart I've broke and guarded
All alone out on the street flyin' 
Yea it takes an angel to fly with a freebird
Baby we've got the sky
Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me
Hell on an angel, on an angel
Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me
I'm sure you've heard my reputation it's all over this small town
But there's a little bit of fire under all that smoke
You know how word gets around
Back in the day you were a straight A student
Daddy's little girl, honey what are you doin'
Talkin' 'bout lettin' your hair down
We'll take a ride on the wild side of town
If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy
Well I'll be out by your driveway when your mom and dad lay down
You can climb on out that window babe
And we'll get on out of town
I'll call up all my rowdy friends
We'll throw down where the dirt road ends
I'll have you back before the rooster crows
Girl your mom and daddy ain't gotta know
If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy
Slide over here
If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Bad boy
Girl you know you want a bad boy
There ain't nothing like 'em first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights come n' dances
Givin' my old letterman's jacket away
To hold us a name
But now it's you and me talking on the phone 'til 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
Girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she ain't got nothin' on you tonight
'Cause you're like the summer lovin' don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like a first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Lookin' back I wish I could put you inside every memory
(Every memory)
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything
Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
And climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get your butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Yeah just like we're 17 again
17 again
Oh
You might be sitting there holding my hand
And you might be acting like you're my man
While we listen to the cover band, thinking you're a rockstar,
Singing my favorite song
Trying to cover up the fact that the girl from your past
Hasn't been here all along
You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing
Baby, I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh
I might be platinum blond, but I ain't dumb
Baby, I see you're here with me, but you ain't moved on
Sitting in the middle of a flame still burning,
Boy, I ain't your match
You can stop all the pretending 'cause when this night's ending
You're still gonna want her back
You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing
Baby, I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh

The smile, the charm, the words, the spark,
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart, cause boy,
I let you have it
You said I was your only,
I never thought you'd leave me lonely
You're just a lost boy, 
You're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan
Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
But now it's happily ever never
I guess now I know better
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground
You're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up

You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
Yeah, you'll never grow up
And you're never gonna be a man,

What if we were all the same?
Same rules, same game
And we weren't allowed to change anything about anything 
That anybody's ever done before?
Wouldn't that be boring?, yeah
Always spinning on a ride, all walking on a line
That they drew a long time ago
When you know that you don't have to go where they go
You can go write your own story
Hey, hey, you gotta be
Who you oughta be
So who do you wanna be?
Oh
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say you can be, a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round
La da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da 
La da da da da da da da da
There's a lot of open doors you can go and explore
You can always open more if you're hitting a wall
Dropping the ball, haven't we all
Been down that same hallway?
So let 'em talk and whisper, let 'em try to fix ya
Repaint your picture, at the end of the day
It fits in your frame, just 'cause you're different don't mean you're crazy
Hey, hey, you gotta sing
Like nobody's listening 
'Cause somebody's listening, yeah
Oh
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say you can be, a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round
They make the world go 'round
Hey, hey, you gotta be
Who you oughta be
So who do you wanna be?
Whoa, oh
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say you can be, a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round
Hey, you gotta be
Who you wanna be, so
Who do you wanna be?
Square pegs make the world go 'round
Hey, you gotta be
Who you wanna be, so
Who do you wanna be?
Square pegs make the world go 'round
I put on my make up
Spray my perfume
Sat on the front porch, waitin' on you
Said we would catch up because it had been awhile
I hate to admit it
But my hands are shaking
Barely breathin'
Heart is racin'
Looks like feelings don't always change their minds
But you never called, never showed up
Guess somethings never change
And just like living in a flashback... you let me down again
That's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time
I should know better
I hate that I still cry
Lookin' like a fool here watchin' for headlights
And kickin' myself for believin' in you again
I bet your out drinkin' with a new blonde and
Telling her whatevers playin' is her song
Yeah and helping her up into your Chevy instead
Even when you don't have me
You can still be the one to hurt me
It must feel good to know
That I'm still holdin' on to letting go
That's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time
Yeah that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
So I'm letting you go, just like I should have tried
The first time
The night is young and so are we, so you what you say
We go and see it all for ourselves?
Yeah, yeah
There's a spot I know down the road we can go
Only me and you and no one else
Yeah, yeah
I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound
So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark,
Looking at stars
We can rename constellations while we're making wishes
Don't it make you feel so small?
Yeah, yeah
We can talk about forever for a minute, maybe never,
Just kiss and say nothing at all
Yeah, yeah
Baby, hurry up and get here
So we can disappear
The clouds are breaking, don't keep me waiting
Never seeing a night this clear
So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark,
Looking at stars
I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound
So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark,
Looking at stars
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just looking at stars
(Ooh)
Well, your reputation beats you to this
Little town like breaking news
Of a devastation that you left behind
Well, I ain't scared of a little rain
And I watch that spinning weather vane
I guess I just ain't the running kind
(Ooh, ooh)
They all watch from windows as I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens
Well, I let you crumble every wall
With your hail as hard as a cannonball
'Cause I like the risk that's in your reckless touch
And I've always had a weakness for
A terrible and twisted storm
'Cause your kiss is an adrenaline rush
(Ooh, ooh)
I knew what I was chasing when I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens
Oh, mmm
Maybe I'll know better the next time I hear that
Ooh, ooh
I should've listened to the
Ooh, yeah
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
Ooh
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens
Going...
(Ooh, ooh)
Sometimes you could hear a pin drop or the ticking of the clock
Between the surface conversation, no matter what they were saying
They never talked
Sometimes I would hear 'em screaming, when they thought that I was sleeping
They'd just fight about whatever, I don't know if they ever had a reason
Am I the product of a problem that I couldn't change?
Got his eyes, got her hair
So do I get their mistakes?
I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke
Sometimes I hear myself saying hand-me-down words
It's so easy to forget that he ain't him and I ain't her
And when I think the fighting has to end in a goodbye,
I wanna prove me wrong, but I'm scared I'll prove me right, 'cause
I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke
Oh, no
Will I be better, find forever, be the one to shake the habit,
Break away from broken things, and rise above the ashes?
I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
No, I ain't gonna choke
On that secondhand smoke
Oh
I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?
And tell me are you trynna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love ain't afraid to break
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah
I'll calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine
Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
'Cause boy I've got to mark it
Ooh
So they can all back off
Yeah
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah
If you you've got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
If you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah, I'm calling dibs
If you've got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey, if you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break
Hey, if you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll whatever it is you've got to give

On your heart
All mine

On your lips

On your hand
On your heart
All mine, yeah

I'm just trynna make you mine, boy
Ooh
Dibs
Go ahead and say what you're gonna say
Give it to me straight, don't sugarcoat it
Go ahead and do what you're gonna do
We're already done, I already know it
So you can take your new blonde out to get your drink on
For everyone to see
But you don't get to get to me
I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos
So I ain't staying down, tonight I'm going out
Yeah, even if I have to fake it
A little black dress to cover my mess
So you won't know my heart is breaking
Pull myself together from the fallout of forever
For everyone to see
No, you don't get to get to me
I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos
Yeah, I wear my pain like stilettos
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos
I wear my pain like stilettos
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Yeah
Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the same
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy
Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight, yeah
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
Young,
All we ever think about is fun
All we ever wanna be is 21
Hey, doesn't everyone wanna sit on top of the world?
Revolves around athletic boys and girls
Dressed up in their older sister's clothes, R. Kelly on the radio
Screaming out, "This'll never get old"
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage
Time,
Feels like it's always on our side
So we fill it up with midnight drives and lies
To your mama when she asks you where you've been
And you hide your smile and say anywhere but with him
'Cause you know when she was seventeen
She was doing the same damn thing
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage
Every light is saying "go"
When you don't know what you don't know
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
The kind of days that are "those were the days"
Underage
Underage
Young,
All we ever think about is fun
Doesn't everyone?
I don't wanna be another skeleton in your closet
Another rose that you throw, 'cause you know that it ain't okay
Just a name on a stone in a row down the road forgotten
'Cause I was falling fast, now I'm just a dash between two dates
I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me
Maybe I was naive to believe you would never hurt me
But now I know why you hide in your darkest suit and shades?
You put on a show, so nobody knows your hands and your shoes are dirty
I guess you don't need a shovel to dig a grave
I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me, yeah
You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down
You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down
I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me
Hopeless, broken girl
And you just take her, break her heart
Let her rest in peace
Right there next to me
I don't wanna be another heart
I don't wanna be another heart
In your graveyard, babe
In your graveyard, hey
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted
I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted
I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
You saw me drive by your place last Friday
But don't make too much of it, it's just on my way home
I didn't see the picture that you posted in this bar
And when I pulled into the parking lot, I didn't see your car
You can tell your friends it's all on purpose
That I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But there's no intentions underneath the surface
So don't go reading anything between the lines
'Cause I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself
Yeah
So get over yourself
You think all I do is talk about us
And that the new boy I show off is only out of spite
You're so in your head about it, you can't get your heart around it
But boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself
Guess what else?
Took all your pictures down off of my shelf
And I don't care enough to hate you so I even wish you well, boy
So you can tell your friends I do it all on purpose, yeah
That I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself
Yeah
So get over yourself
'Cause I'm over you
So get over yourself
You brought them to my door
Stood there on the front porch
That was the beginning
We had those tires spinning
Down on the green grass
Outside of town
Wild and free, never slowing down
I thought I needed you like air
We burned hot, burned out, like a flame
But in my head, you'll never fade
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses
We were roses
You put one in my hair
Danced in the middle of nowhere
You and me all summer
Bright and living color
My lips were red
Your eyes were blue
And I thought I saw forever in you
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses
The seasons had to change
And like flowers they bloom and withered away
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
It was so good while it lasted
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
Like it was metal
Like it was bulletproof
I forgot to cry when I was sad
I forgot to fight when I was mad
I made the moves that others would approve
But it ain't calculated
It ain't by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah
I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have a machine heart
No, a machine heart
I kept it quiet
But know you'll hear it scream
'Cause good or bad or right or wrong
It's finally found its beat
And it ain't calculated
It ain't bother rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah
I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have a machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
I want always get it right
But hey it matches life
At least you're getting something real
I want always get it right
But hey ain't that just life?
I want it back, wanna feel
And 'cause I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, no I don't have a machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
I let you do it too
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
I let you do it too
But I don't have a machine heart
No I don't have a machine heart
In between, just a fling, in the rain
In between, in apartment and a front porch swing
In between, cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy
In between, reckless and responsibility
Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
(In between)
In between beer and a basement
In a Napa Valley vacation
In between, home, town and a neon city
In between, underestimated and overexpectated
Who I was and who I'm gonna be
Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
I know I won't
I'm half head up in the clouds
Half feet down on the ground
'Cause it ain't that simple
As a number, sitting on a page
When they say "act your age"
But you're stuck there in the middle
Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In the end, in between
In the end, in between
He's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's still wearing that red and black jersey
Waiting for the band to start up
He's still showing up twenty late, finding hearts and rules to break
Why would he wanna change when every memory still bows to him?
But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school
He's still calling that first love, first time, pretty-eyed blonde
And she's still letting it ring 'cause his ring isn't what she wants
'Cause she traded in prom queen for a big city dream
And a slate that's clean, but
Your heart just don't get it and that's why you can't forget it
'Cause you're living like you're seventeen
But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up and the world gets cruel when...
You're still living in the hallways
Where everybody stopped and stared
And cared and knew your name
'Cause this is the real world that don't know you like that
You can remember but you can't go back
To high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday when you take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school
When you're still living in...
Five years later
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He's still calling that first love, first time
And he hates he said goodbye, she went on with her life
He's still driving the same old back roads
Wondering when he got so old
Where did his life go?
Oh, but he knows
Oh, he knows
Yeah, he knows
That this ain't high school, oh, woah
And he's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's stuck in high school
But this ain't high school
Dark as midnight and lost in it
Insecure and just done with it
Love gave up, so I stop believing
That I don't know how to get through feelings
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world
The sky kept falling, but we danced in it
I was done with love, but second chance did it
You cleared the smoke and picked up the wreckage
Got to go through hell to get to heaven
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world
I thought the cold would last forever
I didn't know that there was something better
Waiting at the end of the world, the world, the world
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world
I thought it was the end of the world
I thought it was
Dark as midnight and lost in it
The sky kept falling, but we danced in it
I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary
And I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something but it sure as hell ain't butterflies
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you
They're gonna say I fell too fast
They're gonna say it's never gonna last
And before it's too late, I should just back away
Yeah, they're gonna say that
He ain't the kind to hold my hand
He ain't gonna try to understand
Nothing under the surface
He's just looking for a pretty face
But they got it all wrong
I got it all right
They say they just don't see it
But I saw it at first sight
And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love
So I could care less if I'm being careless
Might wreck me to be reckless
But I'd rather fall apart than
Love half-hearted
Yeah, maybe it's true that you know when you know
And then again maybe you don't
But when you find a diamond
You can't keep it from shining
And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love
The life of my party
He keeps my eyes starry
So I'm so sorry for not being sorry
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love
They're gonna say I fell too fast
Yeah, they're gonna say it's never gonna last
Unapologetically
It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night
Feels like the radio and your tires rolling to my drive
Then my heart stops, like a beat drop
It's a symphony when you sweet talk
Make this quiet town, feel electric, loud
When the lights going down
Every word out of your mouth
Is like music
Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I'm saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music
Before I knew your love
Even with the volume up, it was silent then
And now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth, like a violin
Everybody else is white noise
So talk to me, cause your voice
Is like music
Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I say nothing
But it's feeling something like music
I-I-I
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again just like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again
My whole heart's listening to your music
Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I say nothing
But it's feeling something like music
We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history
Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends
Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me
And that's why we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends
Oh, whoa
We were legends
Loving you baby it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends
We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own story
(Dierks Bentley)
If lonesome was money I'd be set for life
I'd be swimmin in riches instead of tears I've cried
The blues would be worth a whole lot of green
You'd never hear one complaint from me
If lonesome was money I'd be set for life
If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone
I'd always have someone here to love me and to hold
I'd leave misery's clutches and find love's embrace
This frown you see a smile would replace
If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone
How I'd like to change lonesome
To mean something happy and free
But I know that won't ever happen you see
Lonesome will always be me
Lonesome will always be me
If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still
Bottle up my tears and let the folks drink their fill
It'd be happy hour all the time seven days a week
And laughter's all you'd ever hear from me
If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still
(Dierks Bentley)
I know things haven't gone like you planned
And for that I'm partly to blame
You didn't want to fall in love not yet
'Cause you've still got so many dreams to chase
And love is a double edged sword
It lets you walk though life feeling content
But that's a feeling you say you can't afford
And you'd be better off bein lonely again
But please don't leave me
Leave me in love
Before you walk away break my heart
Let me give you up
If you need your freedom
To find yourself
Release me from these chains of love
Lord knows I need your help
But please don't leave me
Don't leave me in love
You ask if you can hold me one last time
Sweetheart, you know I can't resist
You say tonight we'll fall asleep as lovers
But tomorrow we'll wake up as friends
How can I ever love somebody new
If I can't get my heart back from you
So please don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me
(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)
They come from Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabam
Way down in Texas from all over this land
Each one has a dream and a thousand different goals
But the one that they all share is that midnight radio
They're gonna be big stars in big cars and wear nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
They'll be ridin' on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
It started with a fiddler, then banjo and guitar
And Roy Acuff was its first singing star
Hank and Minnie and Mr. Monroe
We all sang with them through that radio
We were big stars in big cars and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
We were riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
This world keeps on changing for the better they say
But the more we move ahead the more I miss the old ways
Hey I don't mind the modern and as far as I can see
I'll keep trying to make the future part of history
And be a big star in a big car and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
I'll be riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
Bartenders listen when you talk
And bar stools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin' time begins
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
Outside lies a heart that's been broke
But in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believe
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
(Ryan McCord / Dierks Bentley)
I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me
All those threats I made about leavin'
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week
She handed me my walking papers
And said you're free to go
And celebrating felt in order
For I had escaped that prison of a home
But sittin' in this old tavern
Surrounded by my good timing friends
I see I'll never make it on the outside
And I'm thinkin' bout how I'm gonna break back in
Daylight found me sleepin' in my car
On the other side of her street
And the grass that used to be my front yard
Had never before looked so green
And I'm tempted to break for the front door
But I'm sure she'd sic the dogs on me
Cause it looks like she's got a new inmate
Cause there's a pickup in the drive I've never seen
I'm thinkin' about how I'm gonna break back in
There's things in my life that I've been missin'
The touch of a woman, and lovin' after dark
Come here lately, with the woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky, boys, and she don't have a heart
Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now, I'm no stranger to hurt
Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
Bartender, he don't mind he sets 'em up the same
Oh, whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
(Dierks Bentley)
I wake up every morning lonesome out of my mind
Reach across my bed what do I find
Sometimes a pillow sometimes a warm body
But they both leave me cold and feeling so empty
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin' single is gonna be the death of me
When the sun is high that's when I reach my low
And I vow to change my life and the places I go
But the sun starts sinkin and so do my big plans
And it ain't too long before a cold one's in my hand
Now if I die before I find her
Play her this song as a reminder
Of what might have been if we had met
Before I met this timely death
I couldn't find the right one right away
I couldn't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I went out I was just diggin deeper in my grave
I wondered if I was ever gonna find
The one that'd bring me piece of mind
The one on who I could set my heart free
This livin' single it's been the death of me
This livin' single it's been the death of me
(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)
Like the leaves I get restless
I just can't seem to settle down
When the autumn wind blows, it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground
Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
Why can't we ever be apart
Just when love finds me your chains they bind me
Forever shackled to your heart
Lonesome why do you love me
Rain ain't fallin' on my windshield
But there's tears in my rearview
Nature's dyin' I know behind she's cryin
Why do we leave them sad and blue
You won't leave me
Why do you love me
You won't let me be won't set me free
Lonesome why do you love me
(Jason Carter / Scott Boyd / Dierks Bentley)
It's dark outside my window and cold without you near
I keep thinkin' back on the times when you were mine
But rings and dreams don't matter 'cause I know you're with him tonight
And you've already left without a fight
What can I do to make you believe my love is true
What can I say to keep you from walkin' away
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you
The dawn will bring a new day and I suppose the sun will shine
But it won't bring back the light in my life
'Cause I'm afraid I've waited too long to tell you how I feel
It's sad to think I lost you 'cause I couldn't lose my pride
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you
(Mark Ward)
Called you up about an hour ago
No one answered guess you weren't home
Since you left I've had a lot of time to think
Been a month of Mondays since I took a drink
Poured what I had stashed down the kitchen sink
Bein angry it ain't no way to live
Takin' more than I'll ever give
I only wish this pain would go away
Cause home is where the hurt is
Still tryin' to find myself
Stuck here in the middle of lonesome
Wishin I was somewhere else
And this achin heart wasn't filled with bitterness
So alone
Cause home is where the hurt is
Silence he ain't a stranger now
I've come to know him well somehow
Too often dreams echo with the shadows
All I know is I need a friend
Waitin on the bitter end
Bein angry ain't no way to be
Can you believe what's become of me
And all I want is to feel your skin again
Home, Home
Home is where the hurt is
I'm so alone
Home is where the hurt is
The heart is gone
Home is where the hurt is
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...
Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'
By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?
Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...
Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'
When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was
Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'
That old picture frame keeps hangin' 'round
Cause' I ain't ready yet to take it down
But every now and then I'll slam the door
Shake it loose and she'll hit the floor
But I can't throw a good thing away
I wish it would break
I swear my trucks got a haunted radio
Cause' I hear you in every song
But I know what the silence makes me do
So I keep givin' those buttons more abuse
I wonder how much punchin' it can take
I wish it would break
Then I could move on right on
Down the line
Where I don't see you need you
In my life
But you're wrapped around me
Your memory's bound me like a chain
I wish it would break
And this old heart of mine's got a mind of its own
And it's decided not to let you go
Even though your love's no longer here
It won't let me shed one tear
Cause' it's still holdin' onto yesterday
I wish it would break
I wish it would break
I wish it would break
Go on and break
I'm gonna build a fire in the middle of July
Burn your pictures and go for a drive
Down to the river watch the ink from your love letters fade
Come back home and turn that old mattress over
Pour out the whiskey, try wakin' up sober
Gonna change it all tonight, gonna do whatever it takes
Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a-thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about you
I heard that old Jones song just the other day
'Bout a man who took a broken heart to his grave
But I'll be damned if a memory's gonna lay me down
I might be walkin' around with a head full of air
Actin' kinda crazy but I don't care
A heart barely beatin' but I'll still be above the ground
Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a-thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about you
'Cause I've lost sleep and I've lost years
And there ain't no tellin' how many tears
My mind's gonna be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about, I'll forget about you
I'll forget about you
Pullin' into the fast lane on the leavin' side of town
Just me and the dreams I've left undone
There's a lot of roads I can point this Chevy down
But I can only think of one
On this river of concrete slab a man could drive for days
And let his imagination run
There's time for a million memories along the way
But I can only think of one, oh, I can only think of one
Summer down in Galveston, underneath the stars
A fire burnin' on the sand, ragin' in our hearts
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only, I can only think of one
I'm not gonna back 'til I'm back to where you are
To undo the damage that's been done
There may be a hundred ways to mend this broken heart
But I can only think of one, oh, I can only think of one 
Summer down in Galveston, underneath the stars
A fire burnin' on the sand, and you back in my arms
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only, I can only think of one
I learned how to write it when I first started school,
Some bully didn't like it, he said it didn't sound to cool,
So I had to hit him and all I said when the blood came,
It's my last name
Grandpa took it off to Europe to fight the Germans in the war,
It came back on some dogtags nobody wears no more,
It's written on a headstone in the field where he was slain,
It's my last name
Passed down from generations too far back to trace,
I can see all my relations when I look into my face,
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame,
It's my last name
Daddy always told me far back as I recall,
Son, your part of somethin', you represent us all,
So keep it how you got it, as solid as it came,
It's my last name
Passed down from generations too far back to trace,
I can see all my relations when I look into my face,
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame,
It's my last name
So darlin' if you're wonderin' why I've got you here tonight,
I wanna be your husband, I want you to be my wife,
I ain't got much to give you but what I got means everything,
It's my last name, oh, It's my last name
I learned how to write it when I first started school

Midnight stoplight, happens every time
Pretty girl in a car
No resemblance whatsoever
I wonder how you are
Constant question poundin' in my brain
Is anybody loving you these days
Lonesome pillow, sun comes yellow
I reach across the bed
Should be hurried, workin', worries
I lie there instead
With the thought that's drivin' me insane
Is anybody loving you these days
Damn this small town, every place that I go
I drive by your house, I see his car and I know
He's there with you, but when he kisses you
Think about the memories we made, and tell me
Is anybody loving you these days
Second chances, backward glances
Most people just say no
World keeps turnin', heart keeps yearnin'
I keep holdin' the hope
One day you might answer with my name
Is anybody loving you these days
Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Down every highway of your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go
So close the door, turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you
If you should go so far, that you cannot get back
Girl, you may not remember, but my heart will not lose track
So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh, follow you
My love will follow you
It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doin'
How I'm holdin' up
Since you did me wrong
Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Gettin' ride every night
With every single ever-lovin' girl in sight, so
Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause'
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-lovin' eyes off me so
Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well I don't know what you were thinkin'
Runnin' round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree... so
How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
Cause' you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losin' my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me
Yeah how are you doin', now that you know
How I'm doin' since you did
What you done to me
Every day I swim an ocean fightin' your memory like endless waves
I've surrendered to the truth, I'll always love you but I know someday
I'm gonna reach the banks of a distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore
Once in a while I'll ride the river of whiskey wishes from an old shot glass
But the way it used to be, follows me downstream, so I keep knockin' 'em back
Till I reach the distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore
Someday I'm gonna get there
It might take my last prayer
But one these days I'm gonna cross that ocean, some sweet angel will set me free
And they'll tell my story, sing a song about glory, and read Psalms 23
When I reach the banks of that distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore
Gonna rest my soul in the hands of the Lord
Where I won't miss you anymore
Designer names and diamond rings
Are just some of the finer things
I thought it took to keep her satisfied
But a bank account and credit cards
A circle drive through an acre yard
Couldn't fill that lonesome feelin'
That she held inside
I bought her fancy clothes for all occasions
And that new car so she could go
Just any old where she pleased
I bought that golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Leavin' early and stayin' out late
I thought for sure her love would wait
Until the day that I could find the time
But all the things that she expected
Were all the things that I neglected
For what she wanted most from me
Would not have cost a dime
I bought her fancy clothes for all occasions
And that new car so she could go
Just any old where she pleased
I bought that golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
I bought the golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Yes, I bought those shoes that just walked out on me
There's things in my life that I've been missin'
The touch of a woman, and lovin' after dark
Come here lately, with the woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky, boys, and she don't have a heart
Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now, I'm no stranger to hurt
Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
Bartender, he don't mind he sets 'em up the same
Oh, whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name
Every time I hear the whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive comin' down the line
It carries my mind away to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly
Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Box-carrin' like a hobo, it must have been rough
But a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to be free
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey here rattlin' at the door
Railroad man lookin' for me I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize it's just another dream
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
Yeah, There you go again train travelin'
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
Oh, but there you go again train travelin'
Yeah, There you go again train travelin' 
There you go again train travelin'
These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
I've got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two
But I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
Yeah, I still got a leavin' left to do
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby,
I feel like layin' you down
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away
So come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go
If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
Till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day
Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Back to the basics of you and me
What makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Come a little closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
Cracked windshield
Crumpled up cans and a beat up bag of red man chew
Fix a flat, jonny cash box set
Half a dozen parking ickets that I ain't paid yet
Litten on that long bed seat
I got my shot gun girl right next to me
Four wheel turnin'
Two hearts burnin
We go runnin' wild
Gonna make a million
Memories for every hundred
Thousand miles
Learnin everything I'll ever need
To know about life and love
In the cab of my truck
Sliden rear
Back window
So it's an easy reach to where my cooler keeps 'em iced down cold
Roll of duck tape, W D 40
Ain't nothin' too loose or licked too tight for a man like me
Yeah, I might take it slow
30 through town
On a back dirt road
Girl I put the hammer down
Down by the river, two bodies in the glow of the radio dial
Gonna make a million memories for every hundred thousand miles
I'm learnin everything we'll ever need to know about life and love
In the cab of my truck
In the cab of my truck
Man I can't find anything in this truck
Oh, what's this? a little white tank top
Get out of my way Cadilac, big white's comin' through
I must look just like a fool
Here in the middle of the road
Standin' there in your rearview
Gettin' soaked to the bone
This land as flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still paryin' I might see
The glow of the brake light
But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
I held on longer than I should
Believin' you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time
But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot, on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes, baby just one time
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slowdown
I'd settle for a slowdown
Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me, so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best.
I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister, or Cuervo Gold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.
Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.
No, I wasn't cheatin'. She just said that I was hard to please.
And I'll admit it: I can be set in my country ways.
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.
Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.
You've got beer from all over the world on the wall.
I can even get a free t-shirt, if I try them all.
But tonight I'm in the mood for some of that home-grown brew!
Yeah, pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, hey I know what the best is.
Anything domestic, light, and cold!
The world is cold but I don't care, when you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound, and good things happen when you're Around
I work hard for not much pay, so I can know that you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds, and good things happen when you're Around
So won't you wait for me, I'll be home soon
Wait for me, I'll only be a day or two
(Musical interlude)
Won't you wait for me, I'll be home soon
Yeah, Wait for me, I'll only be a day or two
The world is cold but I don't care, when you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound, and good things happen when you're around
I work hard for not much pay, so I can know that you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds, and good things happen when you're around
Good things happen when you're around
Guess you heard I'm doin' well
Struck it rich, to hear some folks tell
But I'm still the same old me
Down on Easy Street
You give your all to find that road
And you lose touch with some people as you go
Promises are hard to keep
Down on Easy Street
But when I lay down, and you're not there
Girl, I wish I was anywhere, but
In this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
Up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on Easy Street
Someone told me you moved on
Well who could blame you, with me so off and gone
But do you ever think of me
Down on Easy Street
If you're out this way, some week, some year
Girl, you'll still find me waitin' here
(Repeat Chorus Twice)
Down on Easy Street
Down on Easy Street
Guess you heard I'm doin' well
I don't wanna rush this thing
I don't wanna jump the gun
I really wanna say those three little words
But I'm gonna bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too?
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wantin' me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
Feelin' it too
Oh, yeah
I prefer the fiddle to the violin
And I tend to think that supermodels are too thin
And I think who you are is who you oughtta be
But that's just me
The best of Andy Griffith was in black and white
Fishin' still beats workin' if you never get a bite
And coffee's kinda pointless without caffeine
But that's just me
And I believe in little that I hear and only half of what I see
And I believe that living by the book is harder than it used to be
And I'm convinced that lovin' you
Is gonna be the secret to my longevity
But that's just me
I've never seen a place that I like more than home
When I go to the movies, I don't take a telephone
And I'll buy the gas, but you oughtta get the air for free
But that's just me
I've never been to Mars, but I'm a man
And I accept the fact that women are just hard to understand
I think people take themselves too seriously
But that's just me
Hey, that's just me
That's just me
You're the last thing that I cling to
Before I fall asleep at night
You're the first thing that I reach for
In the early mornin' light
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could've been more like
Your memory and kept hangin' around
You're that tap on my shoulder
You're that voice in the crowd
You're that constant distraction
You're that book I can't put down
It keeps haunting me, I still want and need you, always will
You're every thought I think, every sight I see
Every feelin' I feel
You're the last thing that I wish for
When I lay down at night
Well, we know it ain't the first time
We know it used to be my past time
And a couple of weeks back we agreed
That was gonna be my last time
But I guess that night I plumb forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker
No, there ain't no need to stay mad
No need to waste a whole day mad
Thought I have to admit, honey, you
Look pretty darn cute mad
Oh baby, workin' this out can't be that hard
I said I'm gonna be in charge?
Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker
Oh, burn it down now
Yeah, I guess last night I plumb forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker
Yeah, let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker
Ah, I'm sorry about that baby
I remember lookin' up to look up to him.
An' I remember, most the time he wasn't there.
I'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night.
He'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair. 
An' I'd say: "Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me." 
He stumbled in the gym on graduation day.
An' I couldn't help but feel so ashamed.
An' I wasn't surprised a bit when he didn't stay,
He stumbled out before they called my name. 
An' I thought:"Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
It's not just me who's watching,
You've caught everybody's eye.
And you're trippin' an' stumblin',
And even though I've turned eighteen,
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're still leading me." 
The old man's still like he always was,
But I love him anyway.
If I've learned one thing from him,
It's my kids will never have to say: 
"Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me." 
"Yeah, walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me."
Well, here we are again
Me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy
He's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells. "Where we gonna go?"
Oh, you'd think by now he'd know
Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are
Pile three in my truck
The rest follow us, and we'll head downtown
Ah, y'all know the drill, hit Jack and Jill's
Then the Cavalier Lounge
Jimmy, you run in and look around
And we'll know if you don't come out, that's
Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are
If we gotta cross the county line
Oh, you can bet we're gonna find
Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are
Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are
Where the girls
Where the girls
Whoo, I think we done hit the goldmine
Billy Currington - Time with you
Daily time is stealin me away again
But I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now is
Time with you
More time with you
To laugh and talk and play
And to make more love to you...
Oh there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you... ooh
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolvin around us
We'd still be there and forever
If the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough
I'm gone for now
To do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live for you
Like a summer breeze floatin' cross the water
Softer than a whisper on my skin
I can't begin to tell you how it moves me
It's so intense, I burn within
When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me
She walks across the room just like an angel
And I get that funny feeling deep inside
Pulls up a chair and sits down at the table
I come to life, oh, there's nothin' like
When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me
Oh, no one has ever touched me like this
Set me on fire with just one sweet gentle kiss
Amazing, that's what is is
When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me
Anywhere close to me
When she gets close to me
The red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain
Sure made for one nasty mess
Ah, but we were ridin' high in that old truck of mine
In deep as we could get
Always looking for a rut, tryin' not to get stuck
And slinging that mud everywhere, growin' up down there
Me and my friends where the deep river bends
Had a long rope tied to a tree
Takin' turns on the swing, takin' turns takin' drinks
And I don't mean iced tea
A good buzz later playing chicken with the gators
Way too young to be scared, growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there
We'll, nothin' going on never lasted too long
We were good at makin' good times
Find a field, spread the word, keep a bonfire burnin'
Through both ends of the night
Had the radio up, had a keg in the truck
And tryin' to get lucky somewhere
Growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there
Yeah, lookin' back now, man, it don't seem fair
If you didn't get to do your growin' up down there
So, there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
I'll break my grip, but babe, you need to know
Next time I might not let you go
I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go
Good thing I don't get paid to think
'Cause I sure thought I had the strength
To fight love off, but my resistance is runnin' low
And next time I might not let you go
I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go
Yeah, next time I just might
Hold on for dear life
Yeah, next time I just might not let you go
Next time I might not let you go
So, there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
And a city boy stole my sweet girl
I used to know everybody by name
Everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay
This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
I thought like my dad and his daddy before
That I would die where I was born
Live in a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies and corn
Now here I am, one eye on the road
Tryin' to read the map on the dash
Nowhere close to making up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast
This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
City folks got worries,
A country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I get finished plowin'
I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity
I'm gonna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I wanna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
Subdivisions are silly
I wanna be a hillbilly.
I was sittin' there, sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the interstate
Needin' directions, and I was the man for the job
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate, but a right
Will bring you right back here to me
I was sittin' at thinkin' 'bout her pretty face
Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
I threw my hat and thought you fool, it could've been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right
Will bring ya right back here to me
Is this Georgia heat, playin' tricks on me
Or am I really seein' what I think I see
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why but somethin' felt right
You gotta stop in and asked Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent 'er right back here to me
Thank God, for good directions, and turnip greens
A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you gotta take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong
Must be doin' something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face
Must be doin' something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Oh, baby
Mmm...
I don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right, oh yeah
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right
Mmm...
Don't know what I did
Oh...
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right
I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one-woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now
I remember you used to like
Walkin' with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now
Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?
You might start missin'
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now
I said, "I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston"
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pullin' up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinkin', "Who am I kiddin'?"
I ain't goin' nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That changes everything
Ah, yeah
That changes everything
Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around 1 am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be all right
'Cause she said
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Now it didn't take me a second till I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said "Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two."
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says,
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby, baby just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No, no, no, no
Not tonight, now baby
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby, baby, baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
So come on baby
Said, "I'll be there in a minute or two."
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a gentle touch, but more than enough
She can stop this ole world from spinnin' too much
It's a natural thing and I do believe
I found my reason to be
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
I'm not the same man since she's been around
There's more to this life, I've suddenly found
I look at myself now so differently
It's her love that brings me peace
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
Whatever it is, I'll always be under her spell
She'll always be all I'll ever need
I could search the whole world
And I know I'd never find
Someone perfect as her for me
Suddenly it's something
You just can't live without
Oh, you know you found love
Beyond any doubt
With a simple man's words
I can never convey all that I feel when I say
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
(She's got a way with me)
In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot,
On a barstool she took off her ring.
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over.
I sat down and asked her her name.
When the drinks finally hit her,
She said," I'm no quitter,
But I finally quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter,
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings."
In the mirror I saw him,
And I closely watched him.
I thought how he looked out of place.
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me.
He had a strange look on his face.
The big hands were calloused,
He looked like a mountain,
For a minute I thought I was dead.
But he started shaking,
His big heart was breaking,
He turned to the woman and said,
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey.
I thought how she'd made him look small.
From the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all.
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind.
I couldn't hold her, for the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time.
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.
"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.
Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
Ain't no movie, ain't no bar
Ain't nothin' out there beats where we are
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We've been workin' so hard, had no breaks
Gotta lotta overdue love to make
If we get no sleep, well that's okay
'Bout time me and you and me got this way
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Well, come on baby, we can't stop now
No givin' in till we both give out
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We're just getting' started, ain't this fun
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Yeah, there's a whole lot more where that came from
Oh yeah
Walks in the rain, talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hangin' with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin' around yard sale to yard sale
Droppin' by the county fair, winnin' you a bear poppin' balloons
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am
December nights all cuddled up
Warmed by the fire and sharin' a cup
Of hot cocoa laughin' at old photos
Spanish guitars, sand and the sea
A quiet little table just you and me
Sippin' margaritas in a little cantina in Old Mexico
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am
Talkin' 'bout life and talkin' 'bout babies
Talkin' 'bout us still in love when we're eighty
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am
Here I am
Baby, here I am
She don't cook, she don't clean
She ain't never found the knob on the washin' machine
She don't iron, she don't sew
Says why waste time, foldin' clothes
She ain't never gonna get Mama's recipe right
But she knows what to do with a Saturday night
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
She makes a mean margarita and a Singapore Sling
And if y'all are into Skynard, she sure can sing
She's gonna run the table, if you let her break
She might pop out of the top of a birthday cake
And that little black dress painted on tight
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
We get home in the early a.m.
That's when all the real fun begins
Yeah, she holds me close and whispers in my ear
Every little sweet thing I want to hear
Then she lights them candles and out go the lights
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Yeah, they call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Saturday night
With a Saturday night
Saturday night
(Feat. Brett Beavers, Jim Beavers)
I only slept for a couple of hours
In the back of my buddy's truck
I must be runnin' on solar power
'Cause I'm ready to crank back up
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
There's a hole in my beach towel
There's a hole in the atmosphere
But we got the shade of the lifeguard tower
Yeah, that's where we keep the beer
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine
Yeah I know Monday always comes again
So I just wanna soak it in
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby's into lockin' in a Coppertone tan
So I'm so emotional she did with both of my hands
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da da
Swimmin' in sunshine
(Billy Currington, Tony Martin, Mark Nesler)
Well I never thought that I'd be where I'm at
At this point in my life looking back
My old heart's been broken more than I can count
And my plans aren't going like I've worked 'em out
I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of
Well I posed my questions and got no reply
Maybe God's just saying why ask why
And I think how boring this old life would be if we had the answers to everything
I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of
That's the beauty of it
If I don't solve nothing
I can try again
Another day is coming I should be on to something really good by then
I think I might just stay up late gazing up at the stars above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of
I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate life and love and the meaning of
(Billy Currington, Tony Martin, Mark Nesler)
Every reason not to go
I don't think you'll like it
I hear that city's cold
And the people are much warmer
Two good reasons not to go
You fight traffic all day long
Then you gotta pay to park
You have to go around locking all your doors there after dark
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
Their football team is lousy
No matter what they do
You can bet come Sunday they'll find a way to lose
You'll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
Got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
There must be something in this town
You'd be missing if you move
'Cause I know if you weren't around I'd be missing you
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
I'm in love with you
And baby now you know every reason not to go
Don't you hate hearing that clock on the wall chimming saying its time and
Don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime if we crawled back into bed got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is going
Baby, b'aby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
If you gotta go you gotta know I might go crazy
Here without you baby
Reliving every kiss, you ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right and wait until tonight to light another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning
Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
No, No one else can love me like you do
You know I ain't even close to through
Loving you...
Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
"God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy"
He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damn if I know"
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page Obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
The way you stumble in the kitchen
Looking for that first cup of joe
How you put on your mascara
Starin' in the mirror on your tippy-toes
And if you wonder why I love you baby
I can boil it down to just one thing
Yeah everything
Every little thing about you baby turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
I can't explain
How everything about you turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
Oh it turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
The sexy way you say "Hey baby"
When you see my number on your phone
The way you bit your lip when Mama said
"You cooked the chicken way too long"
Girl be careful what you do and say
The way you walk, the way you smile
The way you kiss, it drives me wild
The way you laugh, the way you sing
Girl you know it's everything
The way you talk, the way you drive
The way you make me feel alive
The way you whisper "I love you"
Everything you do just turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
(Ashley Gorley, Bryan Simpson, Wade Kirby)
You're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful
Wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I know I've seen you somewhere before
In my mind behind door number 3
You're a pray you're a gift from god
But there's a bridge I cannot cross
It seems your distant dream
I will never hold you
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I put one foot in front of another
I walk on
Knowing there will never be another
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I wanna beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I walk on
(Billy Currington, Brett Jones)
Sometimes they look brown
Sometimes they look blue
Always they offer a beautiful view
Into the soul I'm connected to
No one has eyes like you
They dance in the light
They sing in the dark
They pull me together
They tear me apart
I'm jealous of paper when you read the news
Oh no one has eyes like you
They hold me, they know me
Like no one will ever know me
They fly me
They land me
Most of all they understand me
They shout hallelujah when you whisper my name
Patiently listen to whatever I say
They playful and funny
And passionate too
No one has eyes like you
They hold me, and they know me
Like no one will ever know me
And They fly me
And They land me
Most of all they understand me
They smile when I'm happy
They cry when I'm sad
They make me out to be more than I am
Oh no one loves me more than you do
And no one has eyes like you
Oh no one has eyes baby like you
I got the chrome all shined up.
Look how the moon just climbed up.
Who knows where we'll wind up, ooh.
A finger hangin' on your belt look,
Finger flippin' for the right tune.
You know how bad I want you, ooh.
Oh, I hope that you likin' how I handle the curves.
I can't think straight and I'm startin' to swerve so...
Let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.
We don't need a drop of gasoline,
Settin' off sparks in the passenger seat.
You can write your name in the window steam, ooh.
We can hit a hundred standin' still,
Barely hangin' on on the top of a hill.
Slidin' on the hood, kickin' off your heels, ooh.
Come on let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.
Well we still got time fore the moon runs
Out to find what these hearts are beatin' about so...
Let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.
Tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.

You've been lookin' over here all night
And When I look, you look away

Like you didn't mean to drive me crazy
Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile, has got me spinnin' around

Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin' baby don't ya, don't ya
It happened on a Sunday,
Outside and the sun was shinning.
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside.
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words,
But they were so hard to find.
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us
I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I kissed your tears all falling down
Said baby, you'll always be the one
Aw baby I'm never going to turn around
Your all the life I have in these lungs
We can all be scared to death
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us
I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mamas house
We were so in love, finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees,
Said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the isle,
I remember it now,
I remember your smile
I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
Yaaaaaaa
Ill bring you back to love
Ill bring you back to love
People say I'm a little shy and I keep to myself
(Oh well)
I ain't much for small talking
Don't wanna waste my breath
Everything we've been saying has already been said,
Politics and weather well I'm out
But when someone brings you up, there ain't no shuttin my mouth
I go on and on talkin' 'bout you baby
All day long, your name it just rolls so easy off my tongue
That I can't help but go on and on and on and on and on
Those baby blues and the way you move have got me losin my mind
Just can't help myself don't wanna talk about nothin' else
The only conversation we're conversating about
When once you get me going there ain't no slowin me down
I go on and on talkin' 'bout you baby
All day long, your name it just rolls so easy off my tongue
That I can't help but go on and on and on and on and on
(On and on)
Well I ain't gonna tell you I know everything
But I don't want things so let me do my thing
And go on and on talking 'bout you baby
All day long your name it just rolls so easy off my tongue
That I can't help but go on and on and on and on
You turn me on and on and on and on and on
On and on
On and on
And on about you baby
All day long
On and on
Oh, put me on a train
Put me on a one-way runway sky-high aeroplane
Oh girl, I really need a change, get away, see the smile on your face
And find me a row boat, let it flow, on a river pointed your way,
I'm thinking let's be spontaneous
All I'm saying is...
It's a long way from here to California and I
Must say I need you around and I'm
Not afraid to meet you in the middle of a
Nowhere anybody's heard of town in a
Little cabin up in the mountains or a
Cabana on a beach somewhere
All I know is you're not here
And all that means is I've gotta get there
Yeah, I gotta gotta get there, I gotta get there
Come on and hold me in your arms
Cause for a long while these miles been keeping me from where you are
Girl I need a little sweet talk, long walk, strolling down the boulevard
Aw, can't you hear the "miss you" in my voice?
Oh, no more waitin', let's be spontaneous
All I'm saying is...
It's a long way from here to California and I
Must say I need you around and I'm
Not afraid to meet you in the middle of a
Nowhere anybody's heard of town in a
Little cabin up in the mountains or a
Cabana on a beach somewhere
All I know is you're not here
And all that means is I've gotta get there
Oh, I'm on my way right now
Oh, no more waitin', let's be spontaneous
All I'm saying is...
It's a long way from here to Alabama and I
Must say I need you around and I'm
Not afraid to meet you in the middle of a
Nowhere anybody's heard of town in a
Little cabin up in the mountains or a
Cabana on a beach somewhere
All I know is you're not here

Yeah, I gotta gotta get there, I gotta get there
Yeah, I gotta get there, I gotta get there, yeah
Yeah, I gotta gotta get there, I gotta get there, yeah
One Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi
Lipstick on the coffee cup
I know I should wash it up
But maybe I'll just wait here for a little while
I run my fingers around the top
Where your lips were I just stop
'Cause I, I can almost see your smile
And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
And I know everybody's got their demons
Everybody's got their reasons
Why they leave when they run
Oh but baby I could have helped you through it
You built a wall and I couldn't get to it
Now I'm waiting for the rain, and the pain to come
And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi
Oh one Mississippi yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh
Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance
Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey
Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music
I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause
You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to beat of the music
Beat of the music
I got my hands in my pockets 'cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore
I was so foolish thinkin' you'd be
Happy just sittin' round waitin' on me
It really put me in my place
When you closed the door in my face
And I
I sure spent a lot of time
All makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long
I could beg, I could cry but it won't change the circumstance
Cause the truth is I should've pulled the trigger when I had the chance
I was looking for something I already had
When I came back for it it was somebody else's
You used to give me all your lovin'
But now you say you've had enough
And I
I sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long
Oh waited, I waited
I got my hands in my pockets 'cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore
And I
Sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
And once I finally figured out where I belong
Yeah once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah I guess I waited too long
Waited, waited
Oh waited, waited too long
If I could be the reason your hair's a mess,
The bass drum beatin' way down deep in your chest,
If I could be the voice on your radio,
Then I could be your long ride home.
If mine could be the name that changes yours,
The wine in your glass,
The swing on your porch,
The dollar in your pocket,
And the peaceful in your sleep,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
If I could be the fire in your firefly,
The cool in the rain,
The spark in your eye,
The answer to your prayer,
And the faith that sets you free,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me,
What you mean to me
And oh,
All of this talkin' makes you laugh,
But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Yeah,
Falling's how you feel,
And perfect's what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Be what you mean to me.
Oh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean, what you mean to me.

Katherine Davis, room 303
Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee everyday
She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me
She talks about clothes on the line in the summer air
Christmas morning and Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family that I never had
Well, sometimes I find myself wishing I'd been there
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me
There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis '71
Until she can see his face again
I'm gonna fill in the best I can
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me
And she calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me
Every man has his place in time 
Everyone has a loved one that they leave behind 
And even though I'm not right there with you 
I'm watchin' from a distance, just wishin' that you knew 
I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 
I hope that it's my love that makes you feel 
That you can get back on your feet, yeah I swear you will 
Oh you got so much of this life left to live 
And I'll be smilin' at the thought of you, just like I always did 
I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 
Without me 
Without me 
Yeah 
I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 
Every breath of life is short and sweet 
So glad that I'm up here, that I got to see 
You g-o-o o-o-on without me
You look good in the palm of my hands
Watch the light round your feet just dance
Feel your sweat pressed against my skin
Girl you're fire, you're fire
Take the breath right out of my chest
Burn me down till there ain't nothing left
Keep on doing what you do best
Girl you're fire, you're fire
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
Bring the heat
You're like a mess lying across that floor
Every step makes me want you more
Oh and you thought I wanted you before
Well girl you're fire, you're fire
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, oh
Ridin' those eyes covered in smoke
Face is red as a dirty joke
Shakin' those hips, lickin' those lips
Doin' what you do to get the whole room lit
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
Yeah
Wall to wall, it's packed
Give your hands a smack
Polish up my watch 
VIP is in the back
Hear the beat of the music playing
Rat pack, hi-hat swaying
I'll blaze it up and braise it
I'm saying
Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
Oh no, the goose is loose
Just feeling up this groove
Don't it feel nice
Burning up these lights
Those green eyes, I've been watching
Got me all caught up and
The way your hips are talking
I can't stop it
Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
Bring the heat back
I could party with you, you could party with me
If you party with us, then you better believe
That the lights are up in this town
But they're about, about to go down
And it's about midnight
Oh, and I think she might
Told her to spin around, all around this town
Feels like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, girl, so I'm the one to blame, oh
You... make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show me that apple, girl, and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get out of this straitjacket
You... make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my...
I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you, yeah
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is I always have to guess (you know I do)
You... you make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and a true spear
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of that moon
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home
Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna
When you're searching the horizon
When you're eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh, I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh.
I've been racing, chasing, caught up in the grind
Damn near going out of my mind
And it's getting old real fast
I need a new time zone, zip code, point of view
A southbound window seat into (come fly with me)
A drunken rum-soaked crowd
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
I got all I need
Floating on the breeze in Staniel Cay
The pounding in my head's starting to ease
From the magic in this glass
Yeah, that's the way it works down here
Things turn around real fast
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
You can get a little loud
We can get a little hard to find
Give a little bit of love
We'll mix it with a bit of sunshine
Mix it up
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
You gotta waste a little time in your life once in a while
Come on everybody
Ah, here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
Fill 'er up again
It's time well spent, it's time well spent
It's time well spent, it's time well spent
You light up every street light
You stop every heart when you start that smile
But somehow you're still lonely
Oh let me show you why you're the only one I wanna give my heart to
If you give me the chance, oh I'll show you it's alright
Oh watch your life
To pick you up, I'd lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah, if you were my girl
If you were my girl
You wouldn't be staring at the ceiling
With a half broke heart wondering if that feeling is ever
Going to fade away
I'd change all that if you let me today
'Cause I've never wanted anything
The way I want you next to me
For all my life
Come on let's ride
I'll pick you up, I'll lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah, if you were my girl
If you were my girl
For the first time maybe ever, who am I kidding
Girl I've never felt the way I feel, oh it's so real
Let me pick you up, and lay you down
Hold you 'til you come unwound
I'll make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
If you were my girl
If you were my girl
If you were, if you were my girl
If you were my girl
Oh if you were, if you were my girl
If you were, if you were my girl
I come from the heart of the Heartland
Where pictures shows where the corn grows
In rows and rows of summer greens
And winter snows
And it goes on
Through the crack of the bat
Oh everybody rollin' out there welcome mat
And our hands on our hearts under the stars of the Friday night flag
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois
I remember the first time 
I saw that name on the marquee sign
Lights so bright could almost make you blind
I'd get lost in
Sweet girls singin' along
Buses rollin' on in the silver dawn
Seein' the world a long long way from home
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh...
It's water through my blood
It's the place I got my roots
It's the fire that's in my soul
It's the mud that's on my boots
Ooh Illinois...
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise 
Like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois
All I can do is try to drink you in
And do my best
To soak up all that sugar from your skin
But then you had to go and kiss me
You made me fall a little bit harder in this age
You gonna have to miss me
Oh, what do you got to do that for your lips
Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Just a taste
I'd love to run my fingers through your head
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I need it
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips
Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Now all I do
Is think about you all the time
But let me show you
That you never felt a love like mine
No you never felt a love like mine
All you left me was
Your lips pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste, yeah
Just a taste, yeah
Back in my mind all the time
Just a taste
So good on that sugar from your skin
Oh, I gotta drink you in
Oh, let me drink you in
Just a taste
The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh 'cause I kind of like feeling this way
I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love
It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do, just laying here with you all day
I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love
Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song
I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
Still drunk on your love
Yeah, yeah
I'm so drunk
First you gotta learn how not to listen
When she opens up her heart
Try your best to make it all about you
That's the easy part
Take all your promises, and break 'em
Stay out late, and come home high
And by this time you're on your way
It's gonna be over any day
And if you've really tried
You won't have to wonder why
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all
Let the walls fall down around you
Let the bills and the dishes stack up to the sky
Make friends with regret
And try your damnedest to forget
And you bet, you never will
Oh I swear, you never will
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all
You lose it all
Take all your promises, and break 'em
I got a shadow and it follows me around
Wherever I go, it moves without a sound
My alter ego, that hunts me down and gets me
Finds a way to trick me
Then drowns me in the whiskey
Hold up, I need some help
The more you feed the beast, the more he raises hell
I know, I got a problem
But you know what they say
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no
Find me a preacher, I'm down on my knees
I need a leader to break these chains off of me
Don't let 'em hurt me, I'm getting kind of worried
Vision's getting blurry, please, somebody hurry
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no
Pretty little angel, whisper in my ear
Please just make him disappear
I don't know if I can take no more
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no
Gotta wait for that sun to go down
He's following me around
But it gets worse at night
Alright, give me another drink, c'mon
I'm going away for a while
Don't care how many miles
It takes it get wherever I go
As long as I can take it slow
And take my time
Finding a brand new heart
Making a brand new start
Been watching the whole world
Fall apart and the pieces
Keep on breaking, so
If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
I'll be kicked back in the shade
Nothing but buzz in my veins
Nobody knowing my name
I'm just a face and a place
A dot on the map
And it's too short of a life
I gotta enjoy the ride
I finally get to feeling alive
I'm taking off, I'm flying
If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
And just outside this bar
There's a shop with a postcard
I'll write your name
"Wish You Were Here"
And I'll be back when things are clearer
So I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don't ever wanna move
You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in my knees
You put me right where I'm supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away
'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I'm falling to you
Over and over and over again
When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I've ever been
Everything I'll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me
When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
Sure feels good
See that girl there tapping her toes?
Nervous, crying out "Hallelujah"
She wipes her tears on the sleeve of her coat
Dries her eyes, but spills a cherry cola
I bet some guy gave her that frown
I'd love to turn it around
Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero
It's like her hands are up, out of a smoky window
Saying, "Save me from this burning building"
It's like she's cornered in a darkened alley
Helpless in a world full of villains
She's tired of running away
Here I come to save the day
Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
Oh, I'm stepping in, I'm stepping in
I'm stepping in
Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
Everybody needs a superhero
All the world needs a superhero
Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you got it all together
So if you don't, mind I'd like to know you better
Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive
Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around
Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been
Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around
Sitting at the bar, telling fairy tales
Pouring whiskey in wishing wells, feeling sorry for myself
There's only one person in this world that can save me from myself
So I pick up the phone, pray that you're home, I'm all alone
Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad
There's some jerk at the bar smoking a big fat Cuban cigar
And I wave my hands through the smoke
I think I see you, but it's some kind of twisted joke
Oh, you wouldn't be caught dead in here
Just the thought of me crying would make you disappear
Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad, so damn bad
I want a choir to sing
I'm saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad, so damn bad
Girl, you're the reason
Yeah, you're the reason
You know you're the reason
I need you so bad
Girl, you're the reason
Yeah, you're the reason
You know you're the reason
I need you so bad
I need you so bad
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at
I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at
Damn you're looker
You're the cane and the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh till I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all money on you all over this town
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at
You thought it was over
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll &amp; Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at
Hahaha...
Cut!
There's a half a million sunsets I haven't got to show you
Don't ask me how I know, but I know they steal your breath
And I can almost feel the feeling that you're gonna give me
Especially when you kiss me like no one ever has
You're so real, I can't explain it, don't keep me waiting
You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
You could be the dream that I always chased
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet
I saw two people talking in a corner booth cafe
Looking so in love thinking that could be us someday
I don't know what you're doing, I don't know where you are
But I swear, girl, when I meet you, you'll already have my heart
You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
You could be the dream that I always chased
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet
Not yet, I still haven't got to hold yet
Not yet, I'm still tossing 'round on this bed
Not yet, I want you in my arms and out of my head
You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
Wherever you are, girl, I'm on my way
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet
I guess I haven't met you yet
Oh, I haven't met you yet
I haven't met you, I haven't met you, I haven't met you
I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rockin' chair
Holdin' a beer in my hand
Sportin' a neon tan
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Don't have a clue what went down
So I started callin' around
And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I cried oh no, no
Good time Charlie got me
Now I'm broke
But it was worth actin' like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must really showed you
'Cause all my friends say

All my friends say

Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

On the bar
Workin' the crowd
Pourin' out my heart

And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid

Luke Bryan - Baby's on the Way
I ain't been doin' to right
Since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast lost at work state of mind.
We're MEETING here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff.
I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way.
I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.
Ain't gonna try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "When you fell from heaven, did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while.
Pull a few questions from my "Get to know Her Better" file.
Yeah, it's a real good day, cause baby's on the way.
I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got, got me feelin' like this.
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.
Just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again.
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in.
I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.
Homecoming parade, you were the queen
I was riding right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud
The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me
On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids, and I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me, I thought God I'm a lucky man
The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me
Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together through one more spring
Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat with tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant for wearing Sunday clothes
The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
Time is tight and money's short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh Mama, what am I gonna do
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything
Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip
And your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh Mama, what am I gonna do
She said,"Child, there's only one thing you can do"
Yeah take a walk, take a breath, oh give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple fish
And just like that toss'em back and make a little wish
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it stress about it, fret about it
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
Wide-eyed, baptized, and still wantin' to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
That's us, haulin' hay in the field with the radio on.
That's us, headin' straight into town when the work was done
In my mind, I can still see us now, ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago
We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was huntin' and fishin' and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed, in our lives
Fallin' in and out of love, we rode in trucks
That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now, ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago, it's apart of my soul, yeah
Down where I was born, was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Luke Bryan - I'll Stay Me
T-shirt, blue jeans don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut ain't no redeye gravy on a biscut.
My deep Southern drawl makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out.
Some folks aren't happy like they are.
Some wanna take things just a little too far.
Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I am just what I am, I'm just what you see.
So I'll make it easy, I'll stay me.
My granny and pawpaw still missing Hee Haw
I love my little town where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street got a kiss just waitin on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries when I go over tonight.
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touchin' her love loving, hard working man.
Quarterbacks wanna play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes, but I still believe
I'm gonna make it easy, I'll stay me.
Ridin' down the road listenin' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it,
The one I wanted you to hear.
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up till then, all I'd ever listened to was
A little "Sweet Home...," "Tuesday's Gone,"
And "Working Man Blues."
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song
Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up,
Made me more aware of somethin' deep inside
Somethin' that I have,
A life I want to share
And I'll rememebr this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words,
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on,
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on...
My first love song
Baby... (Repeat chorus)
Yeah baby
You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm
Hey I'm a country man a city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby I'm a country man
I've got a jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little i-pod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were cruising to Hank
Hey I'm a country man a city boy can't do the things I can
I can hot-wire your tractor and plow up your land
Hey baby I'm a country man
You like the ivy league hum-v tennis sweater type
But girl I'm here to tell you don't believe the high
Hey I'm a country I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey baby I'm a country man
Hey I'm a country man huntinh me a good ole'
Country girlfriend
Why don't you come and join me in my new deerstand
Hey baby I'm a country man
Hey baby I'ma country man
There's a bonfire burning.
Got Bocephus blaring louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood.
If you wanna see follow me over the river through the woods.
When the bugs and the beer start biting
There's bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumpin' up on somebodys hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods.
Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights a left then a hard right
They're goin' all night
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin' what we should.
Over the river and through the woods
At first I thought she was kiddin when she mentioned skinny dipping.
She said follow me through the trees yes siree unless I misunderstood.
We'll splash and splish with the fish over the river and through the woods.
That's my beer can next to her beer can next to my work pants up there on dry land.
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin' what we should.
Over the river and through the woods.
That's my sore head layin in my truck bed eyes blood shot red hearing what my mamma said.
But we did a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should.
Over the river and through the woods.
You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day 
Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to
You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town 
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you 'til you feel the truth
You make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to
Well I never met a girl like you
That's got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to
You make me want to
You make me want to
Luke Bryan - Tackle Box
It was two shades of brown, scratched-up plastic.
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches.
And his last name engraved in black,
Right there by the handle on the top.
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon.
Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'.
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box.
'Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific.
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship.
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus.
And watch him run to Grandma, cryin' on the dock.
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.
He'd bait my hook and keep on tellin' stories
'Bout nickel Cokes, girls, and sandlot glories.
Pickup trucks and golden fields
Long before this town knew blacktop.
I was almost ridin' with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Takin' turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Fillin' the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.
He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holdin' on to one wish
That God above could let me borrow Grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish.
And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific.
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship.
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus.
And watch him run to Grandma, cryin' on the dock.
He'd open up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.
Everything he loved he kept locked up in that old tackle box.
I was sittin' there, sellin' turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from.
She had HOLLYWOOD written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the Interstate.
Needin' directions and I was the man for the job.
I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old COKE sign.
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Then a left will take you to the Interstate,
But a right will bring you right back here to me."
I was sitting there, thinking 'bout her pretty face,
Kicking myself for not catchin' her name.
I threw my hat and said, "You fool, it could've been love."
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down.
She probably didn't like me anyhow.
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust.
Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me,
Or am I really seein' what I think I see.
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me-ee-eee.
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but somethin' felt right.
When she stopped in and asked Miss Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me.
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin' "Son, it's way too dry"
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin' it's the best love we've made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they wanna cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, ha ha ha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
I'm walkin' down the stree, shufflin' my feet
Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by
I Like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow layin' low
Rolling anywhere that the wind wanna blow
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry
Baby, what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions everyday
I can lean in to hold you, or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I
Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving
Baby those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I
Still give you what you need
Still take your breath away
Or light up the spark way down deep, baby do I
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Tell me baby do I get one more try
Do I, baby do I
There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
That's what country is
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is
It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with
I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over 'cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on
It'll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Girl, don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
We've been up here in this city.
Livin' in the grease and grime.
Girl it's a doggone pity
We haven't been gettin' any time.
I've been preachin' bout back home.
It can make you feel so alive.
I'll tell ya what we can do,
Baby let's me and you take a little drive
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
There ain't no card in your pocket.
If your gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here.
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like that coke in a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
That straw in your hair,
Not an ounce of makeup on ya
As the sun goes down,
Girl I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now
Outro Chorus:
Dancin' on the step side
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
Dancing on the stepside,
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I'm holding on your rope
It's Like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard would
Love a good break
But they feel it too
Every time I see you
Why I gotta see you?
Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along
Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back
Keep chuggin' along
It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed to everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned
And two nights from then
I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again
I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man
I took hold of that can, and
I guess I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I ain't no quitter
The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah things got out of hand at that party
I said that's it, it's 'bout time I grow up
But that next weekend, I called all my friends and
I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
Yeah what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
Out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
Andy my 30-06, I'm runnin' out of Miller Light
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishin' one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killed's a twelve pack
Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
We'll I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
The only deer I've seen's been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
'Cause ain't no boss callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck but it's been a good day
Sittin' here, waitin' on a deer,
Hey girl
Go on now
You know you've got everybody looking
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Somebody's sweet little farmer shy,
With a gatle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile,
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it for the moon, shake it for me girl, aww
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Now dance like a dandelion
In the name of the hill underneath the pines, yeah
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby you know what to do
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it for the moon, shake it for me girl, aww
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
All we do right is make love
We both know now that ain't enough
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Baby, who we are just didn't work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let's kiss tomorrow goodbye
The cotton wood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive and a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime
Well if you ain't a ten, you're a 9.9
Tippin' and spillin' that homemade wine on your tied-up, t-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild, throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God Al-mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime
So, let's slip on out, where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take off on out in the water
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime
Girl, I'm a little drunk on you
We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out, scared she might get caught
We were nervous
But it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms, it finally made sense
In that moonlight
I saw her tanlines
Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
The fog rolled in, she said I better go
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir
She could keep
So I stayed and watched the sun rise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was
I can still see us
Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
Girl I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good
You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know the rising sun
Ain't no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas and the night's still alive
You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
I don't want this night to end
No, I don't want this night to end
He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think.
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"
But you don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma,
She said I couldn't stay.
And buddy if you're wonderin',
How could I throw it all away"
You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
If you never felt the fire,
Running through your veins,
If you've never seen the devil,
Face to face
You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God,
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack
There's peanut dust and corn husks driftin' through the air tonight
The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
There's a thermos and a water jug rollin' around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringin' us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til it's all done until we're all done
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again
And I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say
Is fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Oh, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Oh, fire away
Fire away
Used to spend my nights out in bar rooms
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottle
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
Streetlights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute, parachute
If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute, parachute
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness, well that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you
One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you
One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
Oh, that's the difference between whiskey and you
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
You're love's been so true
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
I was looking for change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign
And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me
One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Down on the freeway
The sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling
Tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night
One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
Well, she said, she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleeping on the floor
Think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned
Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bulletproof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood-shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth having, I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me, they'd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn't die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith in the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can't remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I'm sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it'll all feel the same way to me
Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Cut my teeth on Daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a red bar on my side
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky downtown Alabam'
Whole lotta like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah, they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to the Rio Grande
Whole lotta like I am all the time all the time
I'm in an outlaw state of mind
And there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran
Just don't give a damn all the time
in an outlaw state of mind
There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you been gone
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Postman delivered
"Past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
This morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
'Cause it's the holiday season."
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for living
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free
But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
Hold on my right hand
Sweat of the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
First you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that's in your hand
Want you to understand
I would've given it to you anyway
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up, I've finally changed
And that someone I was is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up, I've finally changed
And that someone I was is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
I woke up some mornings with I don't know who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'd hate to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of giving damns
All my tears are cried
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't help, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
It's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Won't you let me take it back
You know I told you that I don't love you
That I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby, I was wrong
What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby, I was wrong
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes, it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing 'round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always had a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems
Yeah, this morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, this morning I smoked them stems
Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row
Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row
When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, and it can't be sold
I got love, love to spare
That made me a millionaire
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She makes me, a millionaire
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In a beat up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say that boy is sure living in luxury, sweet luxury
Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
And that made me a millionaire
When her kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
Hey girl, you know what you've been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, whoever you've been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I'm what you need
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good-ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit

The one you crave when no one is around (I got your fix)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)

Good old boys and a hip-hop bass

Playing every song 'til your fingers bleed
Doing everything just tryna be
Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool

Lost a little love, broke a few hearts

It hurts so bad to watch you leave
We packed your stuff, and I set you free
Baby don't turn around
You don't want to see another tear fall down
Just keep heading towards anything that ain't me
We laid our hearts out on the table
Mine want you to stay, yours isn't it
I hope you find just what you're looking for

Back to me, back to me, back to me

Pulling back into that driveway

Don't say a word, or I'll be gone
You broke me down for so long
I been going over the things I could have done
But you never loved me enough
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I played your part, but it's time you said
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all
I stumbled home through the night
And as you slipped into my mind, mmm
We tried for so long, but you set the stage for the fall
My heart needs to learn that you're gone
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I'm putting these ghosts to rest, so don't say
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all
And all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
And I don't wanna hear you say that
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

What's up
I got my shades on top 
Back rolling with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby.
Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shining off the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride,
Breeze blowing in, your hair blowing round
You're scanning through the stations 
Looking for that country sound.
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be.
 
I got my shades on top 
Back rolling with the music, jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby.
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough, tangled up, and laid back and lazy.
Pour it on easy now,
Don't spill a bit!
Nothing but time tonight, 
Let's get to killing it!
Long as I'm rocking with you 
Girl, you know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it!
Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl, you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses, you got me missing signs
Hard looking left when my world is on my right
I got my shades on top 
Back rolling with the music, jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby.
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough, tangled up, and laid back and lazy.
Pour it on easy now,
Don't spill a bit!
Nothing but time tonight,

We can barely even see the band,
Out here by the beer stand, oh but you don't care,
You take my hand say you wanna dance and we're
Swayin', and prayin'

Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right,
Me rockin' you side to side,
Just stayin' in these arms of mine,
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
They say the shows sold out,
And it's one of there biggest crowds.
But all I see is two people right now,
Just me and you and all I wanna do
Is never leave this place,
With these arms around your waist.
Take a little break for a kiss, on your lips.

What you say you leave your friends with mine?
Ooh, ooh, they'll be all right, ooh, I just wanna see you shine.

Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it all right

Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
Yeah, let me see you girl.

'Cause I already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz over the thought of us
But I'll drink to a country song
Here's to another work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'll have to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart
'Cause I'm drinkin' to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raisin' my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'll have to drown your memory
Baby you ain't worth the whiskey
Here's to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raisin' my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'll have to drown your memory
No, don't think for a second I'll have to drown your memory
Girl, you ain't worth the whiskey
No, you ain't worth the whiskey
There's a sun set setting on another good night,
Little can't wait tailgate party on ice.
Chilling in the back of a four-wheel drive,
'Bout to pop a top, let it rock.
Some are gonna wanna fight, some are gonna wanna dance,
Some are gonna wanna carry 'round one in each hand.
Yeah, we all have a get a little crazy plan
When we break out and we go out.
Everybody's working out doing twelve ounce curls.
Boys buzzing, hung up on the country girls,
Fishing for the line that'll kick her heart into gear.
Hey brother, need another over here.
Got the Kid Rock good time playlist on.
All the worries in the world, they 'bout to be gone.
Some drunk dude's in the crowd yelling, "Let's get weird, y'all."
Brought to you by a beer.
A hungover headache, sun coming up.
Got her number, no name, can't remember what it was.
If you can't find your wallet or your phone or your truck,
Must have done it good, talking real good.
You're hurting now, dragging 'round, moving slow
But at least you got the stories and pizza on the stove.
Let hovering on to eight hours to go
Till it's back on, tie one off.
Everybody's working out doing twelve ounce curls.
Boys buzzing, hung up on the country girls,
Fishing for the line that'll kick her heart into gear.
Hey brother, need another over here.

It's all brought to you by a beer.
It'll get your head hurting in the morning light.
It'll get you hungover, it'll get you back right.
Hell, you might even have yourself a chance tonight.
When I've been gone, when I'm right here,
The minute my eyes open in the morning.
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway.
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming.
My mind just can't escape you,
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew.
I want you trust me, I want you to love me,
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose.
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you.
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about,
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you.
When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled,
When your holding everything together for me.
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me.
The way you know I'm holding something inside.
Don't know what time has for us,
But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of
I want you trust me, I want you to love me,
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose.
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you.
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about,
All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you.
Yeah, I just want you [x2]
Baby, all week, yeah, you and me
Have been raring to go, ready for this show.
Got a buzz on, and the sun's gone.
You can't see for the crowd, let me help you out.
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders.
Here, take my cuzzi so your can stays colder.
Be my country song sing-along beer holder.
Hurry up baby, 'fore this song's over.
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders.
Got a spot for your tan legs 'round my red neck
Where you can outshine that big spotlight
And get the party started.
Girl show the world how pretty you are.
And get up, get up, get up on my shoulders.
Here, take my cuzzi so your can stays colder.
Be my country song sing-along beer holder.
Hurry up baby, 'fore this song's over.
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders
Get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders.
Here, take my cuzzi so your can stays colder.

Climb on up, 'fore this song's over.
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders.

Be my country song sing-along beer holder.
Hurry up baby, 'fore this song's over.
Get up, get up, get up on my shoulders
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up on my shoulders
There's that flower shop on Main.
Lord it's been too long since it's seen my face.
I probably should've stopped by yesterday.
Just a few miles from our house.
There's a neon sign flashing "coldest beer in town."
Is she gone for good, well it's hard to say
But I'm going to be ready either way.
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us.
We'll either work it out or we won't.
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home, and a six pack if she don't.
I'm prayin' love will bring her back
Oh, just one more chance is all I'll ever ask
I sure hope she ain't a memory yet.
But she left her book there on the bed
Would a woman leave a man like that?
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us.
We'll either work it out or we won't.
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home, and a six pack if she don't.
Is she gone for good, well it's hard to say.
But I'm going to be ready either way.
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waitin' on me, baby
Why'd it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us.
We'll either work it out or we won't.
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
I got these dozen roses incase she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't.
And a six pack if she don't.
If there's a full moon hanging high
You can bet there's a jacked up four wheel drive.
Cruising with the crew with a beer on ice,
Looking for the girls that'll let their hair down.
Lead us on, get us thinking they might
Share a little sugar on a Friday night.
Making midnight memories lighting up the sky.
In the country side we turn it up loud.
Down here we keep the good times flowing,
Red dirt flying, and the radio going.
We got each other's back and everybody knows it,
Yeah me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up.
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys.
We're tighter than the tops will twist off
When the sun goes down and the work day's gone.
Like something straight out of a country song,
Raised up all farm tan tough.
With the scuffs all over our boots.
Little rough tangled up in our roots.
Yeah, we got a little soft side too
When the girls get us all wrapped up.
Down here we keep the good times flowing,
Red dirt flying, and the radio going.
We got each other's back and everybody knows it,
Yeah me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up.
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys.
Moon coming through the pines, cranking up a country song
Heaven right by your side, and a Saturday night barely hanging on
Sun shining through the stained glass, humming just as I am
I'm praying that feeling would last, that feeling that saves you
Makes you wanna raise your hands
That's the way it was, and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go.
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times, there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads, where momma saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls
That's the way it was, and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do but say uh huh
Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner
Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do?
What would Dierks do?
Grab a guitar and go sing her a song
And go play one of my songs?
No, don't play one of yours, play one of mine, man!
Yeah, sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner
Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
We were gonna dance till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over, couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park, hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around wast scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it
'Cause I'm sitting here knowing what it's gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear ya say ya miss me tonight
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Baby I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time
People slowing down wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
'Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want know one to see me this way
Don't need no gas, don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just fine
I just need another minute or two
Till this songs over like me and you
I'm sitting here knowing what it's gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear ya say you miss me tonight
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
Yeah baby I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on but I'm here like this,
Off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
Yeah baby I'm broke down but it ain't the truck this time
No it ain't the truck this time
I got nowhere go, nowhere to be
I'm nobody baby if you don't love me
Boot flask full of Jack
Nobody'd look, nobody'd ask
Holding out on a 10 o'clock 12-pack
Win or lose, it didn't matter
'Cause soon as those jerseys hit the field
You know that's when it got real
With the rivalry's and ride-with-me's
And let-me-know-where-you're-gonna-be's
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
T8 still on her cheek
Party in a field, she danced with me
That pull you close, bottled up all week
Win or lose, it didn't matter
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
We had those bragging rights to all those Friday nights
The stadium lights, those stadium lights
At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
Yeah, they're still falling in love at the home game
You're up on your high heels, you're up on the bar
You're up on a level, up there with the shooting stars
Dancing around the drinks with honky tonk angel wings
Making the party sing, yeah, that's my baby
It ain't even midnight yet, there's a whole lot of neon left
Looks like we're gonna get all kinds of crazy
We'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me up
You're up on the tailgate, you're up on a 3 beer buzz
You're up like the music pumping out of the cab of my truck
Up where the city lights came can't but get, get outshines
By the blue jeans and brown eyes I pull in closer
Yeah, this night's far from over with
Still up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me
Up on a high like I'm walking on clouds
Baby, tonight I don't wanna come down
You'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me
Up on a high like I'm walking on clouds
Baby, tonight I don't wanna come down
I don't wanna come down
There she was, little blue jean buzz
Just bare footing around
I said, "What's up?" She hopped in the truck
And we were right away running the town
She's the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
And everything dark just lights up
But all summers end, now she's gone with the wind
And the reason I spend so many nights up
Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party wa-wa-wasn't over
I still hear her laughing like it just happened
Like I was just with her hear
Well, she had the magic and I had the habit
But then she just disappeared
See, I'm the kinda guy that just can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try, she's all I think about
Another lesson learned, but hey, the world still turns
So I guess it's time to turn another drink up
Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
These days, I can't even hear a wave crash
And I get carried away and go George Strait back
To a slow dance out in the sand
When the keg was still cold and she was holding my hand
Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
No, it wasn't over
Yeah, this party, this party, this party wasn't over
Hands still swaying, band still playing
Damn, this party wasn't over
This party, this party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party, this party wasn't over
When I feel my phone buzzing, ain't even gotta look down
I know it's you that's calling, a couple drinks in by now
So I say, "Hello," you say, "Hey, babe"
Say you're 'bout to catch a cab over to my place
"See you in five," but, baby, this time
Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Ain't gonna lie, if you knock on my door
I'm gonna let you walk in
Let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
But you know in the morning
We're gonna regret everything we did
So why even start what ain't good for our parts
Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Keep sipping your drink, keep spinning the room
Keep chasing the night like you always do
Keep letting gate good times play
Don't let me get in your way
Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Stay downtown
Yeah, this time around, baby, stay downtown
It's perfect outside; it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it', 'better stop and take it in' kinda scenes
Everything's just right yeah except for one thing
You should be here, standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying "Cheers, hey y'all, it's sure been a good year"
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone
Showing 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face
You should be here, standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying, "Cheers, hey y'all, it's sure been a good year"
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here
You'd be loving this, you'd be freaking out, you'd be smiling, yeah
I know you'd be all about what's going on right here, right now
God, I wish somehow you could be here
Oh, you should be here
Yeah, this is one of those moments that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I have just one wish, it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here
You should be here
You wish on a party underneath 'em
Way out there where it's easy to see 'em, stars
Yeah, if they line, tonight you're gonna
Thank your lucky ones for shining down on you, stars
You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang alone with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars
You stare at 'em, swear if you could reach 'em
You'd give her one 'cause she's got you seeing the stars
Since that night she stole your heart
You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang alone with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars
She fell from 'em so you point your prayers at 'em
'Cause she's got you feeling about as high as 'em
Since you stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang alone with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars
Stars
Girl I swear
I get scared looking in your eyes
Start thinking about where I'd be now
If I wasn't with you tonight
I've done a lot of crazy things
But you saved me and you reeled me in
There ain't no doubt
I'd take us right now
Over me back when
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way
Making my way to you
Yeah, Making my way
Making my way to you
Now I know why all those
Wrong ones didn't work out
It's easy to see
But hard to believe
That I got my arms around
My forever, I coulda never
Dreamed it up this good
Ain't it funny how
Things work out
Better than you
Thought they would
Back when a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way to you
I didn't know what
I was looking for
No, I didn't have a clue
Next thing I know
I'm thanking the lord
For everything I went through
Making my way
Making my way to you
While I was
Makng my way
Making my way to you, yeah
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way
Making my way to you
Baby, I've been
Making my way
Making my way to you
Yeah, a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Raise 'em up high
If you're with me tonight
It's no can left behind
Let me lay it
All out on the table
If you're here then
You're willing and able
To let go of that long week
And get a little weekend
Carried away
How 'bout a 12-pack packed
Just between us
We're gonna drink 'em all gone
Y'all, this is some serious stuff
As far as I can tell
They can't consume themselves
So let's throw
A little help their way
Raise 'em up high
If you're with me tonight
We're on a cold case mission

To hell with our problems

A pretty good plan y'all
The beer's not gonna drink itself
So uh, there's a couple left
There's one for me
I'll just keep that one cold
I don't trust ya to drink it all
Remember boys, never let a lady open the door
And be there with a lighter if she wants a smoke
Remember boys, never let her go to sleep crying
When she tells you about her dreams you gotta fill 'em up with hope
'Cause I don't wanna be a "one night" boy
And I don't want to be an "ain't right" boy
I don't wanna be a "had a ball, waited out no call kind of love song" boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June till September
I wanna be one those remember boys
Remember boys, always open her beer first
And tell her that you love her, even when she makes you mad
And remember boys, no matter you make it work
You want her need and her and fight to keep her
Let her know you know what you have
I don't wanna be a "one night" boy
And I don't want to be an "ain't right" boy
I don't wanna be a "had a ball, waited out no call kind of love song" boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June till September
I wanna be one those remember boys
No I don't wanna be a "late night" boy
I don't wanna be a heart break boy
I don't wanna be a "can't trust him with your love", kind of loser boy
I don't wanna be be a regret
Or the one she forgets
I don't wanna be a June till September
I wanna be one those remember boys
That's right...
I wanna be one of those remember boys
Here we go y'all
It's going down tonight
Me and the boys, headed down to the club
Rolling 5 deep, all packed in the truck
Kicking up dust, we 'bout to bust through the door
They ain't ever seen nothing like us before
But they about to
Who's with me, how about you
Yeah
It's about to get
Hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
Talking girls pouring the shots
Boys spilling their beer
Everybody dancing with their hands up
The DJ playing what you wanna hear
If you rocking the smoke, rocking the drink
If you ain't gonna stop, then you rolling with me
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when we wake up
Getting right tonight before it disappears
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
No, we ain't the only ones came here with a plan
The hot girl in the corner's got four hot friends
A couple 10-10's, gather down and we're in
So it's a win-win, 'cause we 'bout to get bent
In a good way, looks like we found the right place
Hey
It's about to get
Hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
Talking girls pouring the shots
Boys spilling their beer
Everybody dancing with their hands up
The DJ playing what you wanna hear
If you rocking the smoke, rocking the drink
If you ain't gonna stop, then you rolling with me
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when we wake up
Getting right tonight before it disappears
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
It's about to get hoppin'
No we ain't stopping
We're gonna keep rockin'
Till the cops come knockin'
It's about to get
Hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
Talking girls pouring the shots
Boys spilling their beer
Everybody dancing with their hands up
The DJ playing what you wanna hear
If you rocking the smoke, rocking the drink
If you ain't gonna stop, then you rolling with me
We can worry 'bout tomorrow when we wake up
Getting right tonight before it disappears
Oh yeah, it's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
Hoppin' in here, oh yeah
Everybody, everybody got their hands up
It's a party tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow when we wake up
Ha ha
The dam broke in her blue eyes
When that goodbye
Slipped off of my tongue
I said, "Girl, you gonna be fine"
"In no time, you'll be moving on"
I didn't think it'd be this fast
But looking through the plate glass
Of this bar
She's up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
Boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
Yeah, I was wanting these new wings
So I could do things
Anything that I want
Thought I was gonna fly high
Turns out I couldn't be more wrong
I think I got a broken pair
'Cause I should be up there
Where she is
Yeah, way up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
This ain't what I had in mind
This heart full of regret
Forever left behind
With this picture in my head
Of her up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me wishing that I was that mic stand
Man, I was so blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
And no signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
That's right
And she's up there rocking
And I'm getting forgotten tonight
High noon in a gun slingin' town
Steel spurs clinking on the red dirt ground 
Saloon doors swinging wide open 
It's about to go down
Outlaws ridin' out of the hills
Shootin' moonshine and shotgun shells
A bunch of hell raisers wanna send you to your maker
No time to saddle up so you gotta act now and
Shoot from the hip
Ask questions later
Shoot from the hip c'mon (woo hoo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo hoo)
Shoot from the hip
The dust settles
The barrels go cold
And it's deuces wild at the watering hole
Turns out cards and hard liquor don't mix too well
And this joker with an ace up his sleeve
And a midnight special where nobody can see
I show him four of a kind 
He gets red in the eye
He flips the table over
I reach for mine and 
Shoot from the hip
Ask questions later
Shoot from the hip c'mon (woo hoo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo hoo)
Shoot from the hip
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You won't find me six feet under
You won't find me takin' cover
'Cause I'm more than the roar of the thunder
Shoot from the hip
Ask questions later
Shoot from the hip c'mon (woo hoo)
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip
Shoot from the hip
Sometimes the only peace maker
Is a hairpin trigger in a fingertip
You gotta shoot from the hip (woo hoo)
Shoot from the hip
Shoot from the hip (woo hoo) oh,
Shoot from the hip
It hurts when you hold me lately
So come on and hurt me baby
The spell that I'm in
The burn on my skin
The love, the hate, the high of the pain
You're everything that drives me crazy
You got me flying down a James Dean highway
Love drunk and sliding sideways
Not watching the road
Not holding the wheel
You can't even hear the tires squeal
And once again I go down in flames
In your arms of fire
I can't escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I'll never cross
'Cause everything in me is wantin' to fall
To your arms of fire
Your kiss, my soul demands it
I tried the cold but I can't stand it
No
Drawn to a spark, deep in the dark
It's pulling me, tugging me, tares me apart
Here's my heart, go on and brand it
In your arms of fire
I can't escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I'll never cross
'Cause everything in me is wantin' to fall
To your arms of fire
It hurts when you hold me lately
So come on and hurt me baby
In your arms of fire
I can't escape
Staying or leaving, hurts either way
Waking a wire, I'll never cross
'Cause everything in me is wantin' to fall
To your arms of fire
To your arms of fire
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really shouldn't be
Give it one more call
It's one more "whatcha doin' right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone and I'm picking up the phone
One more call
It's one more "whatcha doin' right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer...
I can tell that you're lonely
Pour it all out on me
Because I have been lonely too
That's a heartache you're drinkin'
And I can feel what you're thinkin'
Let's do what the lonely do
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you
Take everything that makes you sad
Let it out and leave it in the past
You don't need that for what I've got in mind
Wrap those arms around me
Close your eyes and baby you'll see
It ain't that hard to leave it all behind
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you
Your lips, your shoulders and my fingertips
Runnin' through your hair, just like this
Whatever it takes to make your heart forget
I'll do
Baby, let me love the lonely out of you
Starin' at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
Sittin' with the finest example of a beautiful girl
If we hadn't hit the brakes, we'd have no idea
Paradise was hiding right here
Dipping our toes in the water,
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you and me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing and we're doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about is filling up when the ice cubes clink
Dipping our toes in the water,
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm
Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed, a kiddie pool, a slip and sled, let that garden hose run
Dipping our toes in the water,
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun and mix it with rum
Mix it with rum mmm mmm mm mm
Fridge is leakin' and the faucets drippin'
Smoke detector chirps all night
The squeaky screen door with a hole big enough
To let the neighborhood bugs inside
Out back Jack's got a chop top Cadillac
Three years up on blocks
The junk mail box lookin' like it's been drinkin'
Leanin' to 11 o'clock
We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich
Laid back lax lettin' go and lovin' this
Itty bitty slice of American pie
Some folks think it's all about the money, honey
We're livin' proof that ain't right
We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich
We work a long day
Sunup to payday
For a life this big
If you're broke don't fix it
Learn to live with it
And like it just the way it is
When you're dirt rich
When you're dirt rich
Oh, yep when you're dirt rich
When you're dirt rich
Now and then I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though it's been so long it brings me back
Right back to you
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
How yah been I'd love to hear bout how you been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had and love to have again
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah

The smoke and the whiskey, ain't gonna miss me when I'm gone.
I thought that they needed me, but really they were leading me on.
It gets old waking up with your head in a vice, feeling empty as a bottle of jack.
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back
You get me high, you get me stoned, it's a ride I ain't never been on.
It's a binge, it's a buzz, it's a drunk I can't find in no glass.
Yeah, I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back.
Bright lights, and guitars, and dive bars, playing for tips.
And pouring your heart out to strangers, is a strange kind of fix.
But filling a dance floor, is something I live for, but I give more than I'll ever get back.
But I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back.
You get me high, you get me stoned, it's a ride I ain't never been on.
It's a binge, it's a buzz, it's a drunk I can't find in no glass,
Yeah, I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back.
The smoke and the whiskey, ain't gonna miss me when I'm gone.

It's a binge, it's a buzz, it's a drunk I can't find in no glass,
Yeah, I finally found something worth loving, that's loving me back,
That's loving me back.
The same sky, the same clouds, the same dirt,
The same ground we all live and die on
The same song, the same beat, the same car,
The same street we run down our dreams on
We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down,
We're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white,
We're all just American crazy
Just American crazy
Straight A's and drop-outs, up north, 'n' down south,
We all bleed the same blood
Paycheck to paycheck, sun up to sun set,
We're lovers and leavers, we're sinners and believers
We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down,
We're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white,
We're all just American crazy
Just American crazy
Same tune, same town, same school, same crowd,
Same fight for the home team, same love, same dream
We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down,
We're all just American crazy
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white,
We're all just American crazy
We're lost, we're found, we're up, we're down
We're left, we're right, we're black, we're white,
We're just American crazy
Yeah, we're all just American crazy
Wish I could say it was gonna get better but we oughta know better by now
Gonna pack my shit into a cardboard box and get the hell outta this house
Gonna roll on for the road hit more than that county line
This whole world has gone to pot and right now so am I
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' till the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
I don't know what took so long to say so-long to you
All you do is wear me out just like the evening news
So you can plant your garden where you used to chew my ass
Yeah I don't want this dirt no more I'm tradin' it for grass
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' till the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Roll it up, light it up, take a little toke,
Hit it till it all goes up in smoke
Puff, puff, pass it around, back to myself by now
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
Gettin' stoned so it don't matter
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' till the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
I tried prayin' to the Man up high
I tried drinkin' till the well ran dry
I'm movin' on to greener pastures
It might look like the same old same
The same old town, the same old name
Come right in, sit right down
Find yourself hanging around
For a couple more days
And I'm here to tell you for a pretty small town
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down an old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to kicking and anything goes
My mind, amen
Just wait until the stars go down
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home
Just sing along with the radio
Just the good old boys playing Kurtis Blow
Cheap guitars play out of tune
Barefoot dancing underneath the moon
It's a hell of a show
And what happens in the river we don't talk about
It's just a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Yes there is
Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down an old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to kicking and anything goes
My my, amen
Just wait until the stars come up
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home
Hey, hey, dig a little deeper
Drive a little further down that old dirt road
Old crow, gets a little sweeter
Once it gets to thinking and anything goes
My my, amen
Just wait until the stars come up
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
There's a whole lot of something going down, down, down
Down home
Down home
The sun's goin' down and I just came back
You're goin' out with friends
You're in a dress I've never seen before, and your lipstick
A deeper shade of red
Your kiss goodbye don't hit quite right
And neither does your alibi
Yeah baby, do your thing
Go on and have a good time
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?
Sittin' in the dark, tellin' myself
Everything's cool
I'm not the jealous type, but I'm startin' to feel like
A heartbroke fool
Sippin' on a half drunk pint that's startin' to
Rattle up my brain
Are my instincts right or am I drinkin'
Myself insane?
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?
You just got home, must've lost your keys
'Cause you're sneakin' in the window
You see me sittin' there, you don't say a thing
'Cause you know that I know
I don't believe it
You got me feeling like a pistol
Whatever you say
Who's in your heart shaped locket?
Blame the whiskey on the beer
Blame the beer on the whiskey
Blame the mornin' on the night
For whose lyin' here with me
Blame the bar for the band
Blame the band for the song
Blame the song for the party that went all night long
But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault
Blame the heart for the hurtin'
Blame the hurtin' on the heart
Blame the dark on the devil
Blame the devil on the dark
Blame the ex for the drinkin'
Blame the drinkin' for the ex
Blame the two for one tequila's for whatever happens next
But it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong I'd done
But it ain't my fault
I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain't my fault
Blame my reason on my name
Blame my name on my reason
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn't take a joke
But it ain't my fault
I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I'm only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
No it ain't my fault
I've been through ups and downs
I haven't known which way to turn
And when I wander through this town
I only think of you
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
On the day that I was born
The cards were dealt, the dice were thrown
I think my destiny was drawn
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
I built myself a prison cell
The walls are painted blue
Only you can let me out
Only you
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
I hit the highway and I checked the time
I see the sunrise and it makes me wanna change my mind
Oh I got it bad
I stopped for a coffee in a nowhere town
A pretty waitress says "Hey what's the frown
Boy you got it bad"
Well so many times you told me before
If you don't like it, well there's the door
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder then the devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Ooh I got it bad
Moonlight on the water still looks the same
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name
Guess I got it bad
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care
I'll believe her if she says hey baby
I got to love to spare
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man
Tonight I'm taking all I can
This time I went for good and I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder then the devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Ooh I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder then the devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Ooh I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder then the devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Ooh I got it bad
Hello blue stranger sittin' there all alone
With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home
Maybe you will let me buy a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Hello blue stranger I haven't seen your around
But I know every reason for leavin' town
We might know each other before the night is through
I'm a blue stranger too
And strangers fall in love everyday
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us a little unsure of their ways
Well hello blue stranger will you take a chance
I might be mistaken but I see meaning in your glance
Maybe this could be the start of something new
I'm a blue stranger too
And strangers fall in love all the time
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us a little unsure of sharin' eyes
Hello blue stranger sittin' there all alone
With you glass of sorrow you seem so far away from home
Maybe you will let me buy you a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Hello blue stranger, Hello blue stranger
Hello blue stranger
Oh girl you get to me
In a way I can't believe
I need you
And who knows where just friends ends
When your cross that line and love begins
In over my head and the water's turnin' blue
But what would I do
Without you
What would I do
Without you
Hearts never know the way
They want to go and want to stay
We need two
But in time you find the road
And though inside you know you've gotta go
The hardest part I find
Is you're all I ever knew
But what will I do
Without you
What will I do
Without you
I gotta break these habit chains I put on me
And be all that I can be, try and find
What I need
Memories suspend in time
All the days when you were mine
And the chance I took to move
One I thought I'd never do
But I made it through
Without you
I made it through
Without you
From what would I do
Without you
To I made it through
Without you, Without you
Repeat to fade
The light shines down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh how I wish I was lying in the
Arms of Mary
She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into feel good
Oh how I wish I was lying in the
Arms of Mary
Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know
She put me right on the first mistake
And the summer wasn't gone
When I'd learned all she had to give
She really gave all a boy could take
Oh...
So now when I get lonely
Still looking for my one and only
That's when I wish I was lying in the
Arms of Mary
Oh Mary
Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know
She put me right on the first mistake
And summer wasn't gone
When I'd learned all she had to give
She really gave all a boy could take...
So now when I get lonely
I'm still lookin' for my one and only
That's when I whish I was lying in the
Arms of Mary
The light shines down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh how I wish I was lying in the
Arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
I'm lying in the arms of Mary
Ooh... Mary
I remember as a kid wishin' I was seventeen
No more school, my own car.
Back then it was all a dream
Then came the day to say goodbye to the room that was once mine
One last look at my old world then
I closed the door behind, to
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
Well thirty-five soon rolled around
And everything had changed
I could count friends on one hand and
The good times weren't the same
But finally I cam to understand why people say
Don't spend all your childhood wishin'
The best years away
Now I'm longin' for the freedom
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
That I let slip away
I took it all for granted
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
Now it's gone like yesterday
Remembering all those years, yesterday
I've seen it happen too many times
And just where it starts I don't know
You're travelling steady but you don't see the signs
That tell you there's a fork in the road
And you don't think it's right but you're both turnin' away
And the ending is always the same
When suddenly parallel lives drift apart
And there's no one accepting the blame
But girl you and I we got too much too lose
By one of us saying goodbye
And I see it clearly we're both meant to be
But you got that look in your eyes
Don't go, don't go
Cause you might regret everything
When you wake up on your own
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go
And I never will surrender what we got together
Layin' beside you I can't sleep at all
Wonderin' what your thinkin' inside
Will I wake up and find that
You've made up your mind to
Go it alone for awhile
And don't say it's present when it's all in the past
You gotta stop lookin' behind
And take everything as it comes for today is
The first day of the rest of your life
Don't go, don't go
Cause you might regret everything
When you wake up on your own
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go
And I never will surrender what we got together
Don't go, oh never say goodbye, Don't go
Oh no, you got that look in your eyes
I've seen it before, you're gonna walk out that door
Don't go, don't go
Cause you might regret everything
When you wake up on your own
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go
And I never will surrender what we got together
Don't go, don't go
Cause you might regret everything
When you wake up on your own
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go
And I never will surrender what we got together
Monday morning, another workin' week ahead
Friday seems so far away
The clock keeps ringin', I gotta get up out of bed
Maybe this could be the day
Motivation, well it keeps you holdin' on
Every step of the way
Headin' in the right direction when you think you're turnin' wrong
Lookin' out for when you stray
So hear what I say
There's no other way, you gotta
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause everything ya see
Comes true if you believe in holdin'
On to your dreams
Well I know sometimes it's hard to see the light
Shinin' at the tunnel's end
And though the road just goes on and on for miles
Faith lives just around the bend
So now and then, remember
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
And everything ya see
Comes true if you believe in holdin'
On to your dreams
Just like your eyes are the window to the soul
Dreams are the highway that lead to your goal
Hold on, hold on
You've got to hold on
Hold on
(Oh, you just got to hold on)
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby,
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams,
'Cause someday baby,
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause everything ya see,
Comes true if you believe
In holding on to your dreams.
Can't believe it, guess I'll never understand
Seems to me, I'm lookin' at someone who's
An unchanged man
Tell me, what've I gotta do
To make you see that she's always loved you
Right there waitin' in the wings
Unaware of the foolish things you do, think about it
She would never do a thing to hurt you
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide
You're takin' everything she gives for granted
You got it all and still I don't know why
You're lovin' on the side
If somebody told her 'bout your secret ways
Do you think you'd ever find another
Who could take her place
I'd give everything I own
Just to have what you got at home
But still you are never satisfied
Why do you keep lovin' on the side when you know
She would never do a thing to hurt you
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide
You're takin' everything she gives for granted
You got it all and still I don't know why
You're lovin' on the side
Tell me what I've gotta do
To make you see that she always loved you
Right there waitin' in the wings
Unaware of the foolish things you do,
Well think about it
You're lovin' on the side
Lovin' on the side
She would never do a thing to hurt you
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide
You're takin' everything she gives for granted
You got it all and still I don't know why
You're lovin' on the side
It's six Monday morning, she's back into her routine
Kicks off the covers and thinks about last night's dream
Shower and coffee, she heads for the train
Thinkin' how every day's the same
There's gotta be more than life of her own
All that she wants is a man to come home too
She's lookin' for someone to love her
And stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too
She's lookin' for somebody to hold her
Until the light of day
Someone she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
Late in the evening she is dreamin' in black and white
An old love story she wishes portrayed her life
No one would know what goes on her mind
Thinkin' it's only a matter of time
Till someday she finds what she's lookin' for
And her ship'll come sailin' into her shore
She's lookin' for someone to love her
And stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too
She's lookin' for somebody to hold her
Until the light of day
Someone she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
She's lookin' for someone to love her
And stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too
She's lookin' for somebody to hold her
Until the light of day
Someone she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
We've spent a long time side by side
Guess I've loved you forever
Sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried
Still we made it together
I don't know what I'd do without you
Girl you make me smile
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you
Oh you drive me wild
Baby our love is still comin' on strong
You give me strength that I needed so long
I can't explain how I feel in my heart
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart
Now here you are still in my arms
After so many years have gone
It seems we both were meant to be
Now that all of the tears have gone
And when it's time to settle down
And get ourselves a home
I'll be beside you all the way
Never again will you be alone
Baby our love is still comin' on strong
You give me strength that I needed so long
I can't explain how I feel in my heart
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart
I know a place where love flows like water
You sit on the bank and pass the time away
So take my hand I want to show you something
My very own lover's hideaway
And I will take you down the river
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree
I'll take you down to the river
Where you and I can just be you and me
I see us know just lyin' underneath the heavens
Sippin' on wine with nothing much to do
Just you in my arms when the sun is settin'
Then makin' sweet love in the night of Mr Moon
And I will take you down the river
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree
I'll take you down to the river
Where you and I can just be you and me
You know I"ll love you anyway
All I will feel the same until the sun don't shine
All I want to do is stay
'Cause you're a once in every lifetime ooh
And I will take you down the river
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree
I'll take you down to the river
Where you and I can just be you and me
And I will take you down the river
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree
I'll take you down to the river
Where you and I can just be you and me
You come here lookin' for sympathy
'Cause it's not everything you thought it would be
Don't waste your time
You can't understand why it comes and goes
The sudden storms, the highs and lows
So you stand here cryin'
Girl get in line.
What love is that way
You're wastin' time pretending
What love is that way
When you walk through life expecting
So much, so soon
Love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way.
The more you wish and the more you dream
The more the reality never seems
What it ought to be
It's never perfect as when it begins
Time always seems to put an end
To the fantasy, It seems to me.
What love is that way
You're wastin' time pretending
What love is that way
When you walk through life expecting
So much, so soon
Love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way.
So much, so soon, love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way, 
What love is that way.
What love is that way
You're wastin' time pretending
What love is that way
When you walk through life expecting
So much, so soon
Love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way...
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home.
I left the office in a flash on Friday
Threw my boots in the car
Cashed my pay cheque and headed for the country
To sleep out underneath the stars
I drove all day Saturday and right into the evenin'
Till there were no more city lights
Those broken lines were gettin' blurry
Through my windscreen
Well I guess I drove all night
Then Sunday mornin' found me rollin' into sunrise
With my fuel gauge dead
I pulled into fill up, found the place deserted
And a little sign that read.
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home.
All I could do is call up a tow truck
To take me further down the road
I fumbled round and round for some change in my pocket,
Walked fifteen minutes to the phone
There in the phone book I found a business ad-vert,
Saying "Use Us Instead"
I dialed the number and a tape recorder answered
And it politely said.
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home.
I finally got back home and it took forever
Then at work the next day. Somebody said.
"Hey the boss said he wants to see you
In his office right away"
He told me just how far behind the work was getting
And on the weekend could I stay
I started laughin' and said 'You must be kiddin'
I just got one thing to say... you know what I said.
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at.
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home.
I'm quite entitled to one day,
To spend with my family at home...
Runnin' from the rate race
Just as fast as I can
Take off my tie so I can breathe
Me, I'm going where the fresh air's blowin'
Take a little walk in the country with me.
Walk in the country with me
Watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good
To get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me.
I'm so sick of all them TV shows
I need some dirt road under my feet
C'mon let's point our toes where the red fern grows
Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now.
Walk in the country with me
Watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good
To get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me.
Walkin' the country
Oh bless my soul
Just gimme that country road
Come on now.
Walk in the country with me
Watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good
To get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me.
Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now baby
Take a little walk in the country with me...
You spun your web back a Sunday or two
I ain't never met nobody
Like the likes of you
You got me preachin' the news
You turned down my road and decided to stay
And I took a shine to your hair
And your hillbillly ways
And how you kiss on my face
I got a bone deep feelin'
You're the start of the good ole days.
Well, I still remember
You came by my trailer
With chicken and some homemade wine
The dogs got to barkin'
When we got the sparkin'
We almost set the house on fire
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for
But honey your homespun love
Just keeps me comin' back for more.
I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard
And I like the notions you stick in my head and my heart
Yeah, and how you fix on my car
Well, I reckon I'm lucky you're everything I need so far.
Well, I still remember
You came by my trailer
With chicken and some homemade wine
The dogs got to barkin'
When we got the sparkin'
We almost set the house on fire
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for
But honey your homespun love
Just keeps me comin' back for more...
I heard the rumor that we're callin' it off
And we won't last too long
But I got this feelin' when I'm looking at you, baby
They couldn't be more wrong
They've been sayin' it's a shaky romance
And they don't give the two of us too much of a chance.
But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then ooh baby, this is just some love
Ooh baby, this is just some love.
I speak my mind baby that's the truth
But you've got a temper too
So when they see us start to fuss and fight
I guess they think we're through
But if they're judgin' us by what they see
Then they don't have a clue about you and me.
'Cause if the Rocky Mountains are just some hills
Niagra Falls is just some water spills
And if Humphrey Bogart was just some tough
Then ooh baby, this is just some love
Ooh baby, this is just some love.
But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then ooh baby, this is just some love
Ooh baby, this is just some love.
Ooh baby, this is just some love.
Ooh baby, this is just some love...
It was about five till five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said "You and you come with me
'Cause you're gonna have to stay"
My heart was thumping, I was jumping
I had to get away
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
When the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Well, I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
When she asked a loaded question
She said "How do you feel about me?"
My mind was racin' I was pacin'
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing left to do
I feel it coming on
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
When the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
I can feel your goodbye comin'
Like a storm up from the south
The rain'll splatter at the back door
The wind'll whistle 'round the house
So it's you and Howie Johnston
Somebody told me at the store
I guess I'd better get used
To the idea of you
Not around anymore.
And so, I'm doin' my best to prepare for the worst
And I'd better get use to the hunger and thirst
I gotta find me a potion
To take for the pain
And all you've got to lose
Is my last name.
I know he's cute and he's got money
I ain't no handsome fancy Dan
In a way it's sad and kinda funny
You'll be ok and I'll be damned
So I best be gettin' ready
For the bitter nights alone
Sleepin' on the couch
Wake up starting out
Livin' life on my own.
And so, I'm doin' my best to prepare for the worst
And I'd better get use to the hunger and thirst
I gotta find me a potion
To take for the pain
And all you've got to lose
Is my last name.
Yeah, all you've got to lose is my last name...
It's killin' me to write the word 'goodbye'
I've wadded up and tossed a thousand tries
We both know the reason
There ain't nothing to explain
But I know that my leavin'
Will spare us both the pain.
Desiree, I can't hold you any longer
Desiree you love his money more than me
And the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
I love you Desiree.
It'd be easier to leave if I were mad
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have 
And to write this note to you
Was the hardest thing to do
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy
Who can't afford a girl like you.
Desiree, I can't hold you any longer
Desireem you love his money more than me
And the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
I love you Desiree.
God, I love you Desiree
But I just can't take it anymore
I won't be around for your goodbye
I won't be around for your goodbye.
You love his money more than me
I won't be around for your goodbye
You love his money more than me
I won't be around for your goodbye.
Oh, you love his money, 
You love it more than me
I was just a fool who couldn't see
That you love his money, 
You love it more than me...
I'm on a red dirt road windin up to a sky of blue,
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two,
No more sittin' at home, leave the TV and the telephone far behind,
This life is killin' us all, and back roads are lookin' mighty fine,
Oh and
Freedom's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Yeah freedom's finally mine,
It's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh freedom's finally mine
I'd like to throw out the cellular
And kick off these shop-shined shoes
Leave the kids at your mama's
And take off to Timbuktu,
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks,
Leadin off to way out back o' yonder,
There's no mountain I can't climb,
To satisfy this need of mine to wander,
Oh cause
Freedom's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Yeah freedom's finally mine,
It's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh freedom's finally mine
There's no desert I can't cross,
No river too wide,
I can do what I want now,
Cause freedom's finally mine,
Yeah
Oh freedom
Freedom's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Yeah freedom's finally mine,
It's finally mine,
(I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh freedom, oh freedom,
It's finally mine,
Yeah it's mine,
It's finally mine,
Yeah it's mine,
Oh, give it to me,
Oh freedom,
(Oh freedom)
I had a heck of a time gettin' into my house today
There was a big ass U-Haul trailer in my way
And she was headed for the car, so I grabbed my old guitar
I got one more chance before she drives away.
So
Hank, don't fail me now
You've always bailed me out
"Your Cheatin' Heart"
Could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine
That'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now.
Yeah, she was throwin' stuff, cussin' like a sailor at me
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees
If I could yodel her a lick
That just might do the trick
If I sang "I Saw The Light" would she believe?
(I don't think so.)
So
Hank, don't fail me now
You've always bailed me out
"Your Cheatin' Heart"
Could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine
That'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now.
Hank, don't fail me now
You've always bailed me out
"Your Cheatin' Heart"
Could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine
That'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now...
She's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now
She's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now
You know the cards are stacked against this
As we surrender our defenses
I've torn down all my fences just for you
And you feel it to what do we do?
Do we run or see it through?
The longer were together it just keeps getting better
And you hide your little love letters around the house for me
And its plain to see that you'll always be all I'll ever need
The webs we've spun
Wove into one
That this tangled up in love
You squeeze my hand 
I understand about a woman and a man
I love the way you make me feel
You've got me tangled up in love
The web we spun move into one
That this tangled up in love
You squeeze my hand 
I understand about a woman and a man
I love the way you make me feel
You've got me tangled up in love
You've got me tangled up in Love
Just like we're tangled up in love
You've got me tangled up in love
You've got me tangled up
Girl I'm tangled up in love
Well, I ain't proud of what I'm about to do
All alone up here with you
With the picture of your man
Face down upon the night stand, so he can't see
And I don't like running all the red lights here
Every time the coast is clear
Any time you need my lovin'
You know I'll come running, faithfully.
'Cause he stays so busy with his money
And you, you get so lonely when he's gone
And me, I'm just your temporary lover
'Til your blues are gone
I'm the man of the house whenever he ain't home.
Now the statues on the side of that big gate
They're laughing as I drive away
And I can't keep from thinking
Are they laughing at your old man or at me
And the only part that I don't like to play
Is the part when I get up and go away
I find it mighty hard
Just keeping this old heart tucked away.
'Cause he stays so busy with his money
And you, you get so lonely when he's gone
And me, I'm just your temporary lover
'Til your blues are gone
I'm the man of the house whenever he ain't home.
I'm the man of the house
When your other man ain't home...
Down the drain pipe, cross the yard and through the fence
I risked a whoopin' every time I went
'Cause white boys weren't allowed on the colored side of town
But I was proud to call that old black man my friend.
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on
I knew where my fingers went from his greasy fingerprints
Yeah, he was passin' on what was handed down to him.
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars 
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart 
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar, a ghost in this guitar.
Well, the night before he died he made me take it
He said, "You play it now, 'cause I gotta go" 
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it 
'Cause sometimes I'm in control and sometimes 
I just sit back and let him go, Sit back and let him go.
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars 
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart 
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar, a ghost in this guitar.
Take a listen to the ghost in this guitar...
Yeah, yeah 
Ooh it's a love thing 
I been working all day long 
And I'm ready to come on home to you 
All the other guys roll their eyes 
And don't realize it's what I want to do 
It's what I want to do 
They say I'm wrapped around your finger 
But they don't understand 
That what we got is more than just a diamond 
On your hand 
Baby it's a love thing, whoa 
Baby it's a love thing, yeah 
Sure I could hang around and complain about 
The way things ought to be 
Yeah there's trouble in the world 
But you're the girl 
Whose open arms are all I really need 
And that's why I come runnin' 
To be there by your side 
To let 'em call me crazy 
But it can't be denied 
Baby it's a love thing, whoa 
Baby it's a love thing, yeah 
And it's not about the same last name 
It's not a thing that can be explained 
It's how you make me feel inside 
And the way you hold me everynight 
It's a love thing, whoa 
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah 
He we go now 
It's a love thing 
They say I'm wrapped around your finger 
But they don't understand 
That what we got is more than just a diamond 
On your hand 
Baby it's a love thing, whoa 
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah 
Come on it's a love thing, whoa 
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah 
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa 
Oh sugar, it's a love thing 
No it ain't about no diamond ring 
It's a love thing, whoa 
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah 
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing
I'm gonna kick off my shoes 
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt 
And the gravel all meet
I'm going back to the well
Gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul
Where the blacktop ends
I'm looking down the barrel of Friday night 
I'm riding on a river of freeway lights
Look out city I'm country bound
'Til Monday rolls around
I'm gonna kick off my shoes 
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt 
And the gravel all meet
I'm going back to the well
Gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul
Where the blacktop ends
Working in the grind is an uphill road
I'm punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me
I'm gonna kick off my shoes 
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt 
And the gravel all meet
I'm going back to the well
Gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul
Where the blacktop ends
So come on
Give me some fresh air 
Give me that farm
And give me some time
With you in my arms
Far away from the hustle
And the pressure and the noise
I'm gonna kick off my shoes 
And run in bare feet
Where the grass, the dirt, 
The gravel all meet
I'm goin' back to the well
Gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul
You betcha
Ya I'm gonna kick off my shoes 
And run in bare feet 
Where the grass and the dirt
And the gravel all meet
I'm going back to the well 
Gonna visit old friends 
And feed my soul
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends...
I can hear the neighbors
They're arguin' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shoutin' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer.
But for the grace of God, go I
I must of been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God.
I can see that old man
He's walkin' past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone, it never riings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do
But for the grace of God, go I
I must of been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God.
Whoa, hmm
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracin' me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God, yeah.
I'd be lost but for the grace of God, yeah.
Ooh, woh...
It brings back an old feeling
Running into you like this
I'm really not afraid of hurting
But I can't stand the awkwardness
Do I laugh
Do I cry
Do I dare look in your eyes
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you
You seem to be a bit distracted
I wish that I could feel the same
You never were too good at acting
Baby some things never change
I can't keep from letting go
It's something that I can't control
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you
You stand there looking sweet and innocent
But how can you be so cruel and confident
At my expense
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at...
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' blow
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Everytime I look at you
Oh yeah, every time I look at you
There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd I used to pull away
When she would kiss my face and touch my hair
She didn't care who saw
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
The sky is blue
But from where I stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What I wouldn't give if I could feel the familiar touch
Of her love holding me'again
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
Now to prove that I love her
I crawl on my knees
For the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
On Friday night when I see her out
Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There ain't a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is...
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad we want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
I'm gonna work my courage up
Tell her I'm in love
I'm in love a lot
She has my heart on a string
Like everything the girl has got
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year 
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got
If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else
Wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you.
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then
If it's Friday night,
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home 
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you
This time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone
On Sunday evening
And this is what he hear
If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have
Taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you
Well I caught my wife with another man 
And it cost me ninety nine 
On a prison farm in Georgia 
Close to the Florida line 
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend 
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease 
Taking care of Ol' Red
Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen 
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail 
He's a four legged tracking machine 
You can consider yourself mighty lucky 
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds 
But all these years that I've been here 
Ain't nobody got past Red
And the warden sang 
Come on somebody 
Why don't you run 
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern 
Get my gun 
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter 
To my cousin up in Tennessee 
Oh, and he brought down a blue tick hound 
She was pretty as she could be 
Well they penned her up in the swampland 
'Bout a mile just south of the gate 
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang 
Come on somebody 
Why don't you run 
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern 
Get my gun 
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night 
And so I kept him away for three or four days 
And waited till the time got right 
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun 
And I smiled when I heard 'em turn Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee 
And Ol' Red was headed south
And the warden sang 
Come on somebody 
Why don't you run 
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun 
Get my lantern 
Get my gun 
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out
I knew something was the matter
It really needed my attention
And I had planned to look into it someday
But I was busy making money
I wanted you to be proud of me
Now I wish I could turn the clock back someway
I thought there was time
I never thought that you would leave me
I always thought that I could find you
Somewhere near a phone to answer when I call
Now you have my full attention
Now you're all that I can think of
This is not what I expected at all
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
Are you even on this planet
Can you see these pretty flowers
Or am I standing here just talking to the wind
How I wish that I had told you
How I wish that I had shouted
I love you I love you I love you I love you back then
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
Now I love country music
And I guess I always will
But these days, when I turn on the radio
It's just not the same thrill
I like a song that gives me chill bumps
Now and then there's some that still do
But I'm fed up with the same old vanilla
Hey how about you
I'm tired of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Hey there Mr. Songwriter
Come and visit in my home
Then tell me about life being perfect
And love that goes on and on and on
Then ride with me in my old Bronco
Down to the factory for eight hours
Then let me introduce you to my supervisor
Then write me a song about sunshine and flowers
And the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
I want to hear a song about passion
I want to hear a song about sin
I want to hear a song about redemption
Yeah, sing me one of them
Tell me about a cowboy in Australia
Tell me about a prisoner in China
Tell me about some old stock car driver
Down in Orangeburg, South Carolina
Instead of...
The same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Same old
Same old
Same old...
There's a house that's a little run down
This city ain't never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up 7 children raised onlove
When life gets hard that's where we go
Daddy don't know a stranger a handshake and he's your friend
Oh and mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heart ace ends
Just a place made of nails and wood but it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call, that's what I call home
Daddy buildt it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road I get that feeling in my soul
I thank god some things still remain
Once I get myself through that ol' screen door
The world can't touch me anymore
Fires are burning, up the forests!
Down along the Amazon!
There's children starving in Guat'mala!
Their just barely hanging on!
And I pray, they'll find the answer!
That there's a Way, to right the wrong!
And Lord while you're listening could I mention, some troubles of my own!
I got problems, right here at home!
Vers:
A teenage boy, in Mississippi, brings his daddy's
Gun to school!
A little girl in New York city, buy's cocain for mama to use!
And I pray, they'll find the answer!
That there's a Way, to right the wrong!
And Lord while you're listening could I mention, some troubles of my own!
I got problems, right here at home!
My wife is crying, our baby's fighting! a battle that she may not win,
The doctors doing, All that he can!
God now it's all in your hands!
And I pray, they'll find the answer!
That there's a Way, to right the wrong!
Now I'm just one Man, a grain of sand!
And a troubled world I know!
But I got a problem, right here at home,
I got a problem, right here at home!
If I was a cloud, I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun, I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon, I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star, charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star
If I was your man, the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man, we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man
If I was a song, I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream, I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream
If I was your man, we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby
If I-I-I-I-I was your man
You would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man
And if we were love, we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love
If I was your man, sweet lovin' man
If I was your man
If I was your man
Yeah!
I hit the ground runnin' with the mornin' sun.
When a job needs doin', I get it done.
I show up early an' I go home late.
Everybody knows I pull my weight.
'Cause I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Well, baby I heard he done you wrong.
The goin' got tough an' got gone.
Well, he ain't here an' I ain't him.
An' even if the walls come fallin' in.
You know I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Yeah.
Baby, when your heart is achin',
Lean on me, my back ain't breakin'.
All I'm sayin' is:
I don't mind doin', 
A little heavy liftin'.
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Even when I'm hurtin',
I keep on workin'.
And as long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Honey, I ain't quittin',
I'm always givin',
My everything.
Yeah.
As long as I'm still alive an' kickin',
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'.
Yeah.
My brother said that I was rotten to the core.
I was the youngest child so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by the time I came along.
She'd laugh until she cried I could do no wrong.
She would always save me because I was her baby.
I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham. I Turned 21 in Cincinnati,
I called home to mom and daddy, I said Your boy is now a man.
She said I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby.
She loved that photograph of our whole family.
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
Ronnie with his 2 kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby.
I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana 
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you, 
She might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby.
She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin' 
By the time that I got to her side.
And I knew that she'd been taken and my heart it was breakin', 
I never got to say goodbye.
I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby...
The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbin' back behind the wheel
Of fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load
They need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night, unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
Sometimes, late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me
Where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair
And your kiss
Girl, that's what I miss
Still, I drive these horses
Through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night, unknown
On a ride that won't let me go
Asphalt Cowboy
Come on.
In my heaven there ain't no lawyers,
Don't need names on dotted lines
Folks do buisiness like they oughta
A good firm handshake works just fine
We feed lawyers to the lions.
In my heave there ain't no children
Totin' loaded guns to school
Ain't no such thing as peer pressure
Bein' who you are is cool
They still teach that golden rule.
In my heaven
We hurt no one
No lyin', cryin' nor dyin' young
No one's lonely
No one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven.
In my heaven I can sing like elvis
Play guitar like BB King
Slide a fast ball past Hank Aarron
Batter, batter, batter swing
I can do most anything.
--- Instrumental ---
In my heaven
We hurt no one
No lyin', cryin' nor dyin' young
No one's lonely
No one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven.
I know that it's god's decision
What my heavens gonna be
And I ain't tellin' him his business
But if he left it up to me.
Then in my heaven,
There's football with no referees
In my heaven
There's never been an injury
In my heaven
Angels yodel when they sing
In my heaven
Fish'll bite most anything
In my heaven.
In my heaven.
In my heaven...
Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're goin'
They leave a lot of good things behind
Guess you could call me a dreamer
And I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
And do all the things they tell me to
Yeah, I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last
Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
Oh yeah, whisper baby...
Grandpa's down
By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes
From the back
Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line
While sipping on
Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us
My Dad's got
A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam
But he's still down
At the sawmill every day
Oh, and first thing
'Fore the break of dawn
Mama's got his eggs
And coffee on
My whole life
It's been that way
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Just as sure as the river flows
We take care of our own
Step right up when someone needs a friend
Last year on the Johnson farm
A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build 'em back again, all right
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Yea...
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wonder through the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much you're missed?
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens for some saving grace
And I cry, dying without you
I know you're somewhere looking up there too
Right now that's all two distance hearts can do
At least where underneath, underneath the same moon.
Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear
Oh I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Oh hold on please
Won't you wait for me?
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens for some saving grace
And I cry, dying without you
I know you're somewhere looking up there too
Right now that's all two distance hearts can do
At least where underneath, underneath the same moon.
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around.
Mason jars on the dresser 
Filled with quaters and dollars 
Savin' 'em for our trip around the world 
But, now you've changed your tune 
There'll be no honemoon 
So tonight I'm going there without you, girl
I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of Tequilla
Going down to Puerto Rico in a bottle of Rum
Going out to Honolulu in a Mai Tai mug 
Then, I'm coming back home to Georgie in a jug.
We'll never ride that bus to Mexico City, it's a pity
We'll never sail our ship into Ol' San Juan,
You'll never walk with me
On the beach at Waikiki, and
We'll never share that brick suburban home 
Today I'm taking that money out of the jar 
Tonight I'll buy my ticket, down at the corner bar
I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of Tequilla
Going down to Puerto Rico in a bottle of Rum
Going out to Honolulu in a Mai Tai mug 
Then, I'm coming back home to Georgie in a jug
Then, I'm coming back home to Georgie in a jug...
This is a song
About best friends.
John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.
The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.
Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)
Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.
Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.
Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.
Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.
Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.
(And he was yellin',)
Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.
Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.
And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.
(He said.)
Doin' a little funny business
In Mexico, Amigo.
But all I could think about
Was savin' my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well, it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed.
(When you said,)
Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.
Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.
Ah, we're still best friends
Temporary cell-mates...
If time has no beginning and if time has no end
A billion years a trillion years, what then
Is infinity a circle an enternal loop
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Before we were babies there's nothing we recall
And when we go back will it fade to black
And that's all or could we be destined
For some other time and place
And have we lived other lives
Our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Will we see Jesus comin'
As the sunshine fills the night
Or when we die will we
Fly into the light
Will we all be reunited
With the ones who've gone away
And will we love each other
The way we do today
I beleieve someday well know all about it
And have no reason to doubt it
Someday
(I beleieve someday well know all about it)
(Someday...) ...
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign-car-driving dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breeze is blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
I circled the parking lot
Trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar
Was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in
Some beach, somewhere 
There's nowhere to go when you've got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot senoritas
Smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere
Well, I sat in that waiting room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said Doc's ready for you
Your not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novacaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb
Some beach, somewhere
There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere
Don't waste your time looking over your shoulder
Those loves from the past ain't getting no closer
When I look in my future you're all I can see
Don't go loving on nobody but me.
Nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to, but I'm asking pretty please (Honey) Don't go loving on nobody but me.
I took my time to tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long don't mean that it isn't real
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees
Don't go loving on nobody but me.
Nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to, but I'm asking pretty please (Honey) Don't go loving on nobody but me.
Nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to, but I'm asking pretty please (Honey) Don't go loving on nobody but me.
Don't go loving on nobody but me...
Baby baby baby
He's got you cryin' again
Baby baby baby
He's got you cryin' again
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
He kicks off his shoes throws down this coat
Opens a beer grabs the remote
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby
Why don't you just get rid of him (Tell him to go)
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend. (That's right)
He makes you cry I'll make you laugh
He rubs you wrong I'll rub your back
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby
Why don't you just get rid of him (Bye Bubba)
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
Good Old Boy Bad Old Boyfriend.
Little by little, now babe
I've come a long, long way
Picking up the pieces
That you threw away
Did you give it up
Did I let you down
Either way, it doesn't matter
'Cause I'm finally comin' 'round
I hope you find where you belong
Hello, goodbye, life goes on.
In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But I could never let her stay
'Cause love, your sweet love
Still gets in the way.
Minute by minute
I hear the voice in my heart
Be a man, take her hand
And make a new start
So, I think a little less
I drink a little more
'Cause all in all she's everything
That I've been waiting for
She smiles that smile
I face the fact
Love's a give a take thing
And I can't give it back.
In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But I could never let her stay
'Cause love, your sweet love
Still gets in the way.
--- Intrumental ---
In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But I could never let her stay
'Cause love, your sweet love
Still gets in the way
It's your life; you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything?
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away; don't I matter anymore?
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well, it's been fun; what else can I say?
If the feeling's gone, words won't stop you anyway
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
Goodbye, baby
On a Mississippi mornin'
My dad yelled out a warnin'
Son you better hit that cotton patch soon
And on my way on down the field
As I passed Old Johnson's Mill
I saw Becky Morgan, skinny dippin' nude.
Well I couldn't help but stop and stare
Hypnotized I stood right there
Enchanted by the beauty that I'd seen
Then she gave me a come here smile
Nearly drove my body wild
I fell down tryin' to kick off my jeans.
Well on that cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Beck Morgan
You know that day I didn't get to work on time
And in the days of my December
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
Well I lost my job that summer
But I guess I had it comin'
Cause that pickin' cotton just wasn't on my mind
But you don't need too much money
When you got a Tupelo honey
Keepin' you cool in the Mississippi hot sunshine.

And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Becky Morgan
The whole dang I never got to work on time
And in the days of my December
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
We've come along way since then
Now I own that cotton gin
And I bought that mill
Just to make her smile
And to keep our love from growin' old
We still go down there to that hole
Skinny dip and Becky is just as wild.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I wake up with Becky Morgan
And to this day I never got to work on time
And in the days of our December
I know we'll both remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
(2x)
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time 
Honey you are so persuasive 
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind 
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
But keep on asking if you're inclined
But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind
Tommy's daddy kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough to do what daddy's did.
It didn't take us long to go from drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house I stumbled just a bit.
You play it cool but its no use,
Dad ain't no fool and that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
We lost daddy in 1999
I took care of everybody's pain, except for mine,
Then one night my wife took my face in her hands
She said, 'I think its time you cry for your old man.'
You play it cool but its no use
She ain't no fool and that's the truth
And my tear drops finally fell,
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
I could probably do more to help my fellow man,
But life gets busy and I hope God understands
Someday when I get time, I'll do more than my share,
Funny how I'm thinkin' it sittin' in my easy chair,
You play it cool but its no use,
God ain't no fool and that's the truth,
And he won't let you fool yourself,
You can't hide one single thought,
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
When somebody knows you that well...
On a good day when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm gonna be okay
But as you can plainly see I'm not havin' on a good day.
So set 'em up
Here's a hundred dollars, keep 'em comin' Joe (whoa, whoa)
When I've had enough call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man
That even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see I'm not havin' on a good day.
On a good day I would never crash a party
Knowin' she's be there with someone else
And on a good day I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
And on a good day I'd be quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see I'm not havin' on a good day.
Yeah, I only see you Joe
When I'm not havin' a good day
No, I'm not havin' a good day
Mr. Bourbon and Coke laughs
At all of my jokes when he's drinking
Mr. Martini stares and he
Never shares what he's thinking.
Miss Sexy Red Wine tells me at closing time
That she'll phone me
Mr. Whiskey Shot Glass watches hookers
Walk past when he's lonely.
I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender.
Mr. Never Does Tip says
That none of his kids ever call home
Mrs. Chews On Her Lip tells someone
She's at work on her cell phone.
Mrs. Husband Just Died always
Breaks down and cries on the weekends
Just another long night in a
Bartender's life with some good friends.
I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender.
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender...
Highway 65 sure sounds kinda nice
I feel like drivin' somewhere far away
Got the top rolled down, radio up loud
Playin' Willie and Old Hank
Well I don't really have a certain destination
I'll just fill the gas tank up and use my imagination
I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while
Sometimes we're afraid to change, scared of what tomorrow brings
Same routine every day
If you never stop and listen, you don't know what you'll be missin'
Don't let your life slip away
I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out, 'cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while
I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out, 'cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while
Stay up all night and sleep all day and wake up with a smile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while
Well they say there's lots of fans
For those Texas country bands
Playing all them songs about Texas pride
Well you can make one little bet
I ain't seen my fan club yet
But I'm hell bent for gettin' them on my side
I sing the eyes of Texas
Make my home on the range
And I shout out T for Texas every hour
I've been drowned in Whiskey River and I've played down at the La Grange
And the rose of San Antone is my favorite flower
I saw Robert Earl Keen
At the dance hall down in green
He said the party never ends down aggy way
Yeah and Dallas has their show with old David Allen Coe
He never even called me by my name
Well I can rope a steer
Drink a keg of Lonestar beer
I got three pet armadillos and a pick up truck
I got a redneck for a mother
And I'm here to tell you brother
If you ain't born in Texas then you're out of luck
'Cause them people down in Texas don't give a dog-gone if
You ain't born in Texas then you better go home
I love you, more than you'll ever know.
And I miss you, more than I care to show.
I'll get better at pretending nothing's wrong.
It's easy, when you're always all alone.
Lately, I see leavin' in your eyes.
So nothing you say, will come as a surprise.
You don't even have to try to be sincere.
Just go on, and leave me lyin' here.
And I'll tell my heart,
You didn't cause it to break.
And I'll tell my mind,
That I'm the one that made the mistake.
And I'll tell my eyes,
They don't even have to cry one tear.
Just go on and leave me lyin' here.
So go on, and find you someone new.
I'll make sure that I end the fool.
And maybe someday, I'll begin to make it clear.
You're the one who left me lyin' here.
And I'll tell my heart,
You didn't cause it to break.
And I'll tell my mind,
That I'm the one that made the mistake.
And I'll tell my eyes,
They don't even have to cry one tear.
Just go on and leave me lyin' here.
Just walk away and leave me lyin' here.
Well, you walked into my heart like it was some old dance hall floor
I should have known better; I had seen your kind before
You rolled in like a tumble weed the Texas wind had blown
And I feel another heartache coming on
There's no doubt about it darlin'; you're the hurtin' kind
Like all those other memories branded on my mind
I fell right into this one; you were coming on so strong
And I feel another heartache comin' on
Well, it's a shame you couldn't keep those promises you made to me
Tellin' me you would never do me wrong
Another lesson I will learn
Another bridge that I will burn
You're just another heartache comin' on
Well, I guess I'll learn the hard way, darlin', love is just a curse
There's no sense in crying; it will only make it worse
So we'll go on our separate ways and I'll be fine alone
Until I feel another heartache comin' on
Until another heartache comes along
What in the world is happening to me
I've already tried to shake your memory
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
'Cause honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
You told me that your love would heal my broken heart
So I let you in my world and you tore it all apart
What in the world is happening to me
I've already tried to shake your memory
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
'Cause honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
I should have known you weren't the kind to ever settle down
Always leaving me alone while you did your runnin' 'round
Oh tell me what in the world did you do to me
I'm sick and tired of trying to shake your memory
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
'Cause honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
Daddy always said he was wrong for me
And in the end he'd only bring me misery
I tried and tried to turn away, but something 'bout him makes me stay
The only man who's ever knocked me to my knees
The only man who's ever set my spirit free
He was born and raised in Lynchburg, Tennessee
His daddy owns a big distillery
He's an old time wiskey drinker, when I'm with him I get meaner
And momma says he's ruined my destiny
He sure has made a women out of me
I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
Hes the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please, he always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
(Instrumtal Break)
I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
He's the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please, he always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been that didn't do me wrong
Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain, its drivin' me insane, since my baby's gone
I'm Texas as hell
Mean 'n' ornery
I don't need no loud mouth
Comin' on to me
My temper gets hotter than red, white and blue blazes
You know dog-gone well everybody can tell I'm Texas as hell
Well, I know I haven't been around a long time
But I've heard my share of
Those worn out love lines
If you ain't redneck
Don't waste your time
Because right now I'm in a lonestar state of mind
And I'm Texas as hell
Mean 'n' ornery
I don't need no loud mouth
Comin' on to me
My temper gets hotter than red, white and blue blazes
You know dog-gone well everybody can tell
I'm Texas as hell
Well I guess you think that I'll be persuaded
But how many times do I have to say this
Don't mess with me boy
For heaven's sake
Didn't anybody tell you messin' with Texas was a big mistake
'Cause I'm Texas as hell
I'm mean 'n' ornery
I don't need no loud mouth comin' on to me
My temper gets hotter than red white and blue blazes
You know dog-gone well everybody can tell
I'm Texas as hell
You know dog-gone well everybody can tell I'm Texas as hell
Well, there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
Whiskey drinkin' cowboys and lonesome country songs
Wonderin' if I'll fall in love or if I won't
Well, there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
Guess that all my life I've been a-runnin' round
Playin' all the honky tonks from town to town
I'm just not the kind to ever settle down
And a honky tonk's the only love I've ever found
There's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
Whiskey drinkin' cowboys and lonesome country songs
Wonderin' if I'll fall in love or if I won't
Well, there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
Well, I've had my share of dancin' partners, that's for sure
But I've never two-stepped my way into love before
But every night you'll see me crawlin' back for more
'Cause I just can't seem to stay away from swingin' doors
Well, there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
There's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
Whiskey drinkin' cowboys and lonesome country songs
Wonderin' if I'll fall in love or if I won't
Well, there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
There's somethin' that I like
About those neon lights
Used to stay for hours, and listen to the rain
You'd hold me on the porch swing
While our troubles washed away
And Daddy'd come and get me
"Girl, it's time to come inside"
And I'd say, "Just a few more minutes
Daddy please, we need a little time
To say our last good-bye"
Time flew by so quickly, and our love slowly died
We both knew that we had grown apart, neither one knew why
Told me you'd come back when, you'd made up your mind
Now all those memories faded, all except the night
You said your last good-bye
I know you needed time to find yourself
But I can't keep my heart upon that shelf
Boy it's been awhile now, since I heard your voice
I didn't want to call you, but my heart left me no choice
I just called to tell you, that I'm really doing fine
That I been doing lots of thinkin'
And I finally decided it was time
To say my last good-bye
Ooh, good-bye, good-bye
Alone in a booth, in the Pioneer Cafe
I'm strung out from the road, a pillow in my hands
I sip the last straw from a cold cup of coffee
And try to sort out my feelings as good as I can
Two hours behind me, there's a boy back in Dallas
My phone will be ringing his afternoon call
But he'll get no answer; the queen's left her palace
She's alone in a cafe in Witchita Falls
Back out on the highway towards Oklahoma
I'm driving and crying and hating it all
This old Chevrolet is raising the sunset
And taking me further from Witchita Falls
I don't know where I'm going; I have no direction
And all I can say is I've made up my mind
I just want to travel a long way from heartache
Wherever it takes me, I'll leave it behind
I guess that he thought I would stay there forever
Living my life with my back to the wall
Well, maybe the waitress will send him that letter
I left on the table in Witchita Falls
I'm going somewhere other than Texas
A long way from Dallas in Witchita Falls
I'm taking the highway, yeah I'm going somewhere
I'm waitin' on the sun to set cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes, there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walking, spinning tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it's too long, livin' like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheating really ain't a crime
I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
Forget your high society, I'm soakin' it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach 'em what they need to learn HA!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin', ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
Now I don't hate the one who left, you can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holding on to someone, I'm holding up my smoking gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me
Well I'm giving up on love HEY love's given up on me
You draw it out like a highway
With every word that you say
Excuses for the answers that you lack
Your mama's still the steady ground you walk on every day
And your daddy's still the monkey on your back
Did you find all you thought you'd find out in the wild, wild west
You took a little piece of home and you threw away the rest
You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
Hey what about Georgia
Saw your sister yesterday
Austin's five and on his way
Looking for some shoes that he can fill
He said that he'd be just like you, the coolest guy he ever knew
And he'd find you when he lost his training wheels
I looked in his big blue eyes and I saw you again
He's hungry for a life that he ain't ready to begin
You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
So what about Georgia
Guess you didn't realize it'd take you quite this long
To figure out that being free is right where you belong
You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up
HEY! Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33
Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun
Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son
She's at home and she's been praying for you
Hey want about Georgia
What about Georgia yeah
What about Georgia Georgia, yeah
What about Georgia
Rain on the window makes me lonely
And time keeps on passing so slowly
The old man sitting next to me is falling asleep
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere
The sun's going down on my misery
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That telephone I hear ringing, I keep wishing it was you
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere
That ring that you were wearing, don't mean everything
And the way that you stood staring, as you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me, but there's some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
And I'm gonna find some place I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride
Rain on the window and I'm still lonely
And time keeps on passing so slowly
You're with her and I'm alone, and you're wishing I was there
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
We're all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go
Oh...
The Texas sky is the biggest one I've ever seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad,
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams
I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
Drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas
And an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got an old guitar and a brand new set of strings
Mama said I never should have done it
I should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there
And he smiled inside and I pretended that I
Didn't notice a little tear that fell when I said I was going
I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
Drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas
And an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got an old guitar and a brand new set of strings
I've worried about life and
If it's right and right in time
I guess if you don't jump
You'll never know if you can fly
I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore
It's not like I don't have tears to cry
Such memories so little time
This box of photographs to go through one by one
There's just so much work to get done 
I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore
When you skipped town I was such a mess
So I found some things to do instead
Trick is to find something to occupy your mind
Now I spend most days chasin' mine
And I can't be bothered to miss you anymore
Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four
I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure
I can't be bothered now to miss you, I'm cuddling up to kiss you
And I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore
Sweet like a kiss sharp like a razor blade
I find you when I' m close to the bottom
You can't appreciate the time it takes
To kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong
And as I'm putting out the flame
Somebody brings up you name
Oh oh oh oh
Baby baby baby bring me down
I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart
Six AM unruffled pillow
Laughs out loud at my trusting heart
It's like I didn't see the penny
I missed the fountain by a couple yards
If you would only stay gone
Maybe I could move on
Oh oh oh oh
Baby baby baby bring me down
I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart
OH! Baby baby baby bring me down
I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart
OH! Baby baby baby bring me down
I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart
Bring me down...
Me and Charlie boy used to go walking, sittin' in the woods behind my house
Being lovers meant a stolen kiss and holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married but we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run down like so many do these days
So we treat our love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top; run like hell to show it off
Oh promises were made when we'd go walkin'; that's just me and Charlie talking
Charlie always said he'd like to leave here; turned eighteen and left our sleepy town 
Letters came and went and I kept waiting for Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
It's funny how time and distance change you. The road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions, and you look up and it's gone
So we treat our love like a firefly like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top; run like hell to show it off
Oh the promises we made when we were walking; that's just me and Charlie talking
Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie and how we thought we new it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again
So we treat our love like a fire Fly like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top; run like hell to show it off
Oh the promises were made when we were walking; that's just me and Charlie talking
You know it's so complicated, first you love then you hate it
Someone's laughing, someone's crying, someone livin', someone's dying
Sombody always loses and we still play the game
And the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, 'cause I ain't gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die
You always say that you love me and there is no one above me
Never giving, always takin', never bending, always breaking
I know you ain't a liar, but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin' on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die
Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player, but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools
Yeah, it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing, you're crying, you're livin', I'm dyin'
Somebody always looses and we still play the game
Yeah, the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, 'cause I ain't gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die
Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools
Yeah, it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing, you're crying, I'm living, you're dyin'
I know you ain't a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin' on' a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die
Oh, I wanna die
Tear it up, tear it up
Um um um
Baby, you're just jaded
From some nobody's unforgotten words
Baby, You're just fadin
A little grey from every time that you've been hurt
So you're looking for your skin
That you never did fit in
You can't hide when you're turned inside out
Love is lookin' for you now
Baby, You've been burnin
But you can't blow out a flame that you can't find
Baby, you've been thirstin
But the rain just ain't enough when you're this dry
So you're runnin' from the water
And the fire's gettin' hotter

I think you better find some level ground
Love is lookin' for you now
Baby you've been wearin
The shoes that someone else is wearin now
Baby, you've been swearin
That forever might have already run out
You can't love yourself
At the expense of someone else
You can't hide a lier from the truth
Love is lookin' for you
Love is lookin' for you
I've been lookin' for you
Baby I've been lookin' yeah
Well the sun just got through going down on a sleepy little Texas town
Population plus one minus one
A new grandma rocks my sister's kid just like twenty years ago she did
The same thing in that same chair
She said "this one's born to run?
Every day at noon like a chapel bell find her Jesus keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong at the end of the day
I got 5 good years and a tank of gas, fifty watts and Johnny Cash
A guitar and a broken heart just full of things to say
You taught me how to stand those tests and trials
But you can't se a desert sunrise in the bible
She loves me more that anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped off in El Paso
And her north in Abilene
Mama I'm OK out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
If I'd have done what you and daddy done, would have never lost and never won
Or gotten myself kicked when I was down
I would not know how to travel well, A hundred bucks and cheap motels
I would not know how to fight for my own heart next time around
Now don't you cry another night about me
In this city I've got angels all around me
She loves me more that anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped off in El Paso
And her north in Abilene
Hey Mama I'm OK out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed Id be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I felt it every time you prayed for me
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I'd run away but I can't escape the power of your pride
Your eyes are cold like an empty soul and I'm burning up inside
There's nothing wrong with letting go and you're still diggin' in
We're racing to the bottom and I' can't find the end
And there's a wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break 'cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there a wall
You love me when you want to and you find reasons to fight
Another lame excuse to keep the devil on you side
Trying hard to hide those scares that I've already seen
Your beat up heart's not the only thing that's keeping you from me
And there's a wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break 'cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there a wall
Pain has made you weak and hard
I will never be as strong,
As strong...
As this wall
Standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger
You won't break 'cause you're afraid you'll fall
With this wall
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
I can't handle all this pain
All we ever do is fight anyway
Why we even tried I haven't a clue
With hearts involved there's way too much to lose
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
You were something else to look at
Your intentions they weren't' all bad
You tried to make me something I wasn't
Lord knows there ain't no future in all that
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
County road 233, under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ole me
I've got two miles till he makes bail
And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
Well it's half past ten, another six pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
His fist is big but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and 
Gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead
Well, the road was hot and flat as a ruler
Good hundred miles between me and Missoula
That vinyl top wasn't gettin' no cooler
I stopped at a Quickie Sack
Well, I figured I'd need about a six of Miller
And one of those things so I wouldn't spill 'er
And I asked the girl if the beer was in the back
She said
"It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town"
So I turn right around, no hesitation
Cursed the laws for ruinin' the nation
Waved goodbye to the boy at the station
But she wouldn't go in gear
He said it sounds like your transmission
You need Bob, but he's gone fishin'
On his day off, he gets a long way from here
'Cause
It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town
Well, back home friends you can get a dose of
Something strong from your local grocer
So I walked down till I got a little closer
To a place called Happy John's
He said I keep something here for colds and fevers
Down underneath's where I usually leave her
But just last night I felt a cold comin' on
It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town
I'd need a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town
They say life is so much sweeter
Through the telephoto lens of fame
Around here you get just as much attention
Cheerin' at the high school football game
I dreamed of goin' to Nashville
Put my money down and placed my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page of the Turnertown Gazette
Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows ya just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Tyler and Casey broke up
It ended pretty quietly
We heard he was caught red-handed with her mama
So that's just what they let us all believe
Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows ya just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Baby who
Needs their faces in a magazine
Me and you
We've been stars of the town since we were seventeen
Let's go on down to the quick stop
Wear your yellow shades
And I'll put on my tight jeans
And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber
And we'll let 'em point and stare in disbelief
Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows ya just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Well It took me 5 bars, some 30 license plates
I saw her mustang
And my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol but I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in bare-handed
She was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do
She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex girlfriend
I watched her for awhile but I didn't like her walk
She came across kinda cheap to me
But, hey, how's that my fault
She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl
To step up to the plate
I wanna pitch
(Little Bitch)
Well them pretty girls, they're all the same
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I started throwing things and I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face smelled whiskey on his breath
Didn't give a second thought to being thrown in jail
Cause baby to a hammer everything lookes like a nail
I was mad as hell
Them pretty girls, they're all the same
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
Love letters on wet paper
For givers and no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the sign says no vacancy
He's broken my heart for the last time
You promise the truth and you told lies
You really made me believe that love was supposed to be free
Love letters on wet paper
For givers and no takers
An angel who never got wins
They find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the sign says no vacancy
I never forget how he used to be
But I'm better off living with memories
I know that it's gonna hurt but I don't think it gets any worse
Love letters on wet paper
For givers and no takers
An angel who never got wins
They find Jesus and it's too late
He's already closed the front gate
And the sign says no vacancy
Throw a dog a bone, I'll take it if I have to
Go real fast like there's somewhere we can get to
What's the use of standing right on the edge if there's no where to fall
What's the use of holdin' on tight to the phone if nobody might call
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
Complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you
Tell it like a lie, live it like a movie
Give a heart away like it don't mean nothin' to me
What's the use of making all the plans that we made if you weren't gonna go
What's the use of slapping on a smile for a face if your eyes don't wanna show
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
Complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you
Well it's too damn bad you didn't have a chance to make me your best friend
You were too caught up in giving too much up and not doing what you should have been
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
Complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you
She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
Guess I should've been more like that
You had it all for a pretty little while
And some how you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
Then you realized you wanted what you had
I guess I should've been more like that
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserverd

I guess I should've been more like her
Forgiving you, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
It's plain to see desperatio showed itn's truth
You love her and she loves you with all she has
I guess I should've been more like that
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserverd
I guess I should've been more like her
She's beautiful in her simple, little way
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
Strong man lived like a jackson hole
Took my heart and broke my soul
Left a dark place in my chest
I sleep but I don't rest
I sleep but I don't rest
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
Met a boy in Baton Rouge
Eyes were clear and his heart was true
Made the boy's heart scream my name
But he didn't know the game
But he didn't know the game
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
You don't want to be standin' there
When the storm hits you won't have a prayer
My wind will blow you to your knee
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
She was pretty, 'bout 17
When She moved in down my street
Still don't know what she saw in me
I guess she like the way I made her laugh
She wanted more than what friends have
She kissed me once and we never looked back
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Don't stop, darling they're just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath, the only sound
Baby, darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
In the woods in my Grandpa's barn
In The Backseat of my car
She said, it doesn't matter where we are
She made me thirst for a woman's love
I kept drinking, couldn't get enough
Yeah, there was magic in her velvet touch
First time was down by the river
Our Sweat made both us shiver
Don't stop, darling they're just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath, the only sound
Baby, darling she said take me
And Drive me crazy
The leaves changed and the sky turned grey
Her Daddy's job took her away
I can still see the tears rolling down her face
Oh, Yeah
First time was down by the river
Our sweat made both us shiver
Don't stop, darling they're just raindrops
The moonlight was all around
Our breath, the only sound
Baby, darling she said take me
And drive me crazy
Baby, drive me crazy
When the lights go down
When you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio
And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket
So Come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, Tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around
In a field, where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail
So come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
So Come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little bit of beer money
Tonight, tonight
Baby, we're drinkin';
Lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
So come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on
Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night
Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl, in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a man
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
And there's somethin' 'bout a kiss, that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Somethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 a.m.
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
I Bet you're wonderin' where I've been
What town I'm calling home for now
And just how long I'll be there before I turn around
Truth is I've finally found the place
Where I can start to plant some roots
It's about as close to being perfect, it's got everything but you
There's a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
It's got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind 'em
And there's a sun out here that seems to always shine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you
There's a taco stand right down the corner
Serves the best cold draft beer
Sometimes I order up a round, pretend you're right here
An a reggae band plays every Friday
We drink and dance into the night
Most Folks 'round here think I'm a local and
I'd say that that's about right, yeah, that's about right
There's a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
It's got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind 'em
And there's a sun out here that seems to always shine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you
And that's everything to me
You, the only thing I need, yeah
There's a pathway to the ocean, a salty breeze blowing
And this old man down the street makes damn good wine
And I've never seen water quite so blue
No, I ain't never seen water quite so blue
It's got everything but you, yeah
Come on out Mary Jane I'm looking through your window pane.
I heard the word, you're back in town.
I got some cheap cigarettes, your favorite beer,
Girl wear the dress I always dream about.
We'll chase the moon, ride the stars,
Find the muscle in this car, I know we've still got something left.
So come on out take my hand feel my heart
Girl understand I've got a thunder pounding in my chest.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
And girl tonight let's go crazy one more time.
We'll park the car, climb the hood turn it up when something good
Starts playing through these rusty doors.
In the sticky sweet air tonight, I'll kiss you girl till I get it right
'Cause I know, that'll lead to more.
The weeds have all grown around where I gently lay you down
And I try to tell you how I feel.
But you'll place your finger on my mouth, whisper "baby, no not now".
The night is young and we still got time to steal.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
Girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time.
With the engine burning through my jeans, I watch you fall
Fast asleep and this small town sky, fade from black to blue.
And I wipe a tear from my eye but you'll never know
Cause baby I'll smile, as I wave goodbye to you.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
And girl tonight let's go crazy one more time.
Hey I, can't see you as nothing but mine.
Girl tonight, let's go crazy one more time.
I guess I'll always have this longing in my heart,
And you'll have a piece of me.
But tonight there's a fire to start in our red, burning hearts
And you're all that I'll ever need.
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking, drinking, and smoking
And hoping that it's me that's floating through your mind, floating through your mind
Then I get that feeling, trying to stop my hands from shaking,
Staring at the ceiling, and kneeling, and making deals with the man above
Yeah, with the man above
Oh, I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight
I wring the sheets out when I'm sweating,
Soaking wet, pacing, chasing the visions
And wishing that I could kiss,
Instead of missing you,
Can't catch my breath, kinda feels like I'm suffocating, my mind's a wreck
At best, I think my heart is breaking down on me, breaking down on me
Oh, I, I I'm wondering where you are tonight
I, I, tell me will we ever get it right
I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight
Can you feel me when I reach for you
Hear me when I say Your name
See me walking through your door
Or are we just too far away
Too Far away
Tell me when I'm out of sight, am I out of mind,
Do you count the seconds and minutes, just wanna speed up time
Girl, are you missing me all the ways I'm missing you,
Could you tell me how the hell I'm suppose to make it through?
Oh, I, I I'm wondering where you are tonight
I, I, tell me will we ever get it right
I, I, I'm wondering where you are tonight
Wondering where you are tonight
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking, drinking and smoking
And Hoping
I wring the sheets out when I'm sweating,
Soaking wet, pacing, chasing the visions and wishing
Can't catch my breath, kinda feels like I'm suffocating, my mind's a wreck
At best, I think my heart is breaking down on me
D-d-down on me
Wondering where you are tonight
Wondering where you are tonight
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Love's in the air tonight
You can bet you make this ol' boy's day
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make you mine there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think
Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home
My momma's gonna love you
She'll make me sleep on the couch, I know
Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home
Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams
And a house on a piece of land
We'll plant some roots and some apple trees
Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams
Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
Happiness don't drag its feet
And time moves faster than you think
Hey pretty girl, you did so good
Our baby's got your eyes
And a fighter's heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl, you did so good
Hey pretty girl, when I see the light
And it's my time to go
I'm gonna thank the Lord for a real good life
A pretty little girl and a beautiful wife
I spent a summer down south, working for the county, trying to save for school
I blew it all like a damn fool on women and beer
I didn't have the grades but I had myself a major league fastball
Got a call from the minor leagues in Wichita and blew out my arm in the first year, ha-ha, yeah
Well, I took a good look at my life and decided I'd make a change
Booked me a flight on an airplane, I was 3rd world Peace Corps bound
But I met me a stewardess right there in the airport bar
Before I knew it I was in her car and never turned around
Well, maybe I'm reckless, maybe bad luck, hell maybe I'm way too much about having fun
I'll send you a postcard, send me your love, just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up
I went to work for my uncle on the coast called the hot spot
We took our breaks on the boat docks and I got fired for smoking pot
With the beach right there I guess surfing was the logical next move
But I got mouthy with the wrong dude and got my damn jaw tattooed
Well, maybe I'm reckless, maybe bad luck, hell maybe I'm way too much about having fun
I'll send you a postcard, send me your love, just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up
All right
I bought an old guitar with cash from a good hand of blackjack
Learned a few chords from a fat-back, hairy man named Pete
I got a local gig on the weekends in some old honky-tonk
Singing 2 hours of nothing but Cash songs, and I could always drink for free
And some so called big-wig, producer man started sniffing 'round
He told me he liked my sound but there was something holding me back
He said a rhinestone suit and a cowboy hat outta do the trick
I told him I had something he could stick, way on up his ass
Well, maybe I'm reckless, maybe bad luck, hell maybe I'm way too much about having fun
I'll send you a postcard, send me your love, just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up
I'll send you a post card, send me your love, just don't give up on me yet, I'm still growing up
All right
But don't give up on me yet
I know I might take a little time
But I'm gonna come around
I just feel Like I still got a few things I gotta Get out of my system, ha ha
I know the lights are out, I know it's getting late
But You're Still Young and we're wide awake
I've never seen a sky this damn bright
So don't' go home, it just ain't right
I Got a Good idea, I got a wild hair
There's a little spot and we could meet you there
Take the only road straight outta town
Until you see the fire, baby don't slow down
'Cause we'll be up all night
Keeping up the moon
I Just wanna dance, baby dance with you
We gonna scream and shout until sunrise
We won't close it down
We'll be up all night
Baby, grab some beers and we'll grab guitars
Tell all your friends and we'll ride the stars
We'll gas the fire, try to make it last
And we'll sing it up and you can shake your sss
'Cause we'll be up all night
Keeping up the moon
I Just wanna dance, baby dance with you
We gonna scream and shout until sunrise
We won't close it down
We'll be up all night

Don't Want Nobody, No, Not This Time
Find me a place where I can park my truck
Hop on the hood, gonna light one up
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, um
I'll check the sights on my 22
Take a couple pot shots at the moon
Now that you're gone there's nothing to lose
I'll think it's time I forget about you
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, um
I'm gonna say goodbye to you tonight
So long old friend
I'm gonna fly again
Pour me a shot of my real good friend
Take me a breath and I'll do it again
Count all my smoke rings in the dark
Ain't gonna worry 'bout where you are
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, um
Once I've finally caught my buzz
I won't give a damn and I'll roll one up
Grab my guitar, pick a song or two
One of them song where I forget about you
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, um
I'm gonna say goodbye to you tonight
So long old friend
I'm gonna fly again
Girl, it hurts, I ain't gonna lie
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna cry
It's an end and long overdue
Forget about love girl, forget about you
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, um
I'm gonna say goodbye to you tonight
So long old friend
I'm gonna fly again
I'm gonna say goodbye to you tonight
So long old friend
I'm gonna fly again
Baby, I can't wait to get this thing started
A sky full of moon and a million crazy little things to do
Let's throw a little after party
Baby, just me and you
Well the night's still young and baby so are we
There's just one place where you need to be
Let's throw a little after party
A candle on the tailgate
Baby, I can't wait to get this thing started
A sky full of moon and a million crazy little things to do
Let's throw a little after party
Baby, just me and you
Let's throw a little after party
Oh baby, just me and you
It ain't in a high rise looking for a good time shutting down the city lights
It ain't in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain't where it is
It's at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
It ain't in a souped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain't to my right
It ain't in a dive bar, tall can of PBR, poppin' tops rockin' all night
As good as it gets, no that ain't where it is
It's at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
No, it don't matter wherever we're at (No)
No, it don't get no better than that
It ain't in a souped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain't to my right
It's at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that's where
Yep yep, that's where it's at
Yeah, that's where it's at
Yep, yep, (That's where it's at)
2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded t-shirt hanging off her shoulder (That's where it's at)
How'd you know to wear your hair like that?
How'd you know to turn up that song?
How'd you know them little tore up jeans
Was gonna tear me up and turn me on?
Girl, it's like you know me too good
But you barely know me at all
Yeah, the way it's going tonight
You probably know I'm ready to fall cause
Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you know that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)
Girl it's like you got a crystal ball
Like you got a little gypsy side
It's like you knew that sweet perfume
That you got on was gonna get me high
Well how'd you know what I'm thinking right now?
How'd you know what I was about to say?
How'd you know to whisper in my ear
Let's take this party back to my place
Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
Yeah, that's what you are
It's like you knew just when to lean on in
And take my hand like you had it all planned
And girl you've got me figured out, don't ya now?
Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And girl when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)
Yeah, that's what you are
(Baby, you're a little mind, baby, you're a little mind reader)
We got the ride, yeah, all gassed up and ready
We got the coolest cooler, chilling in the back of my Chevy
We got diamonds in the sky, silver moon shining on this road
We got hands in the air, wind in our hair, a party on the radio
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
We got the night right where we want it
Yeah, it sure feels good, don't it?
Baby say left, and that's right where I'll be turning
Baby say right, alright, we'll get this back road burning
And we ain't gonna slow it down
'Til the sun comes creeping up
We got a good time and the headlights
And there ain't no stopping us
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
We got the night right where we want it
We got diamonds in the sky
Yeah the time is on our side
And we got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
And we got the night right where we want it
Oh, we got the night, we got the night, girl
Oh, right where we want it
Fancy ties, pinstripe suits
Gold cuff links, Italian shoes
But she likes boots, she wants a cowboy
New York City, a Soho flat
Wall Street clean cut hair slicked back
But she likes hats, she wants a cowboy
Riding with him in the wide open
Cheyenne wind, no fences can hold 'em
Ropin' her dreams, Texas and smoke in his voice
She wants a cowboy
Motorcycles, turbo Porches
Sailboats, Rolls Royces
But she likes horses, she wants a cowboy
Riding with him in the wide open
Cheyenne wind, no fences can hold 'em
Ropin' her dreams, Texas and smoke in his voice
She wants a cowboy
Riding with him in the wide open
Cheyenne wind, no fences can hold us
Ropin' her dreams, lucky for me I was her choice
She wants a cowboy
She wants a cowboy
It's a middle of nowhere, nobody comes here town
You're either born and raised and you stay or you turn right around
Podunk, court house, stop light blinking
Four wheels, corn fields, I know what you're thinking
Who'd wanna live in this place
Who'd wanna suffer the fate
Of a life spent pulling a plow through the dirt
Who'd wanna put down roots in a blue collar suit
We do, and a few of us know what it's worth
A little buckshot dot on a map it might be
But it's the world to me
I know these hollers and hills and fields down to every square inch
I know every name sprayed in Dupont paint on that bridge
Had my first kiss, learned to shift gears on these back roads
All that and all of this makes me one of those
Who'd wanna live in this place
Who'd wanna suffer the fate
Of a life spent pulling a plow through the dirt
Who'd wanna put down roots in a blue collar suit
We do, and a few of us know what it's worth
A little buckshot dot on a map it might be
Oh, but it's the world to me
It's those Friday night games
Barry's Tavern on Main
Where we got a cold beer after a hard day's work
It's who we are through and through
From our hats to our boots
It's the truth, and we all know what it's worth
A little buckshot dot on a map it might be
But it's the world to me
Oh, the world to me
Girl the way you move when you move is like a melody
Yeah, the music hits when your lips get a hold of me
You know just the way, what to play to keep me hanging on
Your kiss is like a song
Sing it to me 'til the morning sun comes up
Love the sound of your love, turn it up, turn it up
Hitting repeat, girl, I got you stuck in my head
Should get out of this bed, but instead
Go ahead, sing it to me
Sing it to me, girl (all night)
Sing it to me, girl (all right)
Sing it to me, girl
Baby when you start you make my heart beat like an 808
Like it ain't no thing, you pull my strings when you say my name
When your finger tips get to getting round where they belong
Your touch is like a song
Sing it to me 'til the morning sun comes up
Love the sound of your love, turn it up, turn it up
Hitting repeat, girl, I got you stuck in my head
Should get out of this bed, but instead
Go ahead, sing it to me
Sing it to me, girl (all night)
Sing it to me, girl (all right)
Sing it to me, girl
Lost in the rhythm that you give
And your love's like a song
Come on, come on
Sing it to me 'til the morning sun comes up
Love the sound of your love, turn it up, turn it up
Hitting repeat, girl, I got you stuck in my head
Should get out of this bed, but instead
Go ahead, sing it to me
Sing it to me, girl (all night)
Sing it to me, girl (all right)
Sing it to me, girl
Sing it to me
All night, all right
Hand me down guitar, handful of friends
Park in the dark, where the road dead ends
With the trunk popped open and the music blowing out the JBLs
Just popping them tops, yeah we were shooting off like a shotgun shell saying
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Fake ID, worn out boots
And they can't tell me nothing kind of attitude
Got a Styrofoam cup, gonna fill it on up with a little bit of whiskey
Just talking that smack, gonna take it out back, who's coming with me?
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Find yourself a girl, get her number, maybe kiss her
Got a pack of Swishers, anybody got a light?
Just down home boys staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
That four on the floor
Try to leave a little more than a mark on a blacktop
Got the world on the string
We were living like kings of a run down.
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Down home boys staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoa
Is that a green light? Is that a stop sign?
I don't know which way that you want me to go
Trying to look deep in your blue eyes
Do I lean on in or just leave it alone?
It's like I'm lost in a hundred acre field
No map and I've got no lights
Wondering what kind of friends you wanna be
I'm wishing I could read your mind
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
Do you want me like I want you?
Or is this just how you treat all the guys?
Are you a little tease or are you into me?
Is this is a game you play, oh, give me a sign
It's like I'm lost in a town I've never been before, just driving around
Girl, you've gotta help me out
Gotta tell me which roads you want me to go down
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
I'm out here wondering where to go
Doing nothing but it's just a dead end road
So here I go, leaning in, nice and slow
I just gotta know
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
No, don't leave me in the middle of nowhere
I just wanna kiss you all the time
Girl I wanna go there
Baby, would it be alright
Oh, I'm so lost tonight
Out here in the middle of nowhere
I bet you're sick of them pick up lines, the same thing every Friday night
You're so hot girl, you're looking so fine, like you don't already know
They say they'll treat you right, show you the city lights
Get you sipping on something you don't even like
I guess they don't know, they're on the wrong road
I know what you wanna hear
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
Ain't that music to your ears?
Tell me, have I got you figured out?
Baby, ain't that what you're all about?
Do I make you wanna leave this crowd and head on out of here
'Cause I can tell by that little shine smile
What I'm talking bout's a little more of your style
It'll only take a couple of miles to the
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
Ain't that music to your ears?
They say they'll treat you right, show you the city lights
Get you sipping on something you don't even like, girl
They don't know, but I know, I know you like
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
I know what you wanna hear, girl
Oh yeah, ain't that music to your ears?
Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He's got a heart of gold, right hand like a vice
Same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night
Barbed wire tough and cowboy cool
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand, first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
They say there's things about him that you see in me
He's the kind of man I want to be
Got to give the man credit where credit is due
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand, first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man, oh but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
It's whispered from a tractor on a flat Midwestern plain
The fields are dry and dusty, there is no sign of rain
It floats out a kitchen window, somewhere in the south
If the river gets much higher, they'll float away no doubt
You can almost feel it in the air, an American prayer
They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
Got faith in us, got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen
It echoes through the factories up in Michigan
It bounces off the levees, and rides out on the wind
Clear out to California, and back on up to Maine
Don't matter if you're rich or poor, a sinner or a saint
Every night, everybody, everywhere
Is praying their American prayer
They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
Got faith in us, got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen
They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
Got faith in us, got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen
Amen
I'd like to ask you from the start
If you could pull me out of the dark.
Or if our love could fall apart like cookies crumble.
See, I'm a demon on the loose.
I'm like an engine with no caboose.
And I need somebody who can really handle me.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild, wild one.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
I just wanna let you know, girl,
I'm attracted to your physical.
But, I got this lazy eye that likes to wander, oh.
See, I'm tired of being alone,
So if you throw this dog a bone,
Baby, you and I can make our house a home, yeah.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild, wild one.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run. Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Oh, you could be the one who saves me,
Or try to be the one who tames me.
Girl, you are the one who's changing my way of life.
I'm tired of painting the town with ladies
Or living the life so hazy.
I'm tired of all my lies,
I think I want some real love
But, girl, you gotta realize.
Yeah that, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby I'm a wild, wild one.
Yeah, baby I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.

Oh,

(Yeah, baby, I'm a) Hog wild, don't let me run
Don't let me get away
Yeah baby, I'm a wild, wild one, oh wild wild wild one.
She said so, so many times in my life
Once I thought things were fine, it would rain
This is how it is each and everyday I live
Things I thought would be my joy, turn to pain
So when it pours and you're in deep water
And you can't tell the difference from the rain and your tears
I will be the one whos there, who'll always be there
To drink the river flowing from your eyes
Exodus is yours, love
Let the midnight sun disappear
Heaver would be yours, love
Let me be the one to take you there
So don't worry or sweat the small things
Everything in your lives bound to change
All the things you're going through
I will bare the weight with you
There's no shame, know what I'm saying
There's a way to pull through
Oh and when it pours girl and you're in deep water
And you can tell the difference from the rain and your tears
I will be the one whos there, who'll always be there
To drink the river flowing from your eyes
Exodus is yours, love
Let the midnight sun disappear
And Heaven could be yours, love
Let me be the one to take you there
Oh
I'll help you carry it all
(I'll help you carry all)
You don't have to worry at all
(No you don't have to worry)
And if you stumble and fall
(If you sumble and fall)
I'll be there for you
(I'll help you, aw)
I"ll help you carry it all
(You don't have to, aw)
You don't have to worry at all
Girl and if you fall, I'll be there
Through it all, through it all
Exodus is yours, love
Let the midnight sun disappear
And Heaven could be yours, love
Please let me be the one to take you there, there
Exodus is yours, love
Let the midnight sun disappear
And Heaven could be yours, love
Let me be the one to take you there
Da Da da da da da...
Da da da da dum da dum
Every time I see you (I see you)
It's good to see you again (hey baby)
You make me feel like I've seen the sun (sun shining)
Your loving let's me know that I'm the only one
And I hear you:
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder (Wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder, baby, wonder, baby
Lovin' you is like my dream come true
I want you to know that I'll always be there standing up for you
From the mountain
From the river
From the root to the to the, baby
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder (Wonder how you got so good)
Sometimes I wonder, baby, wonder, baby
When I look in to the mirror (What do you see)
I see me and I see you (And how are we)
Joined from the soul
Our hearts together
Just living together in melody baby
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how we got so good)
Sometimes I wonder (I wonder how wegot so good)
Sometimes I wonder (Wonder how we got so good)
Sometimes I wonder, baby, wonder, baby
Living together in melody

In melody

I'd like to ask you from the start
If you could pull me out of the dark.
Or if our love could fall apart like cookies crumble.
See, I'm a demon on the loose.
I'm like an engine with no caboose.
And I need somebody who can really handle me.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild, wild one.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
The look on your face
It could never explain your heart
And the touch of my lips
It could never tell you my thoughts
And you want me to change
I can't get used to
All you want me to be
I just can't pretend
To be anyone else
'Cause it's not really me
This is my world
This is who I am
And I'm not gonna give up myself
To make your life better
She said
This is how it is
I got my own life to live
And you can either accept me
Or baby
And if it's love
That we share
Then we can withstand all
The obstacles that life brings forth
And I will receive you
For who you are who you were
And baby who you will be
But you want me to change
Girl I can't get used to
All you want me to be
And I just can't pretend
To be anyone else, oh
'Cause it's not really me
This is my world
This is who I am
And I'm not trying to give up myself
To make your life better, now
This is how it is
I got my own life to live
And you can either accept me
Or baby
This is my world
This is who I am
And I'm not trying to give up myself
To make your life better
She said
This is how
I got my own life to live
And you can either accept me
Or baby let me go
You said I promise you the stars
And I'm
Giving you all I can now
You said love is not enough
And I know
You will see
If your life turns around
In my heart there is room for you
It's me and my world
This is who I am
And I'm not trying to give up myself
To make your life better
She said
This is how
I got my life
And you can either accept me
Or baby
This is my world
Who I am
And I'm not trying to give up myself
To make your life better, now
Oh, this is how
And I got my life
And you can either accept me
Or baby let me go
This is my world
My world
Baby let me go
Oh, this is who I am
Where I live
Got my own life to give
Oh, oh oh
My world
I'm not trying to change you
This is who I am
Please let me be me, yeah
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah
I'm just so glad you're mine
Baby, why did it take so long
Oh baby, see
You only made my love grow stronger
Baby, yeah, yeah

When darkness gather 'round me
Friends forsake me

I know you'll never let me down
Oh, I know you'll never say
Baby, don't turn away, no, oh baby
Baby, I'm not going to leave you alone, no
Baby, yeah, girl
On top of that I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, hey, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine
When darkness gather 'round me
My friends forsake me

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, yeah, baby
I'm just thankful for your love, yeah
She lives right there off of Rutledge Avenue
She has a few friends but she only has a few
Her next door neighbor plays his music way too loud
She often complains but they play it anyhow
What is a girl supposed to do
Living alone can have you so confused
But remember now
It won't be too long, girl
Find out where you belong
When you're feeling afraid and alone
Just remember two words, hold on
She works all day just to put herself through school
'Cause financial aid doesn't seem to cover food, no, no, no, no
Every morning she rides on the bus to make her gains
It's easy to attain but so hard to sustain, yeah
What is a girl supposed to do
Living alone can have you so confused
But remember now
It won't be too long, girl
You find out where you belong
Whether you're feeling afraid and alone
Just remember two words, hold on
She's coping with pain of things she left behind
Multiple pressures that cloud her mind
And she feels it, her eyes carry no signs of joy
She's tired of rubbing it all the time
Found independence is not so kind
Life ain't easy, all she needs is a friend
Hold on
It won't be too long, girl
Find out where you belong
Feeling afraid and alone
Remember two words, hold on
It won't be too long
Find out where you belong
Feeling afraid and alone
Remember two words, hold on
I remember when I saw you there
What did you see in me, tell me
Let all the people stop and stare
You were the only one that I could see
Time comes and time goes by
We loved, we laughed, I failed, you tried
And now I understand why
I have to be the one to blame
Ten years down the line, I never meant to waste your time
So glad you never threw in the towel on you and me
You showed me unconditional love, you even gave me the one
And baby, now that we're done, I'm sorry
See I was standing up with things to say
So I had to decide
For me it was either you or them
And I was running out of precious time
You see, I had to see the world
I knew it meant losing you, my girl
Since I lost it all today
These simple words to you I'd say
We should have given up at least a thousand times
So girl, I wouldn't be surprised if you wrote me off, no
You see I know that I put my friends before you
And I constantly ignored who was in my corner
Now, I apologize
Ten years down the line, I never meant to waste your time
So glad you never threw in the towel on you and me
You showed me unconditional love, you even gave me the one
And baby, now that we're done, I'm sorry
Don't you know that
You should have given up at least a thousand times
But, girl, why would I be surprised, why would it shock me
When you write me off but you can't
Can't you see I, I put my band, I put my band
Wow, I ignored you
Then in return, you were there for me
And I, I apologize
Ten years down the line, I never meant to waste your time
So glad you never threw in the towel on you and me
You showed me unconditional love, you even gave me the one
And baby, now that we're done, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Two weeks ago I got a note addressed to me from you, babe
You're telling me you gotta leave and that you just can't take it no more
I promised you when we first met if you have to go I'll let you go but
There's one request I have before you go
Don't say no no no
Girl can we spend one more night
Can we make up just to break up our lives
It will be the last night that we spend let's not fight
Girl can we spend one more night
See, not trying to make you stay I don't wanna change your mind
But I wanna hold you one last time as if you were still mine
When the morning comes you'll be gone and I'll be here all alone
But there's still tonight the mood is right
So before you go don't say no no no
Girl can we spend one more night
Can we make up just to break up our lives
It will be the last night that we spend let's not fight
Girl can we spend one more night
Girl can you let me know, just let me know, before you go if you'd rather be with me
I'll make it alright just for the night
Just let me feel you let me hear you
Call my name, call out my name
Just one last time, one last night
Girl can we spend one more night
Can we make up just to break up our lives
It'll be the last night that we spend let's not fight
Girl can we spend one more night
Can we make up just to break up our lives
It'll be the last night that we spend let's not fight
Girl can we spend one more night
Don't acted surprised, it ain't like you didn't know
It's been a long long time coming and it's time for me to go
Trying to split things up could drive us crazy
So I'm gonna make this easy baby
You can have the money
You can have the house
Take the Cadillac and that pool out back
And your mothers pink and yellow couch
You can have every penny that I'll make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone
Don't get me wrong, I will always love you girl
You were my life, you were my heart, you were my world
But we both know it's over, there's no need to fight it
Girl I just need some peace and quiet
So you can have the money
Ah you can have the house
Take the Cadillac and that pool out back
And that ugly pink and yellow couch
You can have every penny that I will make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone
Ah you can have the money
You can have the house
Take the big screen and your diamond ring
And those shoes that you swore you couldn't live without
You can have every penny that I will make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone
Girl all I need you to leave me is alone
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I wasn't coming back, said I'd had enough
Saw you in the rear view standing, fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
When we make choices, we gotta live with them
Heard you found a real good man and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away? 
Don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been all worked out
Yeah I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think you don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
No no, don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
Mmmmmmm...
Why do we hate, why do we suffer
Why do we make our mistakes and constantly blame one another
Why is there war and why is there killing
Have we forgotten some secret we knew back when we were just children
If I had wings, I'd fly up to heaven
I'd look down from the clouds on everything
Then I could find all the things we've been missing
I would have all the answers, if I had wings
Like why am I aching and where did I come from
And where will I go when my time here on this earth is done
And what will I leave that will go one forever, ohoho
And what can I do while I'm here to make someones life better
If I had wings, I'd fly up to heaven
I'd look down from the clouds on everything
Then I could find all the things we've been missing
I would have all the answers, if I had wings
Ohoho now, if I had wings, I would fly up to heaven
I would have all the answers, if I had wings
Don't move, baby don't move
Ah look at you
I just want to take this in
The moonlight dancin' off your skin
Our time, let's take our time
I just want to look in your eyes and catch my breath
'Cause I got a feeling
This could be one of those memories
We're wanna hold on too, cling too, the one we can't forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the dawn of forever
What if this was that moment, that chance worth taking
History in the making
Inside, baby inside
Can you feel the butterflies floating all around
'Cause I can sure feel 'em now
Tonight, maybe tonight
Is the start of a beautiful ride that will never end
And baby I've got a feeling
This could be one of those memories
We're wanna hold on too, cling too, the one we can't forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the dawn of forever
What if this was that moment, that chance worth taking
History in the making
Right here, right now, holding you in my arms
This could be one of those memories
We wanna hold on too, we wanna gonna cling too, the one that we can't forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the start to forever
What if this was that moment, that chance worth taking
History in the making, ah yeah
History in the making, nah nah
This is a chance worth taking, ahah
Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright
Don't need no five star reservations
I've got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I've got a stereo and the best of Patsy Cline
Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see, I've got everything I want
'Cause I've got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, yeah
And I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you
It may be a simple life, but that's okay
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made
'Cause I've got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, yeah
I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
It's alright by me, yeah yeah
When I lay down at night I thank the Lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of
'Cause I've got a roof over my head,
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright, alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, alright, yeah
I've got all I need, yeah
I've got all I need
And it's alright by me, oh yeah
It's alright by me
He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed and listening
To his newborn baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says, 
"It's gonna be okay"
"It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby, just hold on
It won't be like this for long"
Four years later, 'bout 4:30
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at pre-school
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says, "What can I do?"
She says, "Now, don't you worry
This'll only last a week or two"
"It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she won't even know you're gone
This phase is gonna fly by
If you can just hold on
It won't be like this for long"
Someday soon she'll be a teenager
And at times, he'll think she hates him
And he'll walk her down the aisle
And raise her veil 
But right now she's up and cryin'
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her goodnight
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
'Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
'Cause he already knows
It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is gonna be
All grown up and gone
And this phase is gonna fly by
So he's trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long
Last thing I remember
I met the boys down at the jammer
We had a few beers, and a few shots
I woke up the next day
With cotton mouth and a headache
Trying to connect all the dots
Staring up at the ceiling
I got that funny feeling
Looked over and I, I saw my ex-girlfriend
I felt like a fool, and that's when I knew
I'd been drinkin' and dialin' again
So the next time you think I've had too much to drink
And you tell me I shouldn't drive home
When you take my keys, oh I'm begging you please
Go on take my cell phone
'Cause I have been known
After tying one on to call up a couple old friends
And tell them that I love them, or maybe don't cuss them
When I'm drinkin' and dialin' again
So the next time you think I've had too much to drink
And you tell me I should not drive home
Oh when you take my keys, oh I'm begging you please
Go on take my cell phone
If you've ever heard, me slurring my words
On your voicemail around 4 a.m.
You'll have to forgive me, and blame it on the whiskey
I was drinkin' and dialin' again
I've been drinkin' and dialin' again
I'm eight years old, daddy's cutting my hair
Aqua Velva on his hands
Mama's in the kitchen,
Got fried green tomatoes poppin' in the pan
I see a home run, a gold line
Holding my breath getting baptized
I see her beautiful face under that veil as she's walking down the aisle
I can hear the sirens coming
Smell the gasoline and smoke
I'm pinned against this steering wheel
Pretty sure my arm is broke
I can see the flames and my life
Flashing right before my eyes
I hope they get to me in time
I could see the headlights swerve
So I cut the wheel to the right
Last thing I saw was the bottle turned up
As he crossed that center line
I see tiny hands, brown eyes
falling asleep to that lullaby
And you slide over next to me as I turned out the lights
I can hear the sirens coming
Smell the gasoline and smoke
I'm pinned against this steering wheel
Pretty sure my arm is broke
I can see the flames and my life
Flashing right before my eyes
I hope they get to me in time
Please Lord, I'm begging you
Don't let me go like this
There's so much left that I want to do
So much I don't want to miss, no
I can see the flames and my life
Flashing right before my eyes
I hope they get to me in time
Just get to me in time
Please get to me in, in time
Thirty-nine candles burnt out on a cake
Each representin' a million mistakes
The last one still burns, there's a wish I can make
This time I'm gettin' it right
So I close my eyes and I take a deep breath
And I promise myself in the time I have left
I'm gonna work like I don't need the money
I'm gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry
I'm gonna dance like nobody's watchin'
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
Lovin' me hasn't been easy on you
I don't know why, but I know you still do
It may be my day, but here's a present for you
You're lookin' at your new man
He's sincere and sober and faithful and kind
And he's home when you need him and girl startin' tonight
I'm gonna work like I don't need the money
I'm gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry
I'm gonna dance like nobody's watchin'
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
No more excuses and no more me doing things wrong
Life is too short, baby, I've wasted ours for too long
And baby from now on
I'm gonna work like I don't need the money
I'm gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry
I'm gonna dance like nobody's watchin'
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
I'm gonna work (gonna work like I don't need the money) I know I am
I'm gonna laugh (gonna laugh like I'm not afraid to cry) laugh, laugh, laugh
I'm gonna dance (I'm gonna dance like nobody's watchin') I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
I'm gonna love while I still got the time
While I still got the time
If you're a man like me who is good at leaving 
If you like your space and you love your freedom 
Don't see yourself as ever settlin' down 
Or your whole world being tossed around 
Be wary of a woman 
A woman so fine 
Don't want to change you 
Loves you just right 
Makes you feel like a man inside 
Sometimes she'll make you cry 
'Till you don't know what you're doing 
You're out of control 
Forget about leaving your heart won't go 
If don't like that you better run and hide 
And be wary of a woman like mine 
She'll make you laugh when you feel like crying 
Make you want to live when you feel like dying 
So if you like living in the dark 
Just walk away, you're going to lose your heart 
Be wary of a woman 
A woman so fine 
Don't want to change you 
Loves you just right 
Makes you feel like a man inside 
Sometimes she'll make you cry 
'Till you don't know what you're doing 
You're out of control 
Forget about leaving your heart won't go 
If don't like that you better run and hide 
And be wary of a woman like mine 
Be wary of a woman like mine 
Man, you don't stand a chance don't even try 
Be wary of a woman like mine, oh
Be wary of a woman 
A woman so fine 
Don't want to change you 
Loves you just right 
Makes you feel like a man inside 
Sometimes she'll make you cry 
'Till you don't know what you're doing 
You're out of control 
Forget about leaving your heart won't go 
If don't like that you better run and hide 
And be wary of a woman like mine 
A woman like mine 
Be wary of a woman like mine, oh
A woman like mine
Got a baby girl sleeping in my bedroom
And her mama laughing in my arms
There's the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start
I don't really know how I got here
But I'm sure glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could've changed all of it
Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this
Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or that college I wanted to go to
'Til I got that letter
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All lead me here to you
I didn't understand it way back when
But sitting here right now it all makes perfect sense
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this
How I cried when my mama passed away
But now I've got an angel looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake
For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this
It led me here to this
I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it... pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like that I poured it down the drain
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song
And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
Now I'll just dream of you instead
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my get back, come back
Hey, I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song
Oh yeah yeah
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl, yeah
We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, yeah
Come on now
This is my my bad, come back song
I'll chase the kids around the yard all afternoon
Put away the dishes so she don't have to
Fix the screen door on the porch like I said I'd do
Tell her I don't know how you do it baby when I'm gone
Dance her 'round the kitchen to a George Strait song
Sneak a kiss on the back of the neck like we were alone
And if I'm right on the money
You know I might get lucky
There's a window of opportunity between
When the kids are tucked in and a half glass of Chardonnay
She knows what I'm thinking reads me like a book
But the key to get a second look
And a come here honey
Is treat her right in the daylight
And I might get lucky
Well I work out on the road and it wears us thin
She wonders when I'm leaving even when I'm walking in
So we set aside time to get to know each other again
And if I play my cards right
I know it sounds kind of funny
But I might get lucky
Someday she might wake up and see
She's way out of my league
But then again
Maybe she won't
You know I might get lucky
I might get lucky
I might get lucky
I might get lucky
Always there
When my world starts closing in
Something to hold
No matter how long it's been
Gets me high
Then knocks me to the ground
Soothes my mind
And then begins to break me down
Whiskey and you
Ain't nothing I can do
But come crawling back to
Whiskey and you
I never asked you to love me
I never begged you to stay
But I never want you to leave me
I wouldn't have it any other way
As darkness finds the candle
And the flame stops flickering
Girl I know and I hope
It won't be too long
Till we light it up again
Whiskey and you
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing I can do
But I keep crawling, I keep coming back to
Whiskey and you
I can't get you off the tip of my tongue,
You're running through my head again
Like one of those summer sing-a-long songs,
I play you once and you're just stuck 'em in
I'm either talkin' about ya or thinkin' about ya
Or runnin' my mouth about bein' without ya to all my friends
Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
'Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up
I get sick of the sound of my own voice
When I get a couple drinks in me
I gotta admit the way you got me whipped
You know it's kinda embarrassing
I'm tired of the drama so hey little mama, I'm hopin' you wanna
So tell me you're gonna be on your way
Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
'Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up
I'm either talkin' about ya or thinkin' about ya
Or runnin' my mouth about bein' without ya to all my friends
So come on and
Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Yeah baby
Shut me up with your love
Just one little taste, baby watch what it does
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
'Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up
Yeah, baby shut me up
Oh yeah
Shut me up!
Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look,
Just tell him, it's you, it ain't him,
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you're so done with him, break up with him, break up with him
You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend,
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him
Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom
Red sky faded to black 
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didn't care if we were spinnin' wheels
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around 
We could hardly breathe 
Breakin' new ground in my back seat 
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
Yeaahee
With beer on our breath in a parking lot 
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe 
Breakin' new ground in my back seat 
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas 
Goin' nowhere fast 
Goin' nowhere fast
She was diggin' up her sundress, showing off her tatty
She said, "I like your ride, maybe you could be my caddy
What you say you pick us up a six-pack of Natty"
Aww nice
She had a sweet little southern twang
Said, "We don't have to talk about forever things
For tonight maybe we could just hang like a pair of dice"
Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crash this town
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I said, girl you got your shades on, looking like you're famous
We could turn this little one horse into Vegas
Holdin' you is like I'm holdin' all the aces
I can't lose
She said, "Come on, boy, pour it on"
She didn't know that I was already gone
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crash this town
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Stop got a little gasoline at the old bean peak
Rollin' 'round wound up in the middle of BFE
Spinnin' these wheels down a road that we ain't ever seen
Who knows where we are
I get a little more lost every time I look in her eyes
It's hard to keep my hands on the wheel when she's looking so fine
I ride down any back road that she wants me to drive
With the
Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind
Whoa
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Something about the sound of the gravel setting the mood
Is got me thinking I should park this thing underneath the moon
And wrap ourselves all around each other like a vine of cuzzo
With the
Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind
Whoa
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Who knows where this is winding up
I don't mind if it's getting late
Lucky stars are lining up
She's loving every move I make
With the
Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind
Whoa
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Whoa
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Whoa
Strictly outta curiosity,
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me
Gimme any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got somethin' we could start tonight
Lookin' at you girl it's hard to fight
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Come on baby shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my lock screen
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we got the beat let's drop it
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
Tattoos, cutoffs and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
T-shirt of your favorite rock band
Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
In your snapback
A girl like you in a bar like this
Well no offense but you don't fit in
Red lipstick on the rim of that glass
All dressed up, all by yourself, what's up with that?
Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to get over somebody
Is it a high, or is it a low
Baby I just gotta know
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Is this take a seat or take a hike
Is it take a shot or on the rocks tonight
Is it lonely or just alone
Would you wanna tap your number in if I handed you my phone
Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to meet somebody
Letting me get to you or letting me go
Baby I just gotta know
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning to the side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you windin' up
Or windin' down
Are you paying your tab
Or are we painting the town
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
One more with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning to the side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Stop got a little gasoline at the old bean peak

I'm tired of having fun
I'm sick of watching that sunset, painting the sky red
I just wanna turn in early
I don't want to see where this goes
You're getting just a little to flirty
You're getting just a little to close
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
'Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
I wish you'd just behave
I wish that strap would stay, up there on your shoulder
I don't want to buy you another drink
I'd rather go home alone instead
I don't wanna wake up in the morning
Slide to your side of the bed
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
'Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
I don't wanna know what it feels like
To be loved by a girl like you
Last thing I need is your heart beating to my heart beat
And I don't wanna hear you say
Ooh, baby
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
'Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Yeah
I never liked Def Leppard till I heard you sing that song
Never wanted to go to Cali till you had that t-shirt on
Never wanted to change my style, change my point of view
The truth is girl, I'd take this whole damn thing and change it all for you
You got that real thing that good vibe it feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (oh)
Gives me that heart rush that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (oh)

Provocative
So classic
You're rockin' it

Wanna be one of those late night things that keeps you up
Wanna be the digits that you dial when you get drunk
I wanna be that smile that's on your face that all your friends don't understand
I'll be the stamp from the club that won't wash off your hand
You got that real thing that good vibe it feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (oh)
Gives me that heart rush that can't help but wanna touch

Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom
Red sky faded to black 
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didn't care if we were spinnin' wheels
With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around 
We could hardly breathe 
Breakin' new ground in my back seat 
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
Yeaahee
With beer on our breath in a parking lot 
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe 
Breakin' new ground in my back seat 
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas 
Goin' nowhere fast 
Goin' nowhere fast
She was diggin' up her sundress, showing off her tatty
She said, "I like your ride, maybe you could be my caddy
What you say you pick us up a six-pack of Natty"
Aww nice
She had a sweet little southern twang
Said, "We don't have to talk about forever things
For tonight maybe we could just hang like a pair of dice"
Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crash this town
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I said, girl you got your shades on, looking like you're famous
We could turn this little one horse into Vegas
Holdin' you is like I'm holdin' all the aces
I can't lose
She said, "Come on, boy, pour it on"
She didn't know that I was already gone
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crash this town
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look,
Just tell him, it's you, it ain't him,
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you're so done with him, break up with him, break up with him
You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend,
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him
Right now we both know
We're Marina del Rey
Planes gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by this time tomorrow
I'll be singing yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in
I can't make you love me
Let's be brown eyed girl sweet Caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time
Just for one more day what do you say
Baby be my pretty woman
'Cause we know Sunday morning's coming down
Let's take a drive you and I down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those pink houses
Yeah we might be a candle in the wind
But let's pretend we're
Brown eyed girl sweet Caroline
Free fall small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream,
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon you will be always on my mind
But that's a song for another time
So before we're singing I will always love you
Let's sing
Hey, you don't have to stay
You don't have to say
Anything that you don't wanna say
Hey, you don't have to go
We can take it slow
Or we can move it alone, move it along
We can keep it on the couch
And keep the lights on
Naked makin' out, or keep our clothes on
Don't worry 'bout where it's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed
Up the stairs or down the block
If it last forever until one o'clock
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til it's over
So we never really know
Which way the wind's goin' blow
So let's ride it out for a while right here
You can spend the night, but you don't have to
I can spend the night just looking at you
Here I cannot lie where's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed
Upstairs or down the block
If it lasts forever or until three o'clock
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til it's over
Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
Let's not worry about tomorrow
Or the rest of our lives
Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
All I know is we gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til it's over
'Til it's over
We got the songs
We got the beats
We got the bar
Where we used to meet
We got our names
In the concrete
On Lincoln street
And we got New York
We got L.A
We got that run-down hotel where we stayed
We got so drunk
We jumped in the pool
Slept in all day
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right
We got it right
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
Even though it ended
We got it right
We got tequila
We got tattoos
Heart with a dagger
Nothing to lose
Black and white strip
From that photo booth
We thought we were cool
And now you got someone else
And I got mine
Neither one of 'em knows that every time
They play Meet Virginia
I'm on your mind
And you're on mine (girl, you're on mine)
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right
We got it right
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
Even though it ended
We got it right
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
We got it right
We got it right
We got it right
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up
How did my mom and my dad ever do it
If there were troubles then we never knew it
I guess they had each other and that was enough
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep that chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's what's up
Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love love love love...
You gotta love love love love...
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other day
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway
Everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patten leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy
Come dance with me 'cause dancings free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about

Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words was: Do not disturb
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in till three
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both no we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
And danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered: Would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both no we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah
She kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Ooh
She kept the hotel key

Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won't say the words that I want but you flirt when you're drinkin'
I see those bubbles pop up like you're texting then they disappear
Let's cut through the shit then let's get to what we're doing here
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause I'm tired of asking myself
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Girl you're like a model on a Soho street
Walking on air like you own it
It's like I'm sipping on a bottle in a penthouse suite
You're lighting me up and you know it
With that just right Friday night curl in your hair
Got my heart beating louder than Madison Square
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gon' keep me going till the morning light
Girl you're like
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That uptown something
It's got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night
A party ain't a party, girl, till you walk in
'Cause where you are is where everything happens
You could spin the globe and no matter where it lands
Kick your feet up and call it Manhattan
You're like a Tiffany mannequin down on 5th Avenue
Making every other woman wish that they could be you
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gon' keep me going till the morning light
Girl you're like
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That Uptown something
It's got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night
Girl you're like a model on a Soho street
Walking on air like you own it
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That Uptown something
It's got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night
(Places and streetlights)
New York at night
(Shining in your eyes)
Empire high
That Uptown something
Its got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night
New York at night
Seems innocent enough when your buying the drinks at the bar
And you're both getting loaded
You don't even know just the danger you're in
'Cause you're so caught up in the moment
But you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
Hits you before you even know
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think, son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So be careful when you're holding one
'Cause a girl is a gun, yeah
(It's a little word of advice)
She's cold and she's hot
She's fun but she's not some play thing two dollar pistol
Say the right thing she'll go off with a bang
But be careful 'cause she kicks a little
Hold her just right don't let her down
You're gonna get hurt if you mess around
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think, son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger (think twice)
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So be careful when you're holding one
'Cause a girl (a girl) is a gun (a girl is a gun)
Yeah, a girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think, son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So be careful when you're holding one (be careful when you're holding one)
'Cause a girl ('cause a girl) is a gun ('cause a girl is a gun)
Yeah, a girl ('cause a girl) is a gun ('cause a girl is a gun)
Look it out
('Cause a girl is a gun)
('Cause a girl)
('Cause a girl is a gun)
The Sun going down on a little beach town out west
A wide open highway, a window seat on a jet
The sound of a train pulling out of the station
A man like me should find inspiration in anything
But here I am in this hotel room
Still writing songs about
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you
A pawn shop in Dallas cut me a deal on a six string
It doesn't know how you look, how you laugh, how you kiss me
Well I'm on the edge of the bed and it's way past two
I'm stuck on a line 'cause I know what rhymes with blue
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But I'm still writing songs about you
If you ever wake up and wonder what I'm up to
Baby I'm right here
Still writing songs about
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
Yeah, I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you
Still writing songs about
Ooh yeah
I get bored, I get drunk
I get drunk, I get brave
I get brave, I get a phone
I get a phone, I get a cab
I get a cab, I get to town
I get to town, I get to thinking
I get to thinking you'd love this bar
I get to the bar, but I can't get you
Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I get close, I get a smile
I get closer, I get goodbye
I get the signs all rearranged
I get crazier and crazier every day
Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
Out of my mind, into my arms
You got me good, you got my heart
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm I oughta do do
Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I can't get you
Two dollars shy of a five dollar bill
Last mile I pushed my truck uphill
About hurt me
I left my truck by the pump right where I parked it
Walked through the doors of the Last Chance Market
Have mercy, I was thirsty
The guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be
I said I don't know man, you tell me
It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline
I could feel that video camera watch me
Checkin' out the sale on the ol' Milwaukee
(Mmm) Three bucks to my name
That cooler had every brand known to man
Tall boys, bottles, and aluminum cans
(Aww) What a shame
And it's gettin' pretty bad when you finally discover
It all comes down to either one or the other
It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline
I could see where this is headed
And I'm tired of talkin'
Cold beer unleaded
Hell I'm walkin'
It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline
Beer or gasoline
It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Now it ain't no fun to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
If you like a man who
You can put your trust in
You don't have to worry
Where he's been
Then rest easy
Girl, you're gonna love me
And if you like to slow dance
To ol' Keith Whitley
Long Sunday drives out
In the country
I'm your cup of tea
Girl, you're gonna love me
Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through
So girl if you like a handful
Of fresh wild flowers
A back rub on a bad day
Talkin' for hours
I'm good company
Girl you're gonna love me
Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through
So girl if you like a big heart
That's in this for the long haul
Till we're rockin' on the front porch
And they're callin' me papaw
Till the last breath you breathe
Girl you're gonna love me
Just try it and see
Girl you're gonna love me
I'm pushing you away each time I pull up that ole barstool,
And drownin' you in every drop I drink.
I'm telling you to go to hell but I'm talking to myself
Cause you're not around to hear what I think.
I'm trying to teach my heart to hate you,
But it ain't workin' right
Now the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight.
Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry,
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy,
But the truth is I'm only, drinkin' me lonely tonight.
He said I'd have to choose between your love and this old bar room,
And I just laughed, but I guess you knew best,
Who cares whose right or wrong tonight, my better half is gone
And this whisky's laying claim to all that's left.
So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right,
When the truth is I'm only drinkin' me lonely tonight.
And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry,
And I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy,
'Cause I'm drinking me lonely tonight
It was the thirtyfirst gathering of the
Thompsons, Joneses, and Smiths
There were tables full of chicken
Taters, collard greens, and grits
Well it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park
Volleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts
Aunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this
Well it started with hand shakes
And lordy, how the babies have grown
As the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along
I saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car
With somethin' clear as water in a mason jar
The lemonade got hearty and, Lordy, the party was on
That ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
Well cousin Johnny was a gator
Jimmy was a UT fan
And that football talk
Was quickly gettin' out of hand
Granny told Uncle Dave that she hated his guts
Got right up in his face said, your whole famn damily's nuts
Chicken legs got to flyin'
And the whoop started hittin' the fan
Yeah, that ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
That ol' park ranger jumped out of his car
Said, listen here folks, it's gone a little too far
Tear it all down, pack it all up
Call it quits while there's still a little love
Yeah I've never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
Yeah it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
Aw, but they had a good time now
Take it home y'all
Well, they say your kiss is like forbidden fruit,
One taste of your sweet strawberry lips,
And I'll be hooked on you, they
Say one day just like a dog,
You'll own me I say lay it on me I'm six foot four and tough as a man can be,
I ain't scared of much, I'll buck right up, there's a fightin' side of me,
They say I'll turn to putty and you'll mold me, well lay it on me,
You might be more then I can stand, after all honey,
I'm just one man, I might wind up sad, beat down and lonely, but
I'm watching the way them jeans low ride, your belly button ring and big blue
Eyes,
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me,
Come on and lay it on me, well,
That "born to break hearts" tattoo don't faze me,
So, stroll your sweet self over here, and
Bring me to my knees, and we'll see who comes out on top,
Now won't we, lay it on me, you might be more then I can stand,
After all honey, I'm just one man, I might wind up sad,
Beat down and lonely, but I'm watching the way them jeans low ride,
Your belly button ring and big blue eyes, and I can hardly wait for you to hold
Me,
Come on and lay it on me, well, lay down
The lawer lay it all on the line, girl I don't care as long as you lay your body
Next to mine,
And if your afraid of falling,
Darlin' don't be come on and lay it on me, I say lay it on me, come on lay it on
You take a wrong turn, drop a ball, fall short, you labor in vain
You choke, miss the boat, bomb out, cave in, fall flat on your face
Yeah that's everyday life
But sometimes...
You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn
You go wild in style, chest out chin up, you're king for a day
And then reality hits like a fist, hits you hard, steels your thunder away
And when it beats you down
The wheel spins around
You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn
You burn like a beacon
Burn like a porch light
Burn like a blue star
Burn like a bon fire
Burn like a flicker in a red hot flame
Burn like a match in a deep dark cave
Like a midnight mile-high blaze
You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn
Yeah you burn.
Like a porch light
Like a blue fire
Hangin' out at the old park pool
Right after Sunday school
Banana Boat, a rubber float
Another summer afternoon
Bon fire at the creek tonight
Bubba bringin' some homemade wine
Just enough to catch a buzz
And get us countrified
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
A population 903
Half of them are kin to me
And those that ain't they know my name
We're like one big family
Gather at that old camp site
To lie about the fish and their size
Uncle Carl and his old guitar
Singin' Louisiana Saturday Night!
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
I should have took you dancing
A little candlelight romancing, with roses
But I was high up on a barstool
Yeah, I was such a blind fool
Now I know it
You won't believe how much I've changed since you left
It took losing you for me to find myself
Oh I wish that you could see me
Steady hands without the whiskey
You'd be so proud
I got a job down at the factory
A brand new suit for Sunday
And I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junkyard,
And they've still got our car
I still see you on your knees
Begging me not to drive
But I took away the keys
And made you climb inside
And I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had to power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers
Lord, I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had the power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers
Yeah look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers
Little beads of light were dancin' off the wall
Reflectin' off the spinning crystal ball
In a dance hall down in Texas, where time slowed to a crawl
Baby, it's just you holdin' on to me in the middle of it all
Oh girl, you're the center of my world
That place in my universe
To me you're every dream I dream
The air I breathe, my everything
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world
My whole life changed the moment I met you
And here we are like Heaven only knew
There could be ten thousand people fillin' up this room
But in my mind, far as I'm concerned, it's just me and you
Oh girl, you're the center of my world
That place in my universe
To me you're every dream I dream
The air I breathe, my everything
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world
You're the center of my world
That place in my universe
They're comin' across the border by the thousands everyday
Lookin' for a better life in the good ol' U.S.A.
Well, everybody's talkin' about the aliens invadin'
While I'm savin' every dime for a Mexican vacation
Me, I'm headed your way, hasta luego Jose
You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Cuervo that is, lil' sunshine, some margaritas,
Cabo San Lucas, maybe go see Chichinitza, I love that word)
Up here we work our asses off just tryin' to get ahead
But you can't spend a dollar if you've worked yourself to death
From what I hear you way of life is an afternoon siesta
Then back to work for a little while for an all night long fiesta
Me, I'm headed your way
Well sounds to me like a pretty fair trade
You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose
(White sandy beaches, pesos and jalapenos,
Palm trees, ocean breeze, ah man, Dos Equis)
You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause you'll freeze your ass off here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Me, I'm kickin' back in the Mexican shade
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Yeah, I'm hittin' the road, man, give me a little burro to ride on, you
Can have my car, that gas is killin' me)
Bartender's sittin' them shots on the bar
Those last two Jagar bombs hit me hard
My best friend left and took the keys to my car
Who's gonna take me home?
That dad gum Jimmy he took me out back
Pulled a Marlboro cigarette out of his cap
Now I remember why I quit all that
Who's gonna take me home?
Well, I can't drive, I can't walk
And I'm a little too high to crawl
I'll hold up this wall
Till I come down or the room stops spinnin'
Gonna stand right here and chill out for a minute
Standin' in the men's room waitin' on a stall
Lean my head up against the cool concrete wall
Hey there's a few numbers I guess I could call
Who's gonna take me home?
(Where's my cell phone?)
Well, I can't drive, I can't walk
And I'm a little too high to crawl
I'll hold up this wall
Till I come down or the room stops spinnin'
Gonna stand right here, Oh wait just a minute!
Twelve little hotties crammed in a back booth
With a bachelorette all drinkin' Vermouth
Lucky for there's just enough room
Well hello girls, next round's on me
Toast a few drinks to the bide to be
Close the town down and then we'll see
Who's gonna take me home?
Yeah, who's gonna take me home?
Yeah, who's gonna take me home?
I can't drive
I can't walk
Too high
To crawl
I like an old guitar
Playin' a Gosdin song
In a smoky bar
That's what turns me on, yeah
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly Hell I'm proud to be What makes me
I like a 60's truck
The kind that's solid steel
The kind that always runs
It takes a man to turn that wheel
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly Hell I'm proud to be What makes me
Yeah, I don't swear in front of no woman
I answer yes, sir to my old man
I drink my liquor with a side of nothin'
Yeah, good and country that's what I am
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
You could say I'm a little bit crazy.
You could call me insane.
Walking around with all these whispers,
Running around here in my brain.
I just can't help but hear em,
Man I can't afford it, I hear voices,
I hear voices!
Like, my dad saying work that job,
But don't work your life away.
And, momma telling me to drop to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday.
And, Granddad saying you can have a few,
But don't ever cross that line.
Yeah!, I hear voices all the time!
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky,
For all that good advice.
Those hard to find words of wisdom,
Hold up here in my life.
And just when I lost my way,
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices,
I hear voices!
Like, my dad saying quit that team,
And, you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life.
And, momma telling me to say a prayer,
Everytime I lay down at night.
And, Grandma saying if you find the one,
You better treat her right,
Yeah!, I hear voices all the time.
Sometimes I try to ignore them.
But I thank God for them.
They make me who I am...
My dad saying work that job,
But don't work your life away.
And, momma telling me to drop to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday.
And, Granddad saying you can have a few,
But don't ever cross that line.
Yeah!, I hear voices all the time!
Yeah!, I hear voices all the time!
All the time...
We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out Overseas
A leather-neck, Jarhead Marine
He said "the Radiator leaks,
And the timing-belt is worn,
But the Heart and Soul of this old beat up truck,
Is The Dashboard."
"It's seen alot of tan legs,
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs, and rock and roll.
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad,
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photo graphs."
He said "If I don't come back,
You can have this Ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the Dashboard."
He said "The paint is peeling off,
It's got dents in both the doors,
If something happens to me don't hang a for-sale sign above the Dashboard."
"It's seen alot of tan legs,

He said "If I don't come back,
You can have this Ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the Dashboard."
I Had the Engine overhauled,
A paint-job and brand new chrome
I Had her washed and waxed, sittin' in the drive the day that he came home
I said "Here's the keys,
She's all yours,
I Fixed everything,
Tuxedo waiters, black tie,
White table clothes and red wine,
We've been planning, this night,
Looking forward to it, for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up,
And you know I love showing you off,
But watching your baby blue eyes,
Dancing in the candle light glow,
All I can think about, is getting you home,
Walking through the front door,
Seeing your black dress hit the floor,
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing,
Like you loving me all night long,
And all I can think about is getting you home
I don't need this menu, no I don't,
I already know just what I want,
Did I hear you right, did you tell me,
Go pay the waiter and lets leave,
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes,
And your hand drawing hearts on mine,
That our night out of the house,
Ain't gonna last too long,
When all you can think about, is getting me home,
Walking through the front door,
Seeing your black dress hit the floor,
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing,
Like you loving me all night long,
And all I can think about is getting you home
Walking through the front door,
Sseeing your black dress hit the floor,
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long,
And all I can think about, all I can think about
She locked her fingers and bowed her head
She said I'm late and I'm really scared
Now you can go but I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it either way
In my daddy's El Camino 
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield 
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it take s a man to raise a child
I laid my head down on the wheel
She said "I know, I know it don't seem real"
She closed her eyes but the tears flowed through
She said "don't hate me for loving you"
In my daddy's El Camino 
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield 
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it take s a man to raise a child
Oh, I could not reassure her
I couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand
In my daddy's El Camino 
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield 
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
In a shoebox the other night 
In between cleaning up piles of messes
That I've made of my life
Ticket stubs, love poems and old letters
I dumped them all out on the bed 
Found a homemade birthday card from my mom
And this is what it said
Yeah, this is what it said
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most 
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Full of things to look back on
I opened up my grandpa's pocket knife 
And I was back to his back porch
It was summertime, I was turning nine
He said you want that knife, it's yours
I remember running off in the yard
Carved my name in every tree
I haven't held it since he passed away
Man it meant the world to me
Because he meant the world to me 
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most 
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Look back on
A little window to the past
Look back on
God knows life goes by so fast 
If ever you should ever doubt the blessings that you've had 
Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most 
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
He was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life
Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land
But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man
Every time he'd talk about her,
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say,
I would walk through Hell on Sunday,
To keep my Rose in Paradise
He hired a man to tend the garden,
Keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone
Now the banker is an old man
That mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found
Every time he talks about her
You can see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, "I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise
Now there's a rose out in the garden
Its beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night
Always be momma's baby, always be daddy's girl
Right now she's makin' 'em crazy
Little Red Robin' Hood, big bad world
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
Can't be innocent forever, ain't never done anything
She'll tell you no but she don't mean never
Turned a corner when she turned eighteen
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
Her folks want to hold her back, but they don't know how
She wants it all and she wants it all right now
Gonna get it all before the sun goes down
She ain't waitin'
She ain't missin'
She ain't worried
That girl needs kissing
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
God, I'm down here on my knees
'Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance 
If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use your help, 'cause from now on
I wanna be a good man
A "do like I should" man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be 
There's any way for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
'Cause it's going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see
That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes 
In the man I wanna be
Well, I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord, don't give up on me
I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin', man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin', "It's all right"
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Seems like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I've wondered
And it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life, and you just gotta play the game
I find me a place in a box car
So I take out this old guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest and I'm alright
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Yeah, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight.
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So baby tell me would it be all right
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here.
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact baby why don't you grab
A couple glasses and a bottle of wine.
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take if from there.
Yeah I can take it from there.
I'm gonna put an ol' record on, Conway Twitty.
Yell girl I'd love to lay you down.
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Ain't gonna stop lovin' you till the candle burns out.
Oh there it is, that little smile of yours.
Come on darlin' whatcha waitin' for.
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there.
Tomorrows gonna be here way too soon.
Let's not waste another minute girl,
I got plans for me and you.
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights.
Baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there.
Oh I can take it from there.
I'm out on the highway, just about a mile away
Meet me out in the driveway
I'm gonna be there soon
I'll swing by and pick you up
Don't bother getting fixed up
Me and you and this old truck will find something to do
No I ain't got no plan in mind
It's such a perfect night so I just thought
We could go get lost
Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost
Come on baby let's go
When we get there we'll know
No bars on the cellphone 
Sounds good to me
We can find us a place to park
By the water underneath the stars 
And do a little "fishin' in the dark"
If you know what I mean
Well all we need's a tank a gas
So grab that GPS and turn it off
Let's go get lost 
Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost
No I ain't got no plan in mind
And it's such a perfect night
So I just thought we could get 
Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
Baby when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
It ain't rained in four months
One cigarette spark'll burn the whole town up
That ole well is plum dry
City put a limit on the water you can buy
We don't mind cause round her
We save water, and drink beer
Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Hollar and Swaller y'all support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer
We're going green hey look at us
We're maybe even doing just a little too much
Poppin' tops, getting' tans
And that's the price we'll pay
Till the long drought ends
We help the world 'round here
We save water, and drink beer
Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Hollar and Swaller y'all support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer
Drink beer
Volunteer, we'll start tonight
Plant a seed, and tell friends
They got to drink a little
Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Holler and Swaller y'all support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer
Say it loud, say it clear
Save water, drink beer
The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is always neon
You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer
But my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
Grand-daddy always said when he was 17
He met the girl, the one in all his dreams
And man that was it was it he never once looked back
He found something he just knew was gonna last
And if you ask him bout that day
He'll just tap his chest
And say
That's how you
When it grabs a hold and won't let go
And you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you it's true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new
He said I walked up to her door
And I was shaking like a leave there on her porch
Till she flashed that smile at me
Son she took my breathe away
And she still does to this day
That's how you know
When it grabs a hold of you and won't let go
When you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you know it's true
When a new love feel old
And an old love feels new
And now I finally see just what he means
Cause that's how I feel
Now that you're with me
That's how I know
Cause you grabbed a hold of me and won't let go
And it feels like you've always been in my soul
That's how you know
When it grabs a hold and won't let go
When you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you know it's true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new
The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you
Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you
Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you
He said son hold it still
Keep that beam shining straight
He'd have a 9/16ths in one hand
Working on that Chevrolet
It seemed like every Saturday
Soon as the sun went down
We'd be huddled underneath that hood
Tinkering around
And of all of the great memories I've had
The best ones are those nights just me and my dad
He'll never how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
Was more about life than fixing cars
Cause to this day I still can't make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just holding the flashlight
He told me a lot of stories
About Grandpa and the war
While he was trying to show me
What a carburator's for
I learned a couple cuss words
When he skinned his knuckles up
And I found out Momma was the only girl
He ever really loved
Then I asked him about women, he just laughed
Said if we stayed out here all year
We wouldn't have time enough for that
He'll never how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
Was more about life than fixing cars
Cause to this day I still can't make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just holding the flashlight
And to this day I still can't make them run right
But deep inside I know that it's all right
'Cause I sure
Just holding the flashlight
Thanks Dad
She turns every head coming down the sidewalk
In that red sundress that she just bought
Causing a traffic jam on a greenlight
A string of pearls showing off her suntan
And all those curls dancing 'round her RayBans
If you think that's something to see
You ought to see her when she's on that front porch
In those cut-off jeans
And that Texas Longhorns t-shirt
Hair drying in the breeze
Humming along to some old Haggard song
You ought to see her when she's on
Down at the office in those high heels
Looking like a million, closing big deals
She'll remind the boys eyes are way up here
Yeah that'll make you smile ear to ear
You ought to see her when she's on that leather couch
Reading that fairy tale
To a sleepy eyed little girl
In pajamas and ponytails
Saying one day your prince charming will come along
You ought to see her when she's on
Oh you ought to see her when she's on that front porch
In those old cut-off jeans
And that Texas Longhorns t-shirt
Smiling back at me
When you see her dressed to kill
And it drops your jaw
You ought to see her when she's on that leather couch
Reading that fairy tale that's when she's on
That's when she's on that front porch
In those old cut-off jeans
That's when she's on
Oh when she's on
That's when she's on
PFG's coming 'cross the creek
Z71, headlights shinin' through the trees
The boys spill out of the back seat
And ask me, what's it gonna be tonight
I said I'm just trying to get loose, trying to make a move
Don't matter what we do
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows where we'll go
And hell I don't care
As long as we're out there
We pulled in, threw it in park
And follow the orange glow in the dark
And the trail marks
Through the fire and flames we locked eyes
She walked over from the other side
And smiled when I said
I'm just trying to get loose, trying to set the mood
Don't matter what we do
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows where we'll go
And baby I don't care
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows where we'll go
And hell I don't care
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there
Cheap boat, 6 pack of something light
A fireball burning up a blue sky
A Mercury 93, wasn't even half past noon
A first taste of freedom after high school
Breaking hearts, curfews and mamma's rules
I just laugh thinking 'bout all the shit we got into
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose
But we did, and we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Lookin' back on the past
Wasn't much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz is all it was
But that's what memories are made of
It's been so long since me and Katy first met
We lost touch as all of the years went
Flying past, fading fast, wishing I could make her mine
There's some things, the same to take you right back
I see her face every time I hear that
Lynyrd Skynyrd vinyl spinning, I'm in her arms in my mind
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose, never lose
But we did, and we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Lookin' back on the past
Wasn't much but it's what we had
Just a good buzz from a summer love was all it was
Yeah, that's what memories are made of
Yeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose
But we did, and we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Lookin' back on the past
Wasn't much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz was all it was
Yeah, a summer love was all it was
But that's what memories are made of
That old phone of mine, 2:39 AM when I got the call
Half asleep, thought it was a dream, but it wasn't after all
That old dog of yours, sitting on the porch, waits for you to come home
Little does he know that you won't be walking through that door
I just leave him alone, cause lettin' go don't come that easily
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
That old rockin' chair sittin' over there, it don't rock no more
And that old six string ain't played a thing, been awhile since it's hummed a chord
Just leave 'em alone cause lettin' go don't come that easily
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
There's a lot of things in this whole world I can stand
But when it comes to losin' you, I just can't
Yeah, I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to, no I'll never get used to you bein' gone
Yeah, bein' gone
I'm never gettin' used to you bein' gone
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
Till I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
I been workin' this job 9 to 5.
Minimum wage and overtime.
But here comes a few days,
Of unpaid vacation.
And there ain't no way, Jose, I'll waste them.
'Cause there ain't no better feeling then when...
I pick up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Friday night y'all here's the plan.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Well I woke up at 1 pm.
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend.
And there's a wrecking ball, sized hole in the wall in the basement.
I ain't got no clue, how or who, coulda made it.
Well all I know is shit hit the fan,
And here we go again...
I pick up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Friday night y'all here's the plan.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Well it's Sunday now and I'm freaking out
'Cause I can't handle five days without...
Yeah, picking up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Sunday who gives a damn.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Like a beer can.
No, nothing picks me up, like a beer can.
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four that I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn't find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue, this one's for you
Mom and Dad, they always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn't help himself
I thank god that they were there to see me through
This one's for you
I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
I've been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and kinda few good friends
Who reminded me of all that I stood to lose
This one's for you
Yeah, I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
Made more than my fare share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned, a few things that I can't change
Some apologies are way past over due
So this one's for you
Oh, I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two

Lookin' back on the past
Wasn't much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz was all it was
Yeah, a summer love was all it was
But that's what memories are made of
That old phone of mine, 2:39 AM when I got the call
Half asleep, thought it was a dream, but it wasn't after all
That old dog of yours, sitting on the porch, waits for you to come home
Little does he know that you won't be walking through that door
I just leave him alone, cause lettin' go don't come that easily
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
That old rockin' chair sittin' over there, it don't rock no more
And that old six string ain't played a thing, been awhile since it's hummed a chord
Just leave 'em alone cause lettin' go don't come that easily
Most of the time I can get by - it's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
There's a lot of things in this whole world I can stand
But when it comes to losin' you, I just can't
Yeah, I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there, at church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin' without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to, no I'll never get used to you bein' gone
Yeah, bein' gone
I'm never gettin' used to you bein' gone
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
Till I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing all right
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
I been workin' this job 9 to 5.
Minimum wage and overtime.
But here comes a few days,
Of unpaid vacation.
And there ain't no way, Jose, I'll waste them.
'Cause there ain't no better feeling then when...
I pick up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Friday night y'all here's the plan.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Well I woke up at 1 pm.
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend.
And there's a wrecking ball, sized hole in the wall in the basement.
I ain't got no clue, how or who, coulda made it.
Well all I know is shit hit the fan,
And here we go again...
I pick up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Friday night y'all here's the plan.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Well it's Sunday now and I'm freaking out
'Cause I can't handle five days without...
Yeah, picking up a beer can.
And get to feeling like Superman.
It's Sunday who gives a damn.
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand,
Any flavor, size or brand.
Until the point where I can't stand.
No nothing picks me up like a beer can.
Like a beer can.
No, nothing picks me up, like a beer can.
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four that I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn't find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue, this one's for you
Mom and Dad, they always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn't help himself
I thank god that they were there to see me through
This one's for you
I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
I've been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and kinda few good friends
Who reminded me of all that I stood to lose
This one's for you
Yeah, I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
Made more than my fare share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned, a few things that I can't change
Some apologies are way past over due
So this one's for you
Oh, I told you all that I'd write you a song
Pour my heart into the melody to keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four that I owe more than a few
Momma raised us by the bible
And washed us in the gospel
Daddy taught us 'bout the bottle
And drug us to the truck pull
I guess you can say we came by it honestly
It's hard to wear the halo when the devil's hanging on your sleeve
Yes it is
We're just some boys on the back porch
Making noise after church 
Watching that race go round
Spend a little time with the Lord in the morning
Raise a little hell when the sun goes down
Fire and brimstone 
Drink our shine homegrown
Caught between lost and found
Yeah we're angels in the am, 
Amen!
But heathens in the evenin'
Yeah we pull out that six string
And mix us up a stiff drink
And we sing about everything
All the way from Jesus to Jennings
We spend one day in Sunday school
Yeah the rest of the week 
We break all the rules
Yeah we do
We're just some boys on the back porch
Making noise after church 
Watching that race go round
Spend a little time with the Lord in the morning
Raise a little hell when the sun goes down
Fire and brimstone 
Drink our shine homegrown
Caught between lost and found
Yeah we're angels in the am, 
Amen!
But heathens in the evenin'
Yeah we sing Amazing Grace
And then we rock this place
We're just some boys on the back porch
Making noise after church 
Watching that race go round
Spend a little time with the Lord in the morning
Raise a little hell when the sun goes down
Fire and brimstone 
Drink our shine homegrown
Caught between lost and found
Yeah we're angels in the am, 
Amen!
But heathens in the evenin'
9 AM came way to fast
My head's pounding like a dynamite blast
Tried to sleep in on Saturday
This hangover is sure having its way
But good thing the dogs are playing UT on the TV
Because that's reason enough for me to get a 6 pack remedy
I got my buzz back now I'm feelin' alright
Ain't nothing gonna hold me down tonight
Because I'm the pilot of this party flight
And I'm callin' my buddies it's going down
Bringing last night's good time back around
With a couple of beers and my good friend Jack.
I got my buzz back, I got my buzz back yeah.
7 digits sitting in my phone
The thought of her won't leave me alone
There was making out and making plans.
And maybe tonight we can do it again
Yeah, I got the nerve to call her up
And say it's me hey cutie how about a bottle of wine
And a movie, and you cuddling up close to me
We got that buzz back and we are feeling alright
And nothing gonna hold us down tonight
Baby come on over let a love take flight
And I'm picking you up and it's going down
Bringing last night's good time back around
With some Chardonnay and a sweet soundtrack.
We got that buzz back, we got that buzz back
Get your buzz back
I got my buzz back, I got my buzz back
I got my buzz back now I'm feelin' alright
Ain't nothing gonna hold me down tonight
Because I'm the pilot of this party flight

Bringing last night's good time back around
With a couple of beers and my good friend Jack.

Ain't nothing gonna hold me down tonight
Because I'm the pilot of this party flight
And I'm callin' my buddies it's going down
Bringing last night's good time back around
With a couple of beers and my old friend Jack.
I got my buzz back, I got my buzz back yeah.
I got my buzz back, I got my buzz back
Everybody get your buzz back.
Get your buzz back, yeah, hey
Get your buzz back, get your buzz back
My head's feeling better already, yes sir.
I like my coffee black.
I sure to hate to shave.
I drink a cold six pack
When I watch my Titans play.
I still cut my own grass.
Always try to get to church.
Sometimes I'm fighting man,
But I love so much it hurts.
Hard headed, stuck in my ways.
I could try my whole life,
But I know I won't change.
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me,
Cause every day it's clearer and I see,
I've got a lot of my old man in me.
Still miss my home town.
I like fishing in the summer rain.
And I've thrown my voice out at more
Than one little league game.
And I'm good with a hammer and nail.
Help my buddies when they get stuck.
Yeah, I've done pretty good for myself,
But I still drive that same old truck.
Hard headed, stuck in my ways.
I could try my whole life,
But I know I won't change.
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me,
Cause every day it's clearer and I see,
I've got a lot of my old man...
And every step I take I know there will come a day
Where lookin' back I'll say I was proud to be...
Hard headed, stuck in my ways.
I could try my whole life,
But I know I won't change.
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me,
Cause every day it's clearer and I see,
A lot of my old man in me.
I see a lot of you, dad.
Dang gum
Look at her
All right
Met a girl in Myrtle beach
On the board walk makin' sweet eyes at me
She could be a Georgia peach, a Bama babe or a Carolina queen
I thought "yeah look at that smile"
Daisy dukes that drive me wild
Backwards camo braves hat on
Cover bands rockin' and she's singin' along
Girl, climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than a man who's sweet
Common girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes
I see a girl country as me
She was hot as fire under neon lights
DTF and lookin' for a good time
We hit the clubs all night
Shut 'em down and watched that sunrise
God bless blue jeans blue eyes
Fallin' in love on a miracle mile
Girl, climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than a man who's sweet
Common girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes
I see a girl country as me
She don't like wine, she likes Jim Beam and Bud Light
Sittin' on a tailgate round a bonfire
On a Oveyne county Saturday night
Climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than you need a man who's sweet
Common girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes I see
When I look into your eyes I see a girl country as me
Country as me
Haha
Girl, backwards hat, daisy dukes, fine as hell
Just my type
No, I don't have side steps
Jump on up into it
Have a good ole time
Now let's get out of here
I grew up in a small town, 10 minutes from the beach
Moved on up to Asheville, the year I turned thirteen
I walked the halls of Reynolds High, man I sure loved high school
And ended up in Chapel Hill wearing Carolina Blue
It's the sunrise on another day over my hometown
It's the smile there on my mama's face cooking dinner at the house
Its hearing my song on the radio with my best friends in my truck
I ain't rich, but I sure got enough, and it beats a million bucks
I still rock that gold belt buckle my dad got me sophomore year
I've got the world's 2 greatest brothers and we can sure throw back some beers
I helped Jimmie win a couple rings on that old Lowe's Cobalt Chevy
And grabbed my guitar and one big dream and moved on to music city
It's the sunrise on another day over my hometown
It's the smile there on my mama's face cooking dinner at the house
Its hearing my song on the radio with my best friends in my truck
I ain't rich, but I sure got enough, and it beats a million bucks
So heres to all my buddies and the ones I ain't met yet
I don't need a lot of money to make me a happy man
Some might call it crazy, some might call it luck
But I just call it my life and it beats a million bucks
It's the sunrise on another day over my hometown
It's the smile there on my mama's face cooking dinner at the house
Its hearing my song on the radio with my best friends in my truck
I ain't rich, but I sure got enough, and it beats a million bucks
Yeah it beats a million bucks
When I saw her for the very first time I was 007 at the age of 9
Hiding in the backseat of my brother's brand new Jeep
There were girls dancin' in the bed of the trucks
At least the ones who weren't gettin' stuck.
Coolers, cans and cut-offs were all new to me
Well that was then, but now I'm grown and how we went that night
I still go when the weekend rolls around
I'll be gettin' down, gettin' loud, gettin' some
Gettin' high up under the moonlight
It's a bring your own booze contribution
We got beer and good ole boys, good ole girls
Gettin' backwards in a backwoods world
Sunday morning we'll have a get-right reunion
Oh but tonight it's on, pass the jar around
Get so far gone we come unwound
We ain't lost we can be found at the dirt road communion
Oh, dirt road communion
It's where I got my first moonshine kiss
I could taste the cinnamon on her lips
In the front seat of my brother's ole hand-me-down jeep
Where I was baptised in rock'n'roll
Our country roots run deep in my soul
We hold one up high every single time Petty sets us free
Yeah, we're gettin' down, gettin' loud, gettin' some
Gettin' high up under the moonlight
It's a bring your own booze contribution
We got beer and good ole boys, good ole girls
Gettin' backwards in a backwoods world.
Sunday morning we'll have a get-right reunion
Oh but tonight it's on, pass the jar around
Get so far gone we come unwound
We ain't lost we can be found at the dirt road communion
Oh, dirt road communion
It's who we are, it's what we do
We all come from miles around
Just to do a little...
Gettin' down, gettin' loud, gettin' some
Gettin' high up under the moonlight
It's a bring your own booze contribution
We got beer and good ole boys, good ole girls
Gettin' backwards in a backwoods world
Sunday morning we'll have a get-right reunion
Oh but tonight it's on, pass the jar around
Get so far gone we come unwound
We ain't lost we can be found at the dirt road communion
Dirt road communion
Oh, dirt road communion
She's a pick me up at six, make you wait 'til eight
Country girl sticker on her Chevrolet
She'd close on an old pine down by the riverbank
Buzz from a cheap wine, first love on a tailgate
A summer night in July, bottle rocket flying high
Fire poppin', body rockin', droppin' under the moonlight.
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.
She likes to get down, sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks, that's how she rolls.
She's a backwards hat, hey boys what's up
Strawberry lipstick from a Dixie cup
A quick silver tan line, riding shot gun in my truck
A charm with a peace sign around her neck for a little luck
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.
She likes to get down, sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks, that's how she rolls.
That's how she rolls.
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Man a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.
She likes to get down, sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks, and that's how she rolls.
Yeah, that's how she rolls.
That's how she rolls.
It's the roses just because, yet just because it's Tuesday
And it's lettin' 'er drive my truck after what she did to the tailgate
And it's holding back her hair after one too many drinks
Yeah, it's the little things
Oh, it's the little things
No, she doesn't need a 4 karat diamond ring or a big house to come home to
No, she doesn't need a Hollywood movie scene or a sunset everyday in Malibu
No, all she needs are the little things
And it's watching that damn bachelor every Monday night
And loving her like I don't have her can shut me up even when I'm right
And it's playing her this new song I just wrote home in sol sick string
Yeah, it's the little things
Oh, it's the little things
No, she doesn't need a 4 karat diamond ring or a big house to come home to
No, she doesn't need a Hollywood movie scene or a sunset everyday in Malibu
No, all she needs are the little things
17 through 22, runnin' wild through the streets with an attitude
Down to Tiger Town Tavern and that old tin roof, thinkin' we were cool
With fake ID's and on daddy's dime
Yea we made it to class when we made the time
Hopin' usually we had a little more to minds,
Like them tailgates Saturdays and Friday nights
We were young and in love every single week
Learnin' more about life a man could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all we need to get us far
Yea, we were lookin' like rockstars, shuttin' down bars
From PBJ's and PBR's
They send a car gig every other Thursday
Wouldn't make a penny but we tried to play
And canvas on Ferolli's then count attorneys
Give all and he'd better run for his money
We were young and in love every single week
Learnin' more about life a man could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all need to get us far
Yea, we were lookin' like rockstars, shuttin' down bars
From PBJ's and PBR's
Now lookin' back on those days
I wouldn't change a thing
Yea, we were young and in love every single week
Learnin' more about life a man could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all need to get us far
And it sure got us far
Young and in love every single week
Learnin' more about life a man could ever teach
Couple dollars and some freedom was all need to get us far
Yea, we were lookin' like rockstars, shuttin' down bars
From PBJ's and PBR's
Sweet like a Georgia peach, wild as a honeysuckle
Under them jeans she's hidin' a little somethin' somethin'
She got it going on, she like her drink strong
Yeah she's a hook line in a hit song
Can't get her out of my head, she's like a melody
Stuck on the beat she got me singin' singin' singin'
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah the fire in her eyes got me hypnotized like...
Whoa! whoa! whoa!
And it's burning me up but it feels so right
When she's ready to rock you know I'm ready to roll
She's got the beat to freeze my soul like...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hotter than a summer night, cooler than a caddy
She got me fallin' faster than the autumn leaves
She puts the sugar sweet in my sweet tea
She got me buzzin' like American honey bee
Can't get her out of my head, she's like a melody
Stuck on the beat she got me singin' singin' singin'
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah the fire in her eyes got me hypnotised like...
Whoa! whoa! whoa!
And it's burning me up but it feels so right
When she's ready to rock you know I'm ready to roll
She's got the beat to freeze my soul like...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Like a honeysuckle, honey bee
Like Daisy Duke's and the General Lee
Like a Georgia peach she tastes so sweet
Sweep a country boy right off his feet
Got me buzzed like a truck in mud
Like a bucket full of buds and suds
Really wanna know what it is, what it was
Cause look at her, let me tell you 'cause
She's so fine like Carolina moonshine
Can't hold a light or candle to her
Cause baby what she do is like
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah the fire in her eyes got me hypnotised like...
Whoa! whoa! whoa!
And it's burning me up but it feels so right
When she's ready to rock you know I'm ready to roll
She's got the beat to freeze my soul like...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I'm just four walls with a little paint, a picture here or there
I got a Bible in my dresser, just in case somebody cares
I've been here forever, 1959
My name is on the front door, they call me 205
And man you can't imagine, the things that happen here
I've seen my share of laughing and I've seen a lot of tears
Drug deals and last meals and love that seemed so real
Until I saw the flash of those hundred dollar bills
But let me tell you something crazy, that I'd never seen before
Starts with Johnny and Katie, first time they walked through my door
It was a Friday night, late fall
After a high school football game
They snuck away, in a beat up Chevrolet
Yeah they made love for the first time,
Till that Carolina sun came up
That's where it all began
At the Conway Motor Inn
Well they lit a cigarette, and talked about their lives
Said they were getting married, after graduation night
It all seemed so perfect, but they didn't have a clue
That one be one of them would be right back here with someone new
Now fast forward four years, and that white picket fence
It ain't holding out what it should be keeping in
See, I see Katie on the weekends, when Johnny's working nights
And the man she's coming here with, ain't the man I recognize
It was a Friday night, late fall
After a high school football game
They snuck away, in her lover's Escalade
Yeah they made love for the first time,
Till Johnny's graveyard shift was up
Both livin' in sin
At the Conway Motor Inn
Tonight Johnny ain't working, 'cause he's right here with me
With a pistol in his right hand, just waitin' on the key
To turn in my door, and when they both walk in
He lays that hammer down, and that's where this story ends
It was a Friday night, late fall
After a high school football game
They snuck away, in a beat up Chevrolet
Yeah they made love for the first time,
Till that Carolina sun came up
That's where it all began
And that's where it all ends
At the Conway Motor Inn
At the Conway Motor Inn
I've been here forever, 1959
My name is on the front door, they call me 205
I hold this guitar like a shotgun
Under bright lights, on a stage every Friday night
And if you wanna tell your boss man
To kiss your ass you're in the right place now
And I wanna know if you came down here from a dirt road
If so, hold one highest
We're all here for a good time
Boys, if you're ready to get rock, we don't stop
We poppin' off like a bottle rocket most shots
Girls, will do me a favor, pour another Yeager, shake your money maker
I'm just a country boy singin' my song
So come on y'all, sing along
Pop a top off and get your good time on
Pop pop a top off and get your good time on
Just so you know that we're on the same page
Got a nice cold beer up here on this stage
If y'all don't mind if I partake then wait
Here we go, now we're ready to roll
It's on with the show, throw your hands up and sing
Hey hey
Boys, if you're ready to get rock, we don't stop
We poppin' off like a bottle rocket most shots
Girls, will do me a favor, pour another Yeager, shake your money maker

So come on y'all, sing along
Pop a top off and get your good time on
Pop pop a top off and get your good time on
Boys, if you're ready to get rock, we don't stop
We poppin' off like a bottle rocket most shots
Girls, will do me a favor, pour another Yeager, shake your money maker
I'm just a country boy singin' my song
So come on y'all, sing along
Pop a top off and get your good time on
Pop pop a top off and get your good time on
I said pop a top off and get your good time on
Pop pop a top off and get your good time on
Layin' in my bed, alarm goin' off
Get my feet on the floor, turn the TV on CNN
That stock markets down again
All about who's who, who's got what
Get your name up the ladder, get that extra buck
Yeah their American dream
It's all about the green
Over where I come from
It's a little different son.
It's the color of the tractor in my barn
A fifty acre pasture, ole' horse farm
And rows of pines as far as I can see
It ain't the money in the bank that we ain't got
Na, it's the clover growin' in my deer plot
And her eyes everyday lookin' back at me
Yeah, that's my shades of green...
Hangin' in the woods with an ole' bird dog
Us boys 'round here where'd ever fall from head to toe
Yeah, that's the way we roll
And some put it on with the gun in their hands
And wear it each day, fightin' for this land
Like my daddy did. that was back in '66
It's the color of the tractor in my barn
A fifty acre pasture, ole' horse farm
And rows of pines as far as I can see
It ain't the money in the bank that we ain't got
Na, it's the clover growin' in my deer plot
And her eyes every day lookin' back at me
Yeah, that's my shades of green...
Yeah it's all around, from big cities to small towns...
It's the color of the tractor in my barn
A fifty acre pasture, ole' horse farm
And rows of pines as far as I can see
It ain't the money in the bank that we ain't got
Na, it's the clover growin' in my deer plot
And her eyes every day lookin' back at me
Oh it's her eyes everyday lookin' back at me
Yeah, that's my shades of green...
Oh yeah, that's a country boys shade of green
Layin' in my bed, alarm goin' off
Get my feet on the floor, turn the TV on CNN
That stock market's down again
He said, "Boy you ever been outside of this town?
Ever thought about gettin' out to the west coast?
Or down to Mexico?"
I said, "No."
I just stood there pumpin' his gas while he rambled on somethin' 'bout Paris, France
And the Northern Lights
And how they dance at night
And how I'm missin' out on life.
He said, "You ain't livin' yet."
That's when I said,
"If you've never snuck a kiss in a hayloft,
Drove your pickup truck with your shirt off,
Or let the rooster crow be your alarm clock,
Then you ain't livin' yet.
You've never thrown a line out from a jon boat,
Got a little sideways on a dirt road,
A little choked up on a Marlboro,
Then you ain't livin' yet.
Nah, you ain't livin' yet."
I popped the hood on his Cadillac
And checked the oil
While he just laughed and said, "You're right,
I've never tried anything like that before."
And I said,
"I can tell by the Mardi Gras beads
And the stack of road maps in your back seat
You've been everywhere,
But man I swear
This place is different than anywhere."
I told him, "You ain't livin' yet,
Now tell me this,
You ever put a buckshot through a stop sign?
Felt the burn from your first sip of moonshine?
Revved your engine up at a red light?
Then you ain't livin' yet.
You ever thrown your voice out at a tractor pull?
Seen a hot girl ride a mechanical bull?
Poured your heart out on a bar stool?
Then you ain't livin' yet."
He said, "Son, you've got me thinkin',
Thinkin' I might just stick around.
By the way you talk, there's a world I've never seen inside of this town.
Should let me take a look around
And trade this Cadillac for a step side,
Grab an RC Cola and Moonpie
And just soak up this country life,
'Cause I ain't livin' yet
You're right man when you said
That you ain't livin' yet.
'Cause I ain't livin' yet."
Nah, you ain't livin' yet.
A couple Pocahontas legs peakin' out a swimmin' hole
Solo blockin' shots under that soccer goal
Cheerlead her pop-poms on a Saturday night
That's a country boy's kryptonite
A little caramel colored honey, whiskey in a glass
Couple bucks down and a couple bears back
Don't it get a little lip sippin' umber the light
That's a country boy's kryptonite
I can't resist it, I'm addicted
Even Superman would lose his fire
Yeah, all it is, it's my weakness
It's a country boy's kryptonite oh yeah
Cobra county mud fool kickin' up spray
A Sunday afternoon in a checkered flag ways
And a 12 point bucks sittin' in a plus sign
That's a country boy's kryptonite
I can't resist it, I'm addicted
Even Superman would lose his fire
Yeah, all it is, it's my weakness
It's a country boy's kryptonite
Feeling's good, rich brand new Justin's
My baby in a ball cap, that's where it's at
I can't resist it, I'm addicted
Even Superman would lose his fire
Yeah, all would guess it's my weakness
It's a country boy's kryptonite
I can't resist it, I'm addicted
Even Superman would lose his fire
Yeah, all it is, it's my weakness
It's all the country boy's kryptonite
It's all the country boy's kryptonite
On a highway in a town north of Atlanta
That radio, it stopped me in my tracks
It was a song I sang, a song I wrote
A couple of years back for ya
And it got me thinkin' of how I miss my Georgia
'Cause you're in every song I sing, you're in everything I do
In every breath I take and every I miss you
But I couldn't do a damn thing
No right words that I could say
I couldn't keep you here with a melody and now you're just a memory
But girl you'll always be, in every song I sing
I lived a life and love that you had grown to hate
I had a love affair with the road a stage and my six string
And though I couldn't keep you here, I done all that I could do
And yet you're gone tonight but this song I write it's about you
'Cause you're in every song I sing, you're in everything I do
In every breath I take and every I miss you
But I couldn't do a damn thing
No right words that I could say
I couldn't keep you here with a melody and now you're just a memory
But girl you'll always be, in every song I sing
I hope you know every night I take that stage
Girl I'd given up it all to make you stay
But I keep you in my heart in my own way
Through every song I sing, through everything I do
Through every breath I take and every I miss you
Oh but I couldn't do a damn thing
No right words that I could say
I couldn't keep you here with a melody and now you're just a memory
But girl you'll always be, in every song I sing
She takes her sweet time when she gets ready
Singin' to a hairbrush "Free Fallin'" with Petty
Walks out with her hair done, I'm like "Woo, damn!"
Keep takin' your time lookin' fine like only a country girl can
Oh, yeah
She get a little wild on a Saturday night
And those pretty little eyes get wide when she sees the light
After she's had a few she's ready to dance
And she can shake it, break it down, get 'em loud like only a country girl can
She turns every head when she walks by
Lights up the room with her pretty smile
But you better stay away when she gets mad
'Cause she can make your world fall apart
When she loves she loves with all her heart
And that makes me a lucky man
She can do no wrong, turn me on like only a country girl can
Come on!
She ain't afraid to get a little dirt on her hands
She hop on my tractor while I'm plowin' the land
Rolls up her sleeves workin' on that farmer's tan
But she can rock the boots in her daisy dukes like a country girl can
She turns every head when she walks by
Lights up the room with her pretty smile
But you better stay away when she gets mad
'Cause she can make your world fall apart
When she loves she loves with all her heart
And that makes me a lucky man
She can do no wrong, turn me on like only a country girl can
She turns every head when she walks by
Lights up the room with her pretty smile
But you better stay away when she gets mad
'Cause she can make your world fall apart
When she loves she loves with all her heart
And that makes me a lucky man
She can do no wrong, turn me on like only a country girl can
I said she can do no wrong, turn me on like only a country girl can
Yeah baby

Baby, I've seen that look in your eye
Try to cover it up, there ain't no disguise to hide
What's goin' on right here
So come on girl, what do you say?
We head for 11 south in my Chevrolet
Hop in the back, it ain't no crime
If I get to know all of your tan lines
Yeah, you and me, backseat on a bad road
Wastin' no time, foggin' up the windows
I never thought a Z71 could feel this damn good and be this much fun
But there you go again, doin' your thing
And you know how to do it, if you know what I mean
Baby buckle up tight, tonight it's you and me
Shakin' the wheels off of my Chevy
Well, look out girl, we got the whole town talkin'
Everybody's wonderin', wishin', and wantin' to know,
What's goin' on down that road?
But it's our little secret, our little thing
You could call it love or you could call it a fling,
All I know is this sure as hell feels right
When my truck hits park under that moonlight
Yeah, you and me, backseat on a bad road
Wastin' no time, foggin' up the windows
I never thought a Z71 could feel this damn good and be this much fun
But there you go again, doin' your thing
And you know how to do it, if you know what I mean
Baby buckle up tight, tonight it's you and me
Shakin' the wheels off of my Chevy
Well, my foot's on the floorboard,
Yeah, we're movin' pretty fast,
Girl, the way you're lookin' in my Carolina shirt,
Right now you know I just hate hold back
Yeah, you and me, backseat on a back road
Fingers streakin' through the fog on the windows
I never thought a Z71 to feel this damn good and be this much fun
But there you go again, doin' your thing
And you know how to do it, if you know what I mean
Baby buckle up tight, tonight it's you and me
Shakin' the wheels off of my Chevy
Shake it girl, come on
I see ya,
You're wearin' that backwards Braves hat I like so much
Yeah, come on, get out of here
Aw, shake 'em off girl
Lately I've been trading a good sermon and some prayin'
For a stranger in my bed and a night that needs explainin'
I've opened more bottles then I ever have my bible
This dirt road communion sure won't lead me to revival
Between the black label and the letters in red
I've felt what livin' is and what it's like to live dead
I've taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I've been so high thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far-gone
A ringing in my head's the 23rd psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only God knows where my heart is
I've got my strength, and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh, I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniel's and Jesus
It's my fault that I ain't called my momma in a month on Sundays
She'd smell the whiskey through that phone
I can't stand to hear her heart break
Next week I see my brother Casey for the first time
Since it all went down and I blacked his eye the night after our daddy died
I've taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I've been so high thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far-gone
A ringing in my head's the 23rd psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only God knows where my heart is
I've got my strength, and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh, I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniel's and Jesus
I ain't afraid to admit I've hit rock bottom
If you wanna see a lifetime full of sins
Just look at me, I've got 'em
I've taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I've been so high thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far-gone
A ringing in my head's the 23rd psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only God knows where my heart is
I've got my strength, and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh, I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniel's and Jesus
Tonight's Janie's pourin' the Smirnoff
Guess Billie's got the nights off
Yet rumor has it his ex-wife Catherine put his truck in the ditch
And there's a new owner, Joe what's his face
Last December, he bought this place
His girlfriend Jessie, she sure is sexy
But she can sure be a bitch
And I don't know why but I still buy drinks for two
Make 'er scrate for me, men would lie for her
But that don't put her back in this barstool
And the beer's still warm
All year 'round can't catch a buzz from the suds
And the tears they're pourin' down on me
Send me out to sea and take me to a place where the whiskey's a little more sour
I guess happy hour ain't so happy without her
That same damn skin her cover band
Playin' sweet home Alabama
For the third time tonight (they still playin' it too slow)
We used to dance all night long
She swore it was her favorite song
But now I guess, Joe's girl Jess is the star of the floor
And the tourists backed this place out
Ride around since
I still be drinkin' at this bar
And I'll be gone by then
And the beer's still warm
All year 'round can't catch a buzz from the suds
And the tears they're pourin' down on me
Send me out to sea and take me to a place where the whiskey's a little more sour
I guess happy hour ain't so happy without her
So close in on up, here's the cash for my tab
Don't you worry 'bout me, though I am callin' a cab and I ain't never comin' back
I know I said that last night
I said that a thousand times
But the beer's still warm
All year 'round can't catch a buzz from the suds
And the tears they're pourin' down on me
Send me out to sea and take me to a place where the whiskey's a little more sour
I guess happy hour ain't so happy without her
I guess happy hour ain't so happy without her
I ain't seen you around
In a long long time
Why's that, I can't really recall
No reason to rhyme
Oh wait, yes I can
She never called me back
She must've gone find you another man to fall for your act
No you're so friendly
When you see me
Sittin' up here at this bar
A keg deep in drinks
And you really wanna know if you can join me
Hell no!
No, you can't sit here
No, I'm drinkin' this beer
'Cause you and all you done to me
Now you seem so sad, you say you missed me bad
You think it's all good, but girl, I disagree
Now you wanna share a glass 'cause you must be high on grass
You can kiss my ass
Maybe a little harsh
Yes, I'll admit it
I took that one a little bit too far
But I couldn't resist
I'm caught in your act
Hung on your bullshit
Now you wanna know if I'll be your friend
Oh girl, not one bit
What's that I see?
Could that be a tear?
Rollin' down your cheek
All right baby, come on over here
And you can join me for just one drink
Oh wait, never mind
No, you can't sit here
No, I'm drinkin' this beer
'Cause you and all you done to me
Now you seem so sad, you say you missed me bad
You think it's all good, but girl, I disagree
Now you wanna share a glass 'cause you must be high on grass
You can kiss my ass
No, I ain't got no problems with you
No, the problem's you
When you ask me how I've been
Honey ain't it clear?
You can't sit here
No, I'm drinkin' this beer
'Cause you can all you done for me
Now you seem so sad, you say you missed me bad
You think it's all good, but girl, I disagree
Now you wanna share a glass 'cause you must be high on grass
You go on and kiss my ass
Yeah, you
You, kiss my ass

Sun sinking down, stars getting brighter
Fireflies dancing like free fall lighters
Set the mood for a good time nighter

Rocking and dropping,
Bumping cans spilling, tripping, slipping, and popping,
You know us, you know we ain't stopping.

She's a pick me up at six, make you wait 'til eight
Country girl sticker on her Chevrolet
She'd close on an old pine down by the riverbank
Buzz from a cheap wine, first love on a tailgate
A summer night in July, bottle rocket flying high
Fire poppin', body rockin', droppin' under the moonlight.
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.
She likes to get down, sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks, that's how she rolls.
She's a backwards hat, hey boys what's up
Strawberry lipstick from a Dixie cup
A quick silver tan line, riding shot gun in my truck
A charm with a peace sign around her neck for a little luck
My baby's all hands in the air and don't have a care
When her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a RayBan's stare just about everywhere we go.

Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks, that's how she rolls.

I woke up with her in my arms this morning
God knows, I love her over all
As she whispered she loved me, your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
You were here, we loved, but now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones all be bygones, yes, and stay gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Tonight I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
I closed my eyes to kiss her your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
You were here, we loved, but now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones all be bygones, yes, and stay gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
So now it's over, and you're free
You've left your little boy and me
You say you're tired of staying home
And you can make it on your own
I thought this family was your life
You're a new woman, not a wife
And now you're chasin' a new dream
Found in a Cosmo magazine
That little guy and I will find our way
We never really knew you anyway
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
I spent a lifetime lovin' you
Or was it just a year or two
The girl I thought had clipped her wings
Lived only in my boyish dreams
Someday they'll say your son looks just like you
But you'll never know if what they say is true
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
It's just the times, not what we've done
Daddy had a 1969 Ford and I was just bout ten years old
We would listen to Jones and Haggard on the radio
He sang these things I still care to a girl he used to know
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing the "Workin Man Blues"
I never met ol' Merle, but we were awful close
I cut my teeth on "Swinging Door" and "And Momma Tried To Sing Me Home"
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I may be ragged but I'm right
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night
Ol' George sure put a lot of heart in the songs he sang
And every time daddy got a little bit tired
"Walk Through This World" would make him proud
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing "The Workin Mam Blues"
I never met ol' Merle but we was awful close
I cut my teeth on "Swinging Door" and "And Momma Tried To Sing Me Home"
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
Ol' George and Merle they raised my country soul
Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
The look in your eye pulls me apart
Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
Oh and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then loose you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to Heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
I don't need Havanna cigars
Fancy C-cars or premium beer
I smoke whatever's cheap
Keep my ol' gas heater and drink what's here
Oh, the finer things in life don't thrill me much
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love is waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff
I could keep another lover undercover, she'd never know
But everything I long for is benhind my own door
And I love her so
And when that loving feeling gets to me
There's just one place I wanna be
I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love, waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff
I go home and break out the good stuff
All the good love, waiting for me
Anything less than her ain't nearly enough love
So I go home and break out the good stuff...
Well you'd never know it
By looking at them
That she was the woman
That walked in with him
He danced every dance
While she watched from her chair
And he carried on
Like she wasn't there
Well she was a beauty
And I thought to myself
What a fool he must be
To want someone else
Well I watched and I waited
Till the time was just right
And I walked away with
The steal of the night
Like a thief I slipped in
To take what I could
Now I should feel guilty
But I just feel good
And while he two-timed and he two-stepped
We slipped out of sight
And I walked away with
The steal of the night
Yeah, I walked away with the steal of the night
I'll do anything I can to keep our love together one more time
Sorry I deceived you
You made it hard for me to stay in line
Loving you came easy, but for reasons I'll explain I drift away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out 
The mice will play
Last week you went to Vegas with your friends
And left me here alone
I didn't mind you leavin' 
But it hurts when you don't call me when you're gone
See my mind begins to wander
And I'll find someone to take the hurt away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
The mice will play
Loving you came easy, but for reasons I've explained I drift away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
The mice will play
Lately, it seems that the love that you once had in your eyes
Is now all but gone
'Cause when I reach to hold you
Your always so cold to me
Darlin' what have I done wrong
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
Well baby, maybe, you couldn't care less
But darlin', I couldn't care more
Maybe, there been times I hurt you and for that I'm so sorry
What else can I say
Do help us, get back to
The love that we once knew
Oh darlin' don't throw us away
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
Well baby, maybe, you couldn't care less
But darlin', I couldn't care more
Yeah, baby, maybe you couldn't care less
Oh, but darlin' I couldn't care more
They call me a playboy
As I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright light
Of each night spot in town
Though I never show it,
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
With somebody new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
With somebody new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you...
As we listened to the Opera when I was just a kid.
My daddy talked through Saturday's them crazy things he did.
He said this is a story, how your Mamma first met me
And the going thing was Texas swing before Bob Will's was king
Was in the town of Tulsa about 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in old Oklahoma
Well the dust was blowing but the music was right
And W Lee O'Daniel played it all night
For The Light Crust Dough Boys and W. Lee O'Dan
We drove 80 miles through that blowing sand
My '37 Chevy was shootin' steam
Coming up them hill it just seized up on me
And I wouldn't miss a thing on Saturday night
We're all in the chevy's in that Detroit light
I can hear that music in my ears
I was ready to go and I was shifting them gears
So your mamma passed the biscuits and gave me her hand
Knew she was my honey and she knew I was her man
We listenned to the fiddler he was making it sing
And heard them pretty notes of that guitar ring
I had no trouble, was fealing no pain
That moon shine whiskey and your mamma in my van
And The Light Crust Dough Boys and old Pappy Dan
Played us a song, we'll never forget
At the time they were tough and money was tight
But I didn't care on Saturday night
Had no money but I could sang a blues
I felt like dancin' down in my shoes
Was in the town of Tulsa by 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in the old Oklahoma
When the dust was blowing but music was right
And W Lee o'Daniel played it all night
I can see that you havn't recovered
From the girl who let you down
You would sell what is left of your soul
For another go 'round.
You keep telling yourself she means nothing
Maybe you should call her bluff
But if you don't really mean it
You must not be drinking enough.
Well, the perfume she wore
You can buy down at the five and dime
But on some other woman
It don't smell the same in your mind.
You keep telling yourself you can take it
You tell yourself that you're tough
But if you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough.
You're not drinking enough,
To wash away old memories
And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas
To keep you from beggin', please, please, please.
She passed on your passion, stepped on your pride
It turns out you ain't quite so tough
'Cause you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough.
You heard this grown man cry
You ask yourself why
'Cause you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough.
Ay - yi - yi - yi
Ask yourself why
You still wanna hold her
You must no be drinkin' enough...
Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And I won a whole lot more than one night of romance
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.
Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.
I held the ace of hearts that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold a winning hand
Anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose 'cause I got you
My ace of hearts.
I'm gonna hold on to
My ace of hearts...
Cowboys don't cry, and heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
And love is a sweet dream, that always comes true
Oh if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue
But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true, but the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl, here in the real world
I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart, when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen, it'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through, like I hoped we would
But here in the real world, it's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true, but the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl, here in the real world
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
The lady I love, loves silk and satin
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's Saks Fifth Avenue perfection
Caviar and dignified
Well, I live my life in Wal Mart fashion
And I like my sushi southern fried
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's a blue blooded woman, I'm a redneck man...
Excuse me
Ma'am can you help me?
I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am
Tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away
What's that?
No, this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am
I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read
Wanted
One good hearted woman
To forgive inperfections
In the man that she loves
Wanted
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
What's that?
No, that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am
She means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words
Wanted
One good hearted woman
To forgive inperfections
In the man that she loves
Wanted
Just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough
Wanted
Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rockin' in the cradle
To the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought
I'd ever really take it this far
Singin' in the bars
And chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston
For a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killin' me
Half the time, I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, Lord
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standin' in the spotlight
Chasin' that neon rainbow
I'm livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Daddy's got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said, "Son, I just know
We're gonna hear you singin' on it some day"
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
I'm livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Oh, I'm chasin' that neon rainbow
Livin' that honky tonk dream
Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke 
Beneath them neon lights
And she don't like those hurtin' songs
'Cause she's already lived 'em
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em
Well she checks her broken heart there at the door
She ain't looking for romance,
She's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool
That gets caught up in her rhythm
'Cause she don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She's been on the losing end of love too many times 
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She's been on the losing end of love too many times 
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues, she gives 'em
No, she don't get the blues, Lord she gives 'em...
Has it been ten years
Since we said "I do"
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said
"Till death do us part"
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well, we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you're long gone
You left me and the river here all alone
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues
Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the hall
And washed your picture right off the wall
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues
Well, my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
If you change your mind honey I'll be here 
Waiting on the banks of that ole Dog River
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues
For I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues...
In small town down in Georgia
Over 40 years ago
Her maiden name was Musey
Until she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind
And they made their house from a toolshed
Grandaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us 'bout good living
And taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home
My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength in faith of God
And a love of family
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two
And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And let 'em look underneath the hood
And they made their house from a toolshed
Grandaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us 'bout good living
And taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home
There'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home
I could see it coming from a mile away,
A heartache looking for a place to stay.
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool,
The Lord made a woman to make a man a fool.
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
I was drunk and crazy by her sweet perfume,
But I knew stone sober I was being used.
Now, the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne,
She took all she wanted and she was gone.
Well, It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
It was almost worth it for the time we spent,
'Cause there ain't no future in a heart for rent.
Still she taught me something 'bout the facts of life,
That love cuts quicker than a switch- blade knife.
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
A short sweet ride on a runaway train...
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request?
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
I ain't got nothin'
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money, babe
Play a song for me
And don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Yeh, don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style
Can we pull out those old feelin's
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust
That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair
That's all I need to know
Do you wanna stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
And then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord, I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
Oh, how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh, if Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
Midnight in Montgomery, silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat, took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up, and he was gone, was he ever really there
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that Whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there
Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that Whip-poor-will
And see the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there
Yeah, he's always singing there
Oh Hank's always singing, there
I called my doctor on the telephone
"Help me doctor, there's something wrong
I can't shake it, it's gone too far"
He said, "Tell me what your symptoms are"
I said "My hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
I can't eat and I can't sleep
It's turning me every way but loose"
He said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
No doubt, love's got a hold on you"
I told my buddies I was settling down
No more of this running 'round
They looked at me like I was a fool
And said "Come on tell us what's wrong with you"
I said "My hands are sweaty and my knees are week
I can't eat and I can't sleep
It's turning me every way but loose"
He said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
No doubt, love's got a hold on you"
Well, I tossed and turned till the morning light
Holding my pillow, hanging on for life
There ain't nothing I can do
They said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you"
"Well, my hands are sweaty and my knees are week
I can't eat and I can't sleep
It's turning me every way but loose"
He said, "It sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
Sounds like love's got a hold on you
No doubt love's got a hold on you"
She looked me in the eye and said it's over
I can't take this heartache, anymore
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before
And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
There's nothin' in this world, I wouldn't do
Just give me time, I'll be the man you've needed
She said I wish that I could take that, for the truth
And I said someday, I'll get my life straight
And she said it's too late, what's done is done
And I told her someday, she said I can't wait
'Cause sometimes someday, just never comes
She said all I've ever wanted, was to love you
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
But now I think it's time I stopped believin'
'Cause I'm never gonna see a change in you
And I said someday, I'll get my life straight
And she said it's too late, what's done is done
And I told her someday, she said I can't wait
'Cause sometimes someday just never comes
Sometimes someday just never comes
I parked my car 'round back
I've got the shades pulled down
I told everybody including my mama
I was leaving town
But I've been right here
Since you've been gone
Belly-up at the bottom of a bottle
Listening to George Jones
And just playin' possum
Laying low
I've got hundred watts of hurtin'
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
Nowhere I want to go
I'm just playin' possum
And laying low
I'm gonna hide my heart
And be a love recluse
Oh I could cry on my best friend's shoulder
But there ain't no use
I need an expert on
The pain I'm going through
So I'll keep George on the old turntable
'Til I'm over you
And just playin' possum
Laying low
I've got hundred watts of hurtin'
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
Nowhere I want to go
I'm just playin' possum
And laying low
He's playin' possum
And he's laying low
Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distance
There's a lady living right above me
Pretty as a picture on the wall
Once I helped her with a bag of groceries
We met a time or two out in the hall
She told me somebody hurt her feelings
The hurt that's in her eyes is plain to see
Slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
Walkin' the floor over me
Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me
Back and forth I followed every footstep
Countin' long enough to fall asleep
Had the sweetest dream last night 'cause I dreamt
She was walkin' the floor over me
Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me
That woman is walkin' the floor over me
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today
Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther; I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
'Cause my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas they call me "big poppa"
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
Just gonna prop up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today
She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And the pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin' why it is, I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
Now when she loves me
Girl, that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me I can live forever
And when she loves me I am untouchable
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you, I do"
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit spokane
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early
Morning rain
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
My eyes been stung with dust and blind
Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same
Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair
Blood in my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene
Been so long since I seen your face
Or felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this here suitcase for way too long
A man needs something he can hold onto
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
Either one of them things will do
Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair
Blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene
There's a place, where the boat leaves from
It takes away all your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
Take one part sand, and one part sea, one part shade of a big palm tree
The drinks they're cold and the ladies are hot
And I know this is the place for me
So get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
See the problem is that you're down there
And there's a perfectly good island somewhere
Where a ride that floats and don't grab your coats
You won't need them where we are going
So get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
Pick me up
Out on a boat that is huge
Pick me up
I don't know how to do
Pick me up
Put me down
Down on the sand where its cool
Put me down
When I fall off my stool
Put me down
I'll just sleep there till morning comes around
With sunshine and ladies and pina colodas
And Bob Marley songs that are playing
There's a sound in my ear that I want you to hear
Soft tropical lips that are saying
Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
A man was bothering me today
And I wanted to tell him to go away
But I stood and listened to him anyway, OK?
He said he didn't want to shoot that man
And it was his thing and I wouldn't understand
And he had done all that he can, OK?
OK...
I guess his body was as good as mine
And just like me, he was wasting time
Turning over every stone to see what he could find, OK?
He was filling tank and he asked for money
I lied and said I didn't have any
Then my conscience took over and gave him a handful of change
Don't do a thing (don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll lie there (you'll lie there)
You don't seem to care
Yeah!
I know it's hard to survive in the city
When beautiful days don't look so pretty
And you don't have windows to keep the night away, OK?
He was dirty and stinky and just a bit crude
But I didn't say that because that's kind of rude
And he didn't care what I had to say in the first place
OK...
I wanted to say you're a big disgrace
To the world, yourself, and the human race
And reach back and pop him one good time in the face, OK?
No, it's not OK and I didn't do that
But I gave him a smile and tipped my hat
And told him to have a very nice rest of the day
Don't do a thing (don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll lie there (you'll lie there)
You don't seem to care
Get 'em!
I guess he bought some booze with it
And sure, that bothers me a little bit
But it's his life and I can't tell him how to live it (that's right)
As he turned and started to go his way
I tried to think of something wise to say like...
Don't do a thing (don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll die there (you'll die there)
'Cause you don't seem to care
You'll die there (you'll die there)
You don't seem to care
So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you
And we'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just me and you
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
Though we don't have a lot of money
All we need is love
We're free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you
You know I like my chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in Southern ground
And a little bit o' chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit o' chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I've seen a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get ya little chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this
Way?
I was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to
Now I'm sittin' here going crazy trying to crawl back to
You
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way?
But I was smart enough to come to my senses
Be who you need me to be
And if you say that I'm too late
I'll curl up and die in misery
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way
I remember our first kiss on the 4th of July
I'll never miss another one of those
I'll be by your side
If my foolish heart was wrong,
This truly was never meant to be
Well I only hope that he'll count his lucky stars
And love you as much as me
She'll make a train take a dirt road
Or make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind
She's a lawyers queen
And a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine a different kind of fine
Cadillacs and Caviar
Well that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks
She sure don't need those
She's a cool drink of water
When the summer's mean
Poured into those Levi jeans
She's country as the day is long
Tan and lean like a longneck bottle
In the passenger seat got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there
Right on time
Lord take you down to Tijuana
Make you wanna slap ya mama
Got ya all tore up
Made you spill your dip cup
A bona fide a different kind of fine
Lord Lord
I ride east every other Friday
But if I had it my way
A day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along
So I drive and I think about my life
And wonder why that I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around
Right at the Georgia line 
And I count the days
And the miles back home to you 
On that Highway 20 ride
A day might come you'll realize
That if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But, son, please don't mistake me
For a man that didn't care at all
And I drive and I think about my life
And wonder why that I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around
Right at the Georgia line 
And I count the days
And the miles back home to you 
On that Highway 20 ride
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was the pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride
20 ride
20 ride
Highway 20 ride
On that ride
"You thought we were done, huh?
We got more!"
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour ready to fry
My dog Pete is the smallest dog
Of all the dogs in my yard (that's right)
He's a mean som bitch, drinks Beam and water
From a broken mason jar
And we sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour ready to fry
I heard this awful noise comin' outta the woods
(Comin' outta the woods)
I heard chicken screams and I knew it wasn't gon' be good
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken 'cause I just heard him cry
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
But you can get another one for a dollar seventy nine
In a couple of years, his spurs had grown
He wasn't safe to keep around the home
And he almost took an eyeball from Lonnie's son
And I was in the kitchen makin' fig preserves
And I heard that young'un get kicked in the face
And I knew it was a day that rooster's gonna get what he deserves
So I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken and Pete hit him from the side
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
And me and Pete suppered on a homemade chicken pot pie
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch those feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time
"You damn right I like my chicken fried, yeah!"
She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make you wonder which way to go to
Make a man change his mind.
She's a lawyer's queen and a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine
Cadillacs and caviar, well that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks, she sure don't need those

She's a lawyer's queen and a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growin'
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever ok, ok let me tell you
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along
And it was all all right
Now it's all all wrong
That's just a-how
It goes when you're gone
You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
That storm is gonna come
Gonna wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah
There's no good reason why
We can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along
And it was all all right
Now it's all all wrong
That's just a-how
It goes when you're gone
Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then somthin' comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man
I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're gone
And it was all all right
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone
And it was all all right
Now it's all all wrong
And that's just a-how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When your long long gone
We were driving to Birmingham, Alabama and my buddy Keith was driving the truck
And this lady about ran us off the road in a cadillac.
She just kinda smiled when she went by, and he has road rage and he said look at that Big Fat Bitch
So I grabbed my little travel guitar out of the back and went
Big fat bitch
She's a big ol big ol fat bitch
She goes to Ryan's and they say, "Shit!
This one's gonna cost us...
She's a big ol bitch!"
She's a big ol bitch
She sweats grits
You can hide a pound of dope
Under one of her tits
Big fat bitch
She's a big ol bitch
Who stole Christmas?
The Grinch
Who stole the Twinkies?
Big fat bitch!
She's a big ol bitch
Yeah she had this cajun friend
Who had a pet alligator
She ate that some-bitch
Like it was a green Now N Later
Or a fried green da-mator
You'd have to have a turbo-foaming car wash brush
To masterbate her
She's a big ol bitch
She's a big ol bitch
When she was eight years old she had a Pogo stick that would say, "hey Wanda!"
And they'd go "song-tong-thong-song-tong-thong"
And now her pogo stick says, "HOLY FUCKING SHIT!"
And they go "Bount. Bount."
She's a big ol bitch
She's a big ol bitch
She gargles and drools and spits
And she makes all kinds of noise
She chases the ice cream man down Cunningham
In her corduroys
She's a big ol bitch
She's a big ol big fat bitch!
The devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind
And he was willing to make a deal
Well he come across a young man sawing on a fiddle and he played it hot
The devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said "boy, let me tell you what
In case you didn't know it, I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to make a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play pretty good fiddle, son but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you!
Well the boy said "my name's johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been!
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia
And the devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul
The devil opened up his case, and said, "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from his finger tips as he rosined up his bow
When he pulled that bow across the strings, it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in, it sounded just like this
When the devil finished, johnny said, "well you're pretty good old son
But just sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done"
He played fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house with the rising sun,
Chicken in the breadpan picking out dough,
Granny does your dog bite, "no, child, no"
The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at johnny's feet
And johnny said, "devil, come on back if you ever want to try again
But I told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been!"
He played fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house with the rising sun
Chicken in the breadpan picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite, "no, child, no"
Children of the beast embrace
To scorn and hate the human race
Consume the light that hugs the earth
And aid the womb in giving birth
To a group that will appear
And guide you through this final year
The dark armies then will come
When the Sum is 41
Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed 'em
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go
Looking back now on my life I can't say I regret it
And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it
But you only get once chance at life to leave your mark upon it
And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it
You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go
Like a sweet sunset in Georgia let it go
And like the fear that grabs ahold ya let it go
Let it go
Let it go
You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go
Gonna put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet, sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Come on in the water it's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know it's him
And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves
No matter anyway
'Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
'Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait till tomorrow
'Cause I ain't in no hurry today
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have 'em take their time
When they lay this sinner down
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
Gonna get right with the Lord
But there'll be hell to pay
But I ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry
Be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait till tomorrow
'Cause I ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today
I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd has come and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home
Every exit is a season,
Every signal is a beacon
And the wind, it carries me
And it eases up my load
Everyday I drag the turns
Every candle still burns
And every lesson I have learned
Brings us closer to the crowd
I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd is done and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home
Well the bus it is our steeple,
It brings us to the people
And they will be there waiting,
Dancing young and old
And every one of us gets tired,
But every one remains inspired
And every one of us require
To keep picking through our souls
I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd is done and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home
She says, "Daddy where do you go
When you leave me all these nights
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand?
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile,
Where do you go,
Daddy where do you go?"
I play the road,
And this highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords
Been helping us along when the story's told
And the crowd is done and gone
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home
Shaking off the miles
(Shaking off the miles)
(Mile after mile)
Mile after mile
Baby, I'm coming home
Fell to my knees with a knife in my back,
Never thought you'd be the kind to do something like that,
But you did
Cold hearted
You talked so sweet, and your smell it made me weak,
And I fell so fast that I never thought to ask
If you were
Cold hearted
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
I want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do
I don't think that I could be so
Cold hearted
Pretty little words covered your dark and crooked heart
With a forked tongue I fell in love,
Then I fell apart
You are so
Cold hearted
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
I want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do
I don't think that I could be so
Cold hearted
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do
I don't think that I could be so
Cold hearted
There's a note on the table.
Said I ain't coming back.
Till your sorry ass is gone.
I'm tired of the cheating and running around.
I never saw the wrong in anything you've done.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
There's got to be a bottle in the back.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
Got to get this devil off my back.
Well I stumble my way into my local bar.
Where I saw the devil in my glass.
The bartender told me it was time to go.
I told him that he could lick my sack.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
There's got to be a bottle in the back.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
Got to get this devil off my back.
Kentucky, Tennessee, you better find Whiskey.
Not leaving that's a fact.
Small batch sour mash.
Red nose, red face, gonna wreck the whole place.
Looking through the bare glass.
Bald head chapped ass gone...
It's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
Lord it's a hard thing to overcome to wake up and find the
Whiskey's gone.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
There's got to be a bottle in the back.
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.
Got to get this devil off my back.
I hear the waves
Sun beatin' down on my shoulders
It's a near-perfect day
Wishin' I wouldn't get any older
They say that it's gone 'fore you know it now
Quiet your mind
Soak it all in
It's a game you can't win
Enjoy the ride
I feel the change
Goin' on all around me
It's strange
How I'm taken and guided
Where I end up right I'm needed to be
Quiet your mind
Soak it all in
It's a game you can't win
Enjoy the ride
At the end of the water
A red sun is risin'
And the stars are all goin' away
And if you're too busy talkin'
You're not busy listenin'
To hear what the land has to say
Quiet your mind
I hear the waves
Sun beatin' down on my shoulders
It's a near-perfect day
Wishin' I wouldn't get any older
They say that it's gone 'fore you know it and
Soak it all in
It's a game you can't win
Enjoy the ride
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights shinin' through the windowpane
He said, "I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?"
She said, "You're a ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'"
At a truck stop diner just outside o' Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him
He said, "I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?"
She said, "You're a ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'"
Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby
Oh, I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
(I ain't ever gonna change)
I ain't ever gonna change
(Got a gypsy soul to blame)
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'
When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then
A man's blood runs hot
As high as the temple will go
Though we can deny our nature, baby
It makes us less in control
There's a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand
With secrets that she only knows
Oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes
And it's to her that I must go
'Cause she settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
C'mon
Oh it's not my style
To be afraid
Of what evil men gon' do
And I won't live in fear
I know why I'm here
Yeah, I'm sheltered and watched after too
'Cause these people put on the fine business suits
And they step on your face till they're going
Oh, the money, the cursin', when it's time for the hearse
Only bankers and lawyers are showin'
Come and settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Hey boys,
Listen right here.
This ain't ever gonna get on country radio
I'm tellin' ya'
You gotta change your style
C'mon
Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Settle me down
Settle me down
Oh won't you settle me down
The coolest fever in my blood
Oh won't you settle me down
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had I heard from across the room
If we were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
Wise man next to me did say
'Bout the one that got away
"Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance, go on, son
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith"
"Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away"
"You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith"
"Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day
Don't be falling, falling in, falling in love as she's walking away"
How come all the pretty girls like you are taken, baby?
I've been looking for someone like you to save me
Life's too easy to be so damn complicated
Take your time and I'll be waitin'
Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only
I think about you some days
And the way I would lay wastin' day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you, baby, the way I do
Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only
Well the world can be real tough
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself
Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only
Well, the world can be real tough
Won't you hold on to me
When there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
(Keep me in mind)
And I'll hold you darling
(Keep me in mind)
I'll be your man
(Keep me in mind)
I'll hold you darling
(Keep me in mind)
C'mon little mama
Put it on me
Hooooooooooa whoa whoa who knows
When I was a baby child
My daddy said to me
Many mountains we must climb
Before we'll be free
But he never told me
About the bruises on my knees
How they would be the map that leads him where we need to be
And oh that storm came down
Forty days, forty nights
Who knows
What the thunder and lightning will bring
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more
Who knows
Which way the wind is blowing
And when we look back on these things
We won't cry no more
Whoa whoa whoa who knows
Wandering blindly
Searching for the truth
And anchored to a solid rock
That we could hold on to
But there's no tomorrow
Not for everyone
Who will hear your last harsh words
When your time on earth is gone
Ooh that storm came down
Forty days, forty nights
Who knows
What the thunder and lightning will bring
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more
Who knows
Which way the wind is blowing
And when we look back on these things
We won't cry no more
Whoa tilt the lamp now
Don't let the wind blow it out
Oh guide the light child
Cause one day it's gonna shine
Sing up till the darkness it is lifted
Sing up till the darkness it is lifted
He was born in the woods
Torn from his home.
Well, he was naked,
And destined
To be out on his own.
And he waited in darkness,
Hoping someone might see,
From something so rough,
What a treasure he'd be.
Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me.
Well he's hollow in the middle
From the shape that he's in.
He's either filled up with music
Or locked in his shell again.
And it takes some fine tuning
To make him come around,
But he's a huge piece of me
And I'll never put him down.
Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me.
He is a good friend,
And he has his own voice.
And you get what you give;
Sometimes it's just noise.
But if you treat him well
He will last your life long.
And if you're honest and open
Well, he will write you a song.
(Write you a song, write you a song)
Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me.
"You got a quarter?"
I passed out last night and I never made it home
Wound up on a bus to San Antone
Now my head hurts bad and I ain't wearing shoes
Gonna find my wallet and my way back home to you
We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can go
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day
I got cuffs on my hands, chains on my feet
Got locked up for the second time this week
And I know I make you cry but girl my love is true
Gonna find my wallet and my way back home to you
We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can pass
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day
"Hey, baby...
Yeah, I know... I kinda got held up.
Yeah, I need you to come get me if you don't mind.
Yeah, they got me again.
Hello? Hello? HELLO!?
Oh, baby...
It's not my fault!"
Now I'm back on the street, thumb in the air
Don't know how the hell that I got here
But I'm gonna hitch that ride, if it's the last thing I do
Gonna find that wallet and bring it home to you
We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can pass
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day
We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
Oh now, don't you let this life come whip your...
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day
Hit me!
Yeah!
Here it comes, oh, yeah!
Zop-a-do-zit!
There's a long black train comin' down the line
Feedin' off the souls that are lost and cryin'
Rails of sin; only evil remains
Watch out, brother, for that long black train
Look to the heavens, you can look to the sky
You can find redemption starin' back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burnin' your ticket for that long black train
'Cause there's vict'ry in the Lord, I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
There's an engineer on that long black train
Makin' you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a-waitin' on your heart to say
"Let me ride on that long black train"
But you know there's vict'ry in the Lord, I say 
Vict'ry in the Lord 
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
Well, I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good, but I must stay away
That train is a beauty, making everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere
But you know there's vict'ry in the Lord, I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train 
I said, cling to the Father and his holy name
And don't go ridin' on that long black train
Yeah, watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a-drivin' that long black train
Some men dream of crossin' oceans
Some men dream one day to fly
Spend their whole lives out there floatin'
On the water and the sky
Some men dream of building fortunes
Some men dream of havin' fame
Nothin' else is more important
Than makin' money and a name
But In My Dreams I see
A little sky blue house
Beside a small stream
A front porch, a screen door
The sound of bare feet runnin' and cartoons
In My Dreams, your dreams come true
I come find you in your garden
Pullin' weeds between the rows
Trade a kiss for a glass of water
Sit and watch what love can grow
In My Dreams, your dreams
Are the only things
That really matter to me
When you smile, I smile
What makes you happy makes me happy too
In My Dreams, your dreams come true
In My Dreams, your dreams come true
I have been around
This old block before
I've walked into
Abruptly closin' doors
Schooled in hard knocks; I've learned a lot
'Bout how a heart can break
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
It ain't layin in the dark and wonderin' why she hasn't called
And now it's 2 AM
It ain't drivin' by her house to find her wrapped up in the arms
Of your ex-best friend
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
You say you could
Show me how to love
Baby there's one thing
You can be sure of
I wouldn't treat you wrong 'cause I've been on
The hurtin' side of pain
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
It ain't showin' up for dinner with a rose and Chardonnay
Then drinkin' by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii sayin' we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold faced lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
It ain't a mink coat,
Forty pairs of shoes,
Two 14-carat anklets on my Mastercard.
It ain't walkin' in a pawn shop,
Recognizing her engagement ring,
She swore she lost.
It ain't bold face lies or alibis,
That cannot be explained.
I might not know what love is,
But I know what it ain't.
If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
Yeah, I know what it ain't
I sure do like your Cadillac
Brings lots of Memories back
I always felt like a star
Drivin' around in that car
'Cause I had one one time
Oh I had one one time
You probably think I'm lyin'
But I had One one time
Have you got a job that you love
Each day you can't wait to get up
You feel proud when you draw your pay
Would you be surprised if I say
That I had one one time
Oh I had one one time
Now I hold a cardboard sign
But I had one one time
I bet you've got a good friend
You always hang out on weekends
Since high school you've been as thick as thieves
Well, I bet you'd never believe
I had one one time
Oh, I had one one time
Somewhere along the line
I had one one time
That beautiful girl beside you is probably your wife
Man, you've got it all, I'd say you live quite a life
I had one one time
Oh, I had one one time
Maybe I've lost my mind
But I had one one time
It wasn't even in my plan
A week in the sun and some fun in the sand
I was really only passing through
It all began on Ocean Drive
Standin' in line for a burger and fries
Coincidently, so were you
We took a quiet corner booth
Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville
I'm givin' up my walkin' shoes
While the wind and the waves wash away my blues
And you help me lose track of time
Rock and roll, your holdin' me
Rockin' in your arms by a rollin' sea
It was easy makin' up my mind
I can see forever in your eyes, your eyes
Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville
Didn't plan on hangin' out in Florida
Never was to good at standin still
Suddenly it's lookin' like I'm gonna
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville
Kill a few more days in Jacksonville
Woke up at 5 a.m., put on my camouflage
Wiped off my .243 and fired up my Dodge
Headed out to my ol' deerstand back in the pines
Gonna get me a ten point buck with 11 inch tines, yeah
Settled in Hidin' from the wind, waitin, on the sun
You might end up bein' my supper if you get in the way of my gun
It's so still I can hear the train from ten miles away
If I'm here eight hours from now it'll be okay, yeah
'Cause I'm a Backwoods Boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a Backwoods Boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
'Cause I'm a Backwoods Boy
I'm a Backwoods Boy
Sittin' on the bank of Lynches
River with a little campfire
Sleepin' on the ground, diggin' the
Sound of a backwoods chior
Talkin' to the man in the moon
Way up in the sky
He told me to let my worries
Roll on by, yeah
'Cause I'm a Backwoods Boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a Backwoods Boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
'Cause I'm a Backwoods Boy
I'm a Backwoods Boy
I'm a Backwoods Boy
I'm a Backwoods Boy
Mmm...
I'm a Backwoods Boy
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do
Can't bare the thought of
My life without you
Please baby, let's Unburn All Our Bridges
Whatever it was
That tore us apart
Can surely be healed
With forgiving hearts
Please baby, let's Unburn All Our Bridges.
Tempers were lost
Emotions ran high
Feelings were wounded
On the night of goodbye
We said some things 
We didn't mean
That wasn't you, baby
That wasn't me
I still love you
I will till I die
And love is much stronger
Than anger or pride
Please baby, let's Unburn All Our Bridges
Tempers were lost
Emotions ran high
Feelings were wounded
On the night of goodbye
We said some things 
We didn't mean
That wasn't you, baby
That wasn't me
That wasn't you, baby
That wasn't me
I still love you
I will till I die
And love is much stronger 
Than anger or pride
Please baby, let's Unburn All Our Bridges
Please baby, let's Unburn All Our Bridges
Unburn All Our Bridges
Unburn All Our Bridges
Uptown's got its hustlers
The Bowery's got its bums
And forty second street got big Jim Walker
He's a pool shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come
But he's stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim "boss"...just because
And they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well, outta south Alabama came a country boy
He said, " I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool shootin' boy
My name is Willie McCoy
But down home they call me slim
Yeah, I'm lookin' for the king of forty second street
He drivin' a drop top cadillac
And last week he took all my money
And it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back
And ev'rybody say
Jack, don't you know that
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well, a hush fell over the pool room
When Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloodyWas the soles f the big man's feet
Yeah, he was cut in 'bout a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor, uh huh
Now they say
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim
Now they say
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim
You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger
You don't mess around with Slim
If you got a little girl
You'd better take the time
To go to her tea parties
Give her a piggy-back ride
Be a dragon or a dinosaur
Every chance you get
'Cause one day you can bet...
She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
'Cause this precious little thing
That we call time
She'll go on you
If you got a special one
You'd better love her everyday
Leave her notes on the 'frigerator door
And send her sweet bouquets
Always be a confidant
A safe place for her to rest
Oh that little thing you call your happiness...
She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
Take her in your arms
And do her right
She'll go on you
If you got your mamma there
You outa thank her everyday
For nursing all your colds
And sitting up when you stay up late
All her hair is grey
And every year she's not as strong
One of these days
Before too long...
She'll go on you
Before you can turn around
And it's so lonely
Watching that fast train leaving town
You better cherish her
Every second of your life
'Cause before you get the chance
To say goodbye
She'll go on you
Yeah this precious little thing
That we call life
She'll go on you
...Yeah she will...
She was out last night till way past ten
Same thing all over again but with my best friend
Why'd she wanna make me so mad
I treat that woman good
Lord, I need a good woman bad
Now when I asked her to go to Sunday school
She went and called me a damned old fool
Now I don't understand
Why'd she wanna make me so sad
I treat that bad woman good
Lord I need a good woman bad
Here she comes
There she goes
Well I saved my money, and abought her a car
She got it stolen outside of the bar
She looks good, but she might not be
The kinda woman that I'm likely to need
Well, I don't know why I let her walk on me
She's impolite as she can be
Now I'm startin' to think
Hey, maybe I've been had
I treat that bad woman good
Lord, I need a good woman bad
(Repeat 3 times)
Yeah
(Bobby Braddock)
You talk about your feeling
Sometimes I keep mine to myself
But that doesn't mean your foolish
And you know I don't want anybody else
And you can say I love you
Like hello and goodbye.
Well I don't say it very often
But you know I'll love you till the day I die
That's just the difference
Between a woman and a man
Thank god for that difference
When we both understand
A woman and a man
I turn on like a light bulb
You warm up like an iron
And you might take a little longer
But your into it just as strong as I am
That's just the difference
Between a woman and a man
Thank god for that difference
When we both understand
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
Would you go with me 
If we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter 
As the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town 
And never shut it down
Would you go with me 
If we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer 
Until the trip was over
And would it be okay 
If I didn't know the way
If I gave you my hand, would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute 
Without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me
Would you go with me 
If we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free
Would you go with me
If I gave you my hand, would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute 
Without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me
Rains comin' down on the roof of my trailer house
With my luck I'd probably step outside and drown
How long will it take to get used to this doin' without
Guess I'll just lay around in my pajamas
Baby's gone home to mama
Baby's gone home, she left me alone
But she said she'd phone me sometime
Sad old song, left me long gone outta my mind
Well, we did our best but we didn't have enough in common
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama
Glance through the paper lookin' for somethin' to read
Even the funnies weren't that funny to me
It's written in the stars the future was plain to see, yeah
Might've known she'd leave if I'd read Nostradomas
Baby's gone home to mama
Baby's gone home, she left me alone
But she said she'd phone me sometime
Sad old song, left me long gone outta my mind
Well, we did our best but we didn't have enough in common
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama
Y'all, I miss her alot but at least she took the little Chiwawa
Sittin' here lonesome, baby's gone home to mama
Baby's long gone, baby's gone home to mama
She's gone
Ah, sittin' here in my pajamas
My pajammies
Darlin', it seems like the whole world's just turnin' so fast
Everything's changin' and we're just tryin' to keep up
But we've got something special here
Something worth waitin' for
Yeah, we're right on the edge of fallin'
Fallin' in love
No rush, no rush, ain't this world turnin', baby
Fast enough
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush
Walkin' (walkin') an' talkin' (talkin')
Dreamin' with you, wonderin' (wonderin')
And tell me baby, I've been wonderin'
Are you feelin' it too
No rush, no rush, we've got forever, baby
For catchin' up
Let's lay it on back to the speed of love
No rush
No rush, no rush, ain't this world turnin', baby
Fast enough
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush
No rush, no rush, we've got forever, baby
For catchin' up
Let's lay it on back to the speed of love
No rush
Let's slow it on down to just the two of us
No rush
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Let's go over
What I had in mind
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
Like any other would be country singin' sensation
I had no visible means of transportation
One Saturday mornin' I was searchin' the ads
When I found one that I wanted and I wanted it bad
(He found one that he wanted and he wanted it bad)
I called up the salesmen, he said, c'mon in
I've got the Lincoln right here belonged to Loretta Lynn
The Coalminer's Daughter used to drive it to town
It's yours for a song and five hundred down
(He said, it's yours for a song and five hundred down)
I said, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
I had no idea what that dealer was thinkin'
But he totted the note on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Well, I throwed my ol' guitar in that big back seat
And I steared her on out on to Dameron Street
Them other cars pulled over like the red sea had parted
It was then I had a vision of Dolly Parton
(Right there he had a vision of Dolly Parton)
She said, ain't that Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, it's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
She said, I thought I recognized them two headlights blinkin'
I do declare, that there's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Dolly said, slide over J Otis, let me take you downtown
Miss Loretta's waitin' for us at the Orchid Lounge
I couldn't believe my ears, I couldn't believe my eyes
Why she was wavin' from the curb and we drove by
Well, we turned that big rig around, right on a dime
I ain't seen nothin' like that since Red Solvine (Red Solvine)
That's what Loretta was sayin' as she hopped in the back
Then she said, hey, Hoss, ain't this my old Cadillac
No mame, Miss Loretta, this ain't your Cadillac
It's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln (Loretta)
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(It's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln)
The radio was on and we was all lipsinkin'
Ridin' 'round Nashville in Loretta Lynn's Lincoln, whooo
I heard a tappin' on the window as I woke up
Neath an old newspaper in my pickup truck
The policeman said, boy, you better hit the road jack
Get that bucket of bolts back across the tracks
Officer, this here's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(And he said) son, that ain't Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, I was wakin' up and my dreams were sinkin'
Like them ol' springs on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln (Loretta, Loretta)
Whooo, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(That is Loretta Lynn's Lincoln)
If you ever get to wonderin' what I was a-dreamin'
I was dreamin' I was ridin' in Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Grand Old Opry music show playin' on my radio
Fiddle and a steel guitar in some little redneck bar
Parkin' lot full of four wheel drives
You won't hear no hip hop jive
Cowgirls lookin' for cowboys
Two-step to that ol' white noise
I'm talkin' 'bout white noise comin' from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
When the evenin' sun goes down crusin' through our little town
Country girls and country boys showin' off hillbilly toys
Talkin' 'bout white noise comin' from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
Tractor pulls and rodeos, county fairs and bluegrass shows
It ain't a thing 'bout black and white
It's Johnny Cash and Charley Pride
It what I call white noise comin' from the real mccoys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the real mccoys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
And take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'
My chances weren't good she was way out of my reach
How could she ever fall for some ol' boy like me
But here she lies asleep tonight in these arms of mine
And that goes to show angels fall sometimes
She's been here long enough to see that I'm no saint by now
Every mornin' I wake surprised to find her still around
The love that she give to me could be no truer sign
Every now and then angels fall sometimes
She brings pieces of heaven every day into my life
She's been my inspiration with her by my side
I'm not afraid to dream high
The love that she gives to me could be no truer sign
Every now and then angels fall sometimes
Yeah, I thank the Lord angels fall sometimes
Well, I grew up wild and free
Walkin' these fields in my bare feet
There wasn't no place I couldn't go
With a .22 rifle and a fishin' pole
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know it's a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh, Lord, have mercy on a country boy
When I was young I remember well
I'd hunt the wild turkey and bobwhite quail 
The river was clear and deep back then
Had fishin' lines tied to the willow limb
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know it's a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh, Lord, have mercy on a country boy
Well, they damned the river, they damned the stream
They cut down the Cyprus and the Sweetgum trees
There's a laundromat and a barbershop
And now the whole meadow is a parking lot
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know it's a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh, Lord, have mercy on a country boy
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know it's a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh, Lord, have mercy on a country boy
Oh, Lord, have mercy on a country boy
There ain't nothing that can't be done
By me and God
Ain't nobody gonna come between me and God
One day we'll live together
Where the angels trod
Me and God
Early in the morning talking it over
Me and God
Late at night talking it over
Me and God
You could say we're like two peas in a pod
Me and God
He's my Father
He's my friend
The beginning
And the end
He rules the world
With a staff and the rod
We're a team
Me and God
I am weak and he is strong
Me and God
He forgives me when I'm wrong
Me and God
He's the one I lean on
When life gets hard
Me and God
He's my Father
He's my friend
The beginning
And the end
He rules the world
With a staff and the rod
We're a team
Me and God
He rules the world
With a staff and rod
We're a team
Me and God
We're a team
Me and God
I've got my share of scars on those ol' monkey bars
Every time I'd hit the ground
On that old long dirt my bike lost control
And once again I was fallin' down
Every time I'd try to fly, there's a force I can't deny
Gravity
Grew to be six foot one, depended on no one
Yeah, I was my ol' man
Invincible and strong until you came along
And touched me with your gentle hand
When I look into your eyes, there's a force I can't deny
Gravity
Well, I never really like it much
Always left me all scraped up
Never really saw it as a good thing
Changes tides out on the sea
Pulled your body close to me
First time I ain't been afraid to fall
Don't guess it's so bad after all
Gravity
Well, I never really like it much
Always left me all scraped up
Never really saw it as a good thing
Changes tides out on the sea
Pulled your body close to me
First time I ain't been afraid to fall
Don't guess it's so bad after all
Gravity
Gravity
Mmmmmm, gravity
I grew up workin' on a farm, way down South
I went to school against my will, way down South
I kissed girls and I shot squirrels out behind my house
I learned a lot about this world, way down South
I went to church, sang a lot of hymns, way down South
I learned to work on my pickup truck, way down South
I played my guitar under the stars, out behind our house
You will always find my heart, way down South
Clothes on a clothes line, hangin' in the sunshine
A garden growin' in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good ol' sound
People drivin' pass when I'm cuttin' grass
Wavin' at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South
Swimmin' in the creek with all my friends, way down South
Prayin' them days would never end, way down South
Give me a worm and a fishin' pole, I'll pull a fish on out
Those memories will never get old, way down South
Clothes on a clothes line, hangin' in the sunshine
A garden growin' in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good ol' sound
People drivin' pass when I'm cuttin' grass
Wavin' at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South, way down South
Yeah, way on down
I got a home down on the river
I'm married to the woman of my dreams
Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
Everything is perfect or so it seems
Momma and daddy come by sometimes
And everything is fine
My old dog does a little singing
Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
Let us go and see who's getting baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
Cause everything is fine
Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week we're gonna have a fish fry
Cause everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
Wahoo!
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
Yeah
When I look in her eyes
It ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flyin like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a pumpin
When we get to kissin', there ain't no stoppin'
When it comes to love
She ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker
When I light the fuse
I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun she fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a firecracker
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But Id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.
She goes off with a great big BANG
Boys I tell ya it's a beautiful thing
She takes off you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket
In the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a Heart attacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker
Chrous:
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
'Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But Id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.
We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
She's a firecracker
She's the light of my life.
Firecracker
Firecracker
WooHoooo
Firecracker
Firecracker
BANG
Firecracker
Firecracker
All the things I've felt and never shared.
All the times that she was lonely with me there.
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes.
And how I let her go without a fight.
The reasons I'm alone, I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forever in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life. 
If love ever gives me another try.
There's no changing things that we regret. 
The best that we can hope for is one more chance. 
If the hands of time could just move in reverse. 
I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her. 
The reasons I'm alone, I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forever in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life. 
If love ever gives me another try.	
Oh, the reasons I'm alone I know by heart. 
But I don't wanna spend forver in the dark. 
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life, 
If love ever gives me another try. 
Oh if love ever gives me another try.
There's so many things
That I need to do
Seems like nothing gets done
When I'm feelin' so blue
And it's so hard to handle this absolute truth
That you're so not around and I'm so into you
You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart
And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you
I keep ringin' and ringin' your old
Telephone seems like the
More that it rings
The more that you're gone
I oughta hang up and just let you go
But a voice in my heart
Keeps sayin' hello
You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart

And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you
I've been searchin and searchin but it
Just get's me down
Cause your love and affection is
Nowhere to be found
You're so not my baby
It's making me crazy
It's breakin my heart
And my world half in two
You're so not my baby
Hey I should be okay
But ya know what
I'm so not
Over you
Know what
I'm so not
Over you
So not my baby
So not my baby
Just about a mile off o' Thirty One
There's a whole lot o' nothin' gettin' done
Blue-collar rednecks feeling fine
A couple o' sips of a year old shine
Everyday's about feeling good
Way down yonder in the trailerhood
Danny Ray's fishin' in his one-man boat
If he stayed gone no one would know
Darlene's boyfriend came home drunk
Ol' boy's luggage is loaded in the truck
That's one less two-timer up to no good
Way down yonder in the trailerhood
The trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood
If you wanna see a mobile home
Get turned into a honky tonk
Turn your truck south off o' Thirty One
Where the backwoods boys git-er-done
It's a single wide party box back in the woods
Way down yonder in the trailerhood
Yeah, the trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood
I said, the trailerhood, the trailerhood
Ain't nobody doin' what they should
One thing is understood
You can be yourself in the trailerhood
Yeah, you can be yourself in the trailerhood
Every time you shake your hips
Baby, I go crazy
When you kiss me on my lips
Baby, I go crazy
When you call me on the phone
Your sexy talking turns me on
You make it tough just holding on
You got me going crazy
Baby, I go crazy
I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy
When you put on that party dress
Baby, I go crazy
You got me hooked, I must confess
You got me going crazy
Baby, I go crazy
I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy
Baby, I go crazy
I see it coming and I can't help myself
You give me loving like nobody else
You got me falling now, I'm calling for help
Girl, I'm going crazy
You really know how to drive me wild
Baby, I go crazy
Crawling 'round just like a child
Baby, I go crazy
Darlin', I go crazy
Baby, I go crazy
I used to think that I was living big
Bet my money on almost anything
Time and time, I got caught struggling
Oh, I had plans, I had dreams
And I had an open bar policy
Spending time tryin' to numb the pain
Lost my family just to gain a friend
Oh, strange faces I didn't need
I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
My folks used to tell me
Turner stop and think
Don't waste your whole life
Doing selfish things
Hurting your loved ones
Just to get yourself a stir
There comes a time when
You gotta let it be
I thank the Lord
He had his hands on me
Not really thinking
I had sunken deep
I looked all around
And I was standing all alone
I had dug my myself a hole
I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
And I looked around
And I was standing all alone
I had dug my myself a hole
I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
I'm on a highway
A lonesome byway
You know, I don't know where to start
With changes on my heart
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
Traveling goin' nowhere fast
Oh the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
It's better my darlin', I promise you this
Next time I hold you, I'm not letting go
Will you wait for it darlin'?, I need to know
Well you know I'm a sailor, and tomorrow we sail
It's hard way of livin', but I know it well
And if I surrender my life to the sea
You can marry another, and it's all right with me
Though we won't be together again till the spring
Just imagine the treasures I'll bring
Come lay with me, stay with me, soon I'll be gone
I will remember you all winter long

And when I return to the one that I miss
Oh the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
The sweeter the kiss
When the mornings are warm, and the valleys are green
I'll come back from wherever I've been
Oh the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
It's better my darlin', I promise you this
The next time I hold you, I'm not letting go
I will give up the ocean forever I know
Forever I know
Way beyond the city lights
Lots of cowboys, paradise
Honeysuckle on the vine
Growing up on southern time
Love to dance and we love to flirt
Ain't afraid of a little dirt
We ain't late for Sunday church
Mama raised us not to curse
Our short's a little shorter
'Cause the sun's a little hotter
Sipping lemonade
While we're playing in the water
Oh, oh oh oh, ain't nothing sweeter than us Georgia peaches
Oh, oh oh oh, there's a reason why the boys pick the Georgia peaches
We grow where the grass is green
We got home grown in our jeans
We love country everything
From Alan Jackson to Aldean
Well, I don't drive you crazy
When we wink and call you baby
You don't stand a chance
Once you've seen a southern lady
Oh, oh oh oh, ain't nothing sweeter than us Georgia peaches
Oh, oh oh oh, there's a reason why the boys pick the Georgia peaches
Oh, ain't nothing sweeter
It don't matter where you're from
Come on in and have some fun
We're gonna treat you like you're one of us, yeah
Oh, oh oh oh, ain't nothing sweeter than us Georgia peaches
Oh, oh oh oh, there's a reason why the boys pick
Oh, oh oh oh, ain't nothing sweeter than us Georgia peaches
Oh, oh oh oh, there's a reason why the boys pick
Ain't nothing sweeter, ain't nothing sweeter
Ain't nothing sweeter, Georgia peaches, Georgia peaches
Brother's in the backyard diggin' in the dirt
Mama's in the kitchen in an old t-shirt
Daddy's diesel's coming up the street
And she's in her bedroom growing her wings
Ready to Run in her headphones
Pretty in pink on all ten toes
Nose in a Cosmo magazine
All the junk mama says, she's too young to read
Little do they know she's growing her wings
They got her whole life on lockdown
Doing time behind her bedroom door
I guess it's all right for right now
But outside her window there's so much
More room for running and space to discover
A whole wide world to see
She's dreaming about the girl she's gonna be
Stuck in Ross County, growing her wings
The neighbor boy taught her how to French kiss
And daddy's got eyes in the back of his head
He said, no dating till you're 18
Now she's in her room grounded, growing her wings
They got her whole life on lockdown
Doing time behind her bedroom door
I guess it's all right for right now
But outside her window there's so much
More room for running and space to discover
A whole wide world to see
She's dreaming about the girl she's gonna be
Stuck in Ross County, growing her wings
She wants to fly and never look down
But tonight she's tucked inside a tiny little town
In a little twin bed all safe and sound
And there's so much
More room for running and space to discover
A whole wide world to see
She's dreaming about the girl that she's gonna be
Stuck in Ross County, growing her wings
Growing her wings
Picked a wildflower off the side of the road
You put it in my hair
Two bare feet up on the dashboard
Hands waving through the summer air
Looking at you, looking at me
With the wind strapped to our backs
Flying as high as a bird in the sky
Don't get much better than that
And we sang all the way down to Tupelo
Love struck right on the money
Heartbeats a beating to the radio
Kisses sweet as the honey
Down in Tupelo
All the way down to Tupelo
Counting the white lines a mile by mile
Worries slipping away
Took a back road for a little slow down
Off of the interstate
We followed the river as far as it goes
Smiling in the July sun
Hearing you say, you were falling in love
I said, you ain't the only one
And we sang all the way down to Tupelo
Love struck right on the money
Heartbeats a beating to the radio
Kisses sweet as the honey
Down in Tupelo
All the way down
La la la la la la
Wind strapped to our backs
La la la la la la
Don't get much better than that
And we sang all the way down to Tupelo
Love struck right on the money
Heartbeats a beating to the radio
Kisses sweet, kisses sweet
And we sang all the way down to Tupelo
Love struck right on the money
Heartbeats a beating to the radio
Kisses sweet as the honey
Down in Tupelo
All the way down to Tupelo
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
All the way down to Tupelo, yeah
All the way down to Tupelo
All the way down to Tupelo
I get this feeling every year, the first days of winter
Pull out that box of souvenirs, to read your old letters
In that stack of memories, found a note you left for me
It almost feels like you're still here
I hear your voice in every word
You told me to remember
Take each day and make it last
Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what's in the middle
Makes me smile when I look back to every summer
You forget your birthday and just laugh; say it's just a number
But Sunday afternoons, they meant so much to you
The simple things were golden, you found beauty in every moment
Take each day and make it last
Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what's in the middle
The day you're born is just a start
Your last breath is a question mark
The story of your life is in the in-between
Take each day and make it last
Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
Take each day and make it last
Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what's in the middle
What's in the middle
People always say I have a laugh
Like my mother does
Guess that makes sense
She taught me how to smile when things get rough
I've got her spirit
And she's always got my back
When I look at her
I think I wanna be just like that
When I love, I give it all I got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared, I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because, I see myself
Like my mother does
I never met a stranger,
I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly
But she can walk away, when she's had enough
She sees everybody, for who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She's helped me get this far
When I love, I give it all I got
Like my mother does
And when I'm scared, I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because, I see myself
Like my mother does
She's a rock
She is grace
She's an angel
She's my heart and soul
She does it all
When I love, I give it all I got
Like my mother does
And when I'm scared, I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because, I see myself
Like my mother does
I hear people saying
I'm starting to look
Like my mother does
She was the kind of girl that never quite fit in
Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin
Every time she saw those school doors open wide
She'd wanna turn around and run back home and hide
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Got used to being stuck at the back of the line
The kind that kept her head down most of the time
Secret dreams 'bout the boy in the high school band
And then wake up thinking she'd never had a chance
She's a wildflower
Just waitin' on a sunny day
Just waitin' on the winds of change to blow
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah
Trying to find the perfect place to grow
She's a wildflower
She's a wildflower
She makes a wish on every single star she sees
Yeah somewhere deep down she still believes
She prays every night before she goes to bed
Pretty soon her luck is gonna change
She just doesn't know it yet
She's a wildflower
Just waitin' on a sunny day
Just waitin' on the winds of change to blow
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah
Trying to find the perfect place to grow
She's a wildflower
She's a wildflower
She's a wildflower
Just waitin' on a sunny day
Just waitin' on the winds of change to blow
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah
Trying to find the perfect place
Yeah she's trying to find a place
She's a wildflower that's waiting on a sunny day
She's the secret that nobody knows
She's a wildflower, she's a wildflower, she's a wildflower
Oh yeah, boy 
You pull up in that jacked-up ride 
Open the door on the passenger side 
There's a lot of girls who might 
Wanna climb inside 
But I'm not one of them 
You start flashing that country boy grin 
And your big city money clip 
There's a lot of girls who'd love to go cashing in 
But I'm not one of them 
Baby, baby 
You're gonna have to do better than that 
If you want my love 
You gotta give me some back 
Give me something real 
Not another come on, baby, come on 
There's a lot of girls 
Who might just fall for what you got
But I'm not one of them 
Now some may get into your kind of thing 
That only you can make their little hearts sing 
Well, you can go on thinking what you want to think 
I'm not one of them
Baby, baby
You're gonna have to do better than that 
If you want my love 
You gotta give me some back 
Give me something real 
Not another come on, baby, come on 
There's a lot of girls 
Who might just fall for what you got
But I'm not one of them 
I'm not some notch 
On your Facebook wall 
And I'm not some last chance 
Midnight call 
Baby 
You're gonna have to do better than that 
If you want my love 
You gotta give me some back 
Give me something real 
Not another come on, baby, come on, yeah 
You're gonna have to do better than that 
If you want my love 
You gotta give me some back 
Give me something real 
Not another come on, baby, come on 
There's a lot of girls 
Who might just fall for what you got 
But I'm not one of them 
I'm not one of them
Back in '41 you met a brown eyed boy who called you pretty
He'd walk everyday a couple miles out of his way to hold your hand and keep you company
Your mama said don't call it love at 14
But sitting on that front porch swing
He gave you his picture in a locket that you wore around your neck 
Left it right beside your heart so you would not forget 
The way it felt when he held your hand
And you swore that you would never take it off
And the butterflies you felt said it all
You were falling with a boy inside your locket
Back in '43 your brown eyed boy went over seas and had to leave town for a little while
He swore he'd marry you as soon as the war was through, you would be his wife
Standing in the pouring rain
You cried as you watched him ride away
But everyday
You had his picture in a locket that you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart so you would not forget
The way his kiss tasted on your lips
And everyday felt like a lifetime with him gone
And you prayed that God would bring him safely home
'Cause you made a promise to the boy inside your locket
Oh, 60 years you two had together and he's been gone for a couple now
And it breaks my heart to see you struggle to remember
And I've been writing all your memories down 
And I stopped by today to read a couple pages
Grandma, you sure look pretty
And you smile that smile, the one I haven't seen in quite a while
And you said to me, I want you to keep 
His picture in a locket that I wore around my neck
The one I left beside my heart so I would not forget
The greatest love and the greatest man I've ever known
But it's getting time for me to head on home 
She said, that brown eyed boy is waiting and I don't wanna keep him long
Heaven is calling, and she said, my heart is longing
For the boy inside your locket
It's about fifteen hundred miles to California,
They'll get there Friday if they leave tonight,
She sneaks out at three thirty in the morning,
Leaves a note so she won't see her daddy cry.
He cuts the engine when he coasts in the driveway,
She slides in and gives him one kiss for the road,
No friends and no family, no job out there waiting,
The whole town will call them crazy but they gotta go.
'Cause when you're young and in love, yeah,
You might do some things that don't seem all that smart,
Cause there ain't no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart, yeah.
They can barely make rent on a rundown apartment,
She's waiting tables and he's a valet,
They're behind on the bills and the car's barely running,
But he buys a ring with the tips that he's saved.
When you're young and in love, yeah,
You might do some things that don't seem all that smart,
Cause there ain't no greater distance
Than the eighteen inches from your head to your heart.
Last thing they need is another mouth to feed, but they want one,
They're just kids themselves but that's gonna change in nine more months,
She wakes him up at three thirty in the morning,
Ready or not their new life's gonna start,
Seven pounds and eighteen inches,
The doctor lays that new baby's head right on her heart.
When you're young and in love, yeah,
You might do some things that don't seem all that smart,
But thank God for those eighteen inches,
The distance it is from your head to your heart, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gotta little picture painted in my mind
Of that special, not so perfect guy
My heart wants me to find
He ain't too pretty, he ain't to sweet
A little rough around the edges
Cute and country just like me
One of those t-shirt, blue jean wearin'
Mama lovin', fishin' pole carryin;
Swears a John Deere revvin' up
Is music instead of noise
Dirt road, 4-wheel drivin'
Riverside Saturday night and
Sunday mornin' church goin' kinda boys
He ain't gotta have money or a brand new truck
But he better shake my daddy's hand
When he comes to pick me up
Gotta be a little reckless, a whole lotta fun
And he's gotta know my midnight curfew
Don't mean 12:01
One of those t-shirt, blue jean wearin'
Mama lovin', fishin' pole carryin;
Swears a john deere revvin' up
Is music instead of noise
Dirt road, 4-wheel drivin'
Riverside Saturday night and
Sunday mornin' church goin' kinda boys
One of those cornfed, bonfires
Goin' down a hill in a tractor tire
Cow tippin', rope swingin'
Backwoods, front porch swingin' boys
Yeah
One of those t-shirt, blue jean wearin'
Mama lovin', fishin' pole carryin'
Swears a John Deere revvin' up
Is music instead of noise
Dirt road, 4-wheel drivin'
Riverside Saturday night and
Sunday mornin' church goin' kinda boys
Sunday mornin' church goin' kinda boys
Sunday mornin' church goin' kinda boys
Yeah
You used to want me
But I didn't want you
But now I want you
Oh, but you don't want me
Why can't our two hearts
Just make up their minds?
And want the same thing
At the same time
The funny thing about love
It never makes sense
It just keeps messing you up
It never makes sense, never makes sense
You let it go, never want it back
You turn around and just like that
You swear you can't get enough
That's the funny thing about love
That's the funny thing about love
We were best friends
Until I kissed you
You know you liked it
And I did too
As soon you admit you're crazy about me
I'm off and running, the soon enough you'll see
The funny thing about love
It never makes sense
It just keeps messing you up
It never makes sense, never makes sense
You let it go, never want it back
You turn around and just like that
You swear you can't get enough
That's the funny thing about love
That's the funny thing about love
It makes you crazy
It will make you do the stupidest stuff
You can't live without it yeah
That's the funny thing about love, yeah
The funny thing about love
It never makes sense
It just keeps messing you up
It never makes sense, never makes sense
You let it go, never want it back
You turn around and just like that
You swear you can't get enough
You swear you can't get enough
That's the funny thing about love
That's the funny thing about love
The funny thing about love
It never makes sense
It just keeps messing you up
Let the light shine on my mama
She's been worried about me
And I can tell she's tired
Walk my brother in a straight line
I know he's only 16
But he's been playing with fire
Give my grandpa a little peace and quiet
I can feel the years of hard work in his hands
Make my days pass just a little bit slower
I've been runnin' so fast
I've forgotten who I am
And so I go where the green grass grows
The weeds are high and the sun hangs low
Look to the sky and I say, hello
Like it's the very first time
It doesn't matter how long it's been
I can talk to God like he's my best friend
Take my heart lay it down again right there
In a dirt road prayer
He's a good guy
Looks dad in the eye
And I wonder if you made him just for me
But before I fall give me patience
Until you show me where to take this
And I go where the green grass grows
The weeds are high and the sun hangs low
Look to the sky and I say, hello
Like it's the very first time
It doesn't matter how long it's been
I can talk to God like he's my best friend
Take my heart lay it down again right there
In a dirt road prayer
It's good to know I can
Always go where the green grass grows
The weeds are high and the sun hangs low
Look to the sky and I say hello, ooh yeah
It doesn't matter how long it's been
I can talk to God like he's my best friend
Take my heart and lay it down again right there
In a dirt road prayer yeah, yeah
In a dirt road prayer yeah, yeah
Give me a bottle,
Of your very best,
'Cause I've got a problem
I'm gonna drink off my chest.
I'm gonna spend the night,
Gettin' down,
Cause that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
That woman that I had wrapped around my
Finger just a come unwound,
She kicked my out of the house and
Tonight I'm whiskey bound.
Well I'm gonna be,
The drunkest fool in town,
Cause that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
Well she packed my bags,
And opened up the door,
And I got a feelin' she didn't want me around no more.
She caught me in a lie,
When I was messin around,
And that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
That woman that I had wrapped around my
Finger just a come unwound,
She kicked my out of the house and
Tonight I'm whiskey bound.
Well I'm gonna be,
The drunkest fool in town,
Cause that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
Just a come unwound
And that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
Well, it won't be long now
Till that 'ol sun goes down
And darkness helps me hide my shameful tears.
My wife works all night long
For a man who's halfway gone
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.
It's a shame she wears the name
Of a man who's locked and chained
To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares.
To the men with hungry eyes
She works and hides her pride
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.
It's a shame she wears the name
Of a man who's locked and chained
To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares.
To the men with hungry eyes
She works and hides her pride
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.
In a bar in Acuna called Mah Crosby's
I found myself not feeling any pain
I told a Frisco girl I'd come for freedom
She said she'd only come to catch a train
We struck up some idle conversation
Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening
And I fell in love again for my last time
Blame it on Mexico
If You need a reason
Say it's too much guitar music, tequila, salt, and lime
Blame it on Mexico
But she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time
Daylight dawned and found me in DelRio
In a run down motel room as dark as hell
I felt all the pains of a morning after
And all alone as far as I could tell
Why she left, I have no way of knowing
Guess she cought her train, and that's a crime
She took everything I ever wanted
And I fell in love again for my last time
Blame it on Mexico
If you need a reason
Say it's too much guitar music, tequila, salt, and lime
Blame it on Mexico
But she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time
Lately you've been showin' all the signs
Of a woman with someone else on her mind
It's not your fault
Some nights I've left you alone
And if you're thinking, you want a stranger
There's one coming home
If you're thinking you want a stranger
I'll soon be there
You're gonna see a change in me
This time I swear
No more late nights
Comin' in at daylight
And no more doin' you wrong
And if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today
Picked up some roses
And champagne on the way
Oh I called to ask you
To put some soft music on
'Cause if you're thinking, you want a stranger
There's one coming home
If you're thinking you want a stranger
I'll soon be there
You're gonna see a change in me
This time I swear
No more late nights
Comin' in at daylight
And no more doin' you wrong
And if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one coming home
I don't get along
With people who aren't kind
I don't get along
With folks with only money on their mind
And I don't get along with someone
Who's always trying to tell me what to do
But on and on
I get along with you
Well, I don't like
People always telling me that I should change
They get simple lives
For them to think they've got my life to rearrange
But they don't understand
Exactly what love boils down to
'Cause on and on (On and on)
I get along with you
Well all it takes to please me
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side
And all I ever needed
Is knowing that I'm needed in your life
I may not do
All the things that other people want me to
But on and on (On and on)
I'll get along with you
Yeah, on and on (On and on)
I get along with you...
Well I'm out on a tear 'cause she's tearing me apart. 
If I look rough on the outside, you ought to see my heart. 
And this look in my eyes shows beyond a doubt 
That since my woman left I'm down and out. 
Well I'm down at the bar, out of my mind. 
Tighter than an eight-day clock with no way to unwind. 
(Well) that jukebox cries the blues like it knows what I'm about. 
Since my woman left I'm down and out. 
Well I'm down to my last dollar, but I don't really care. 
My friends have all got whiskey, and they don't mind if I share. 
They know how it feels to have your heart torn inside out. 
Since by woman left I'm down and out. 
Well I'm down at the bar, out of my mind. 
Tighter than an eight-day clock with no way to unwind. 
(Well) that jukebox cries the blues like it knows what I'm about. 
Since my woman left I'm down and out.
Since my woman left, since my woman left, 
Since my woman left I'm down and out.
I love the sound of a jukebox playing, 
So I sit here while she's staying home 
Watching Dallas on TV 
I love the taste of whiskey straight, 
But the strongest thing she ever takes is a sip
From a small glass of Chablis. 
Though birds of a different feather, 
Our love keeps us together, 
And she knows what's wrong with me tonight, 
I've got that Friday night fever; 
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever. 
She wouldn't change me if she could, 
So I wouldn't change her, she's too good. 
Sometimes a man just needs a change of pace. 
I've heard all those come-on lines, 
But I go home at closing time. 
I know no one could ever take her place 
Now she's taking down her hair, 
She knows I'll soon be there 
To give her the love she needs tonight. 
I've got that Friday night fever; 
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever.
I got that Friday night fever;
Sometimes a man just needs a breather. 
She knows I love her and I need her. 
And I'm no cheater, 
I've just got that Friday night fever...
I guess you think it's fun
To laugh at her expense
And point out each mistake she makes
I front of all your friends
You figure she'll let it go by
'Cause she loves you so
But, you know
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
She slips a little farther away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who knows what he's found
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
It's hard to bite my lip
But, I ain't saying a word
I give you all the rope to hang yourself
That you deserve
You might be ahead of me in her heart today
But, that's okay
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
She slips a little farther away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who knows what he's found
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
She slips a little farther away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who knows what he's found
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
She slips a little farther away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who knows what he's found
Every time you throw dirt on her
You loose a little ground
I let it all hang out last night
Come in hung over this morning
My woman met me at the door
Preaching me this warning
She said "You're gonna have to change
Your sinful way of living"
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
Well I promised to go to church with her
About a month of Sundays ago
And here it is, it's Sunday again
And I ain't been once in a row
And every time that old church bell rings
You can hear my rod and reel singing
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
'Cause there ain't no way
All my sins could be forgiven
There's only Ten Commandments
But I broke at least eleven
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
She went out and bought me
A Sunday go-meeting suit
And I must confess it looked pretty sharp
With my old hunting boots
But I wore holes in both the knees
Trying to roll them sevens
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven...
There's never been a man who could bring me down
I've walked away from the toughest of towns
But her last words tore me apart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her soft warm touch took me by surprise
I was blinded by the love in my eyes
The moment she left I felt the pain start
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Nickels and dimes
Memories and wine
She's on his mind once again
The same old stool
The same old fool
Played by the rules but didn't win
There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
He'd try forgettin' but he knows that it's no use
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more
She was his girl
His only world
That string of pearls that slipped away
A thousand dimes
A thousand times
He doesn't mind what they say
He fills the jukebox then plays the same old song
He fills his glass and then he turns her memory on
But it's a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more
There's a hundred dollar bill on the table
To get me through the night
Got a tight blue jean honky tonk queen
To hold me tight
And the cowboy bands in mission
Of Texas waltz 
It's music to my ears and a need to hear
To keep me from climbing the wall
'Cause tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy
Rip roaring wild, one more time 
Tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
Got all my friends around me
Telling the latest jokes
They can't see the joke's on me
I'm at the end of my rope
So I step out side and drink one
In the driving rain
That's all right if I'm high tonight
'Cause she's already drove me insane.
'Cause tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy
Rip roaring wild, one more time
Tonight I'll be, honky tonk crazy
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind
Oh, Let the whiskey whisk her out of my mind...
Some people say I'm one of those guys 
The blessings of life over looked.
Sometimes I feel like the tattered, torn pages 
Of some old paperback book.
All the places I've played and the money I made, 
I've still have nothin' to show.
And the only thing I have left 
In the whole wide world is you.
You put your whole life into something you love, 
But you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the backstreet bar 
And put you on center stage
But a million tears and million beers 
Have just about washed me up.
And the only thing I have left 
In the whole wide world is you.
I gave it all I had every night for all these years,
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone.
I spread myself so thin that I'm just barely hangin' on.
But tonight I'm with you, you can carry me through; 
Just l o v e me.
'Cause the only thing I have left 
In the whole wide world is you
I gave it all I had every night for all these years,
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone.
I spread myself so thin that I'm just barely hangin' on.
But tonight I'm with you, you can carry me through; 
Just l o v e me.
'Cause the only thing I have left 
In the whole wide world is you...
The band had just started when they walked in the door
He sat her at a table and strolled out on the floor
He grabbed the first sweet thang that gave him the eye
And left the door open for the steal of the night
Three dances later she was still in her chair
He was still on the dance floor like he didn't care
So I eased on over, there was no ring in sight
And I found myself facin' the steal of the night.
She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
Her long hair flowin' and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickin's were right
She was the steal of the night
We danced every slow one the band could play
Was it ever this easy for ole Jesse James
Had the gold in my hands and the banker was blind
Just inches away from the steal of the night
When the band stopped playin' we walked to the car
As I closed the door he ran out of the bar
Saw him shaking his fist under the parkin' lot light
As I strolled away with the steal of the night
She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
Her long hair flowin' and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickin's were right
She was the steal of the night
She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
Her long hair flowin' and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was...
Now I come and go as I please
From down here up North and in between
But baby it's a shame
'Cause I always feel the same when
I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try it makes me wanna die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm trying not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't say I don't like Tennessee
The people here have all been good to me
So please don't take offense
If I start to gettin' tense it's just cause
I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try it makes me wanna die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm trying not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try it makes me wanna die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm trying not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas
I can't see Texas
I can't see Texas from here
We said goodbye in Marina del Rey
I had a good time
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away
And on the plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday in Marina del Rey
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each others' eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina del Rey
Like the ocean tides, highs and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina del Rey
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed 
In Marina del Rey
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina del Rey
And as we looked into each others eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina del Rey
We said goodbye in Marina del Rey
There's a secret that I know 
About the lady that I love so
And I'm the only one 
She's shown her secret to
She's gentle and she's kind
She's proper and refined
But she lets down more than her hair
Alone in our room
'Cause, she's more than a lady
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes
She's more than a lady
And every night when we lay down
And she slips off her satin gown 
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
When shee go out somewhere
The men may stop and stare 
But they see she's a lady 
So they leave her alone
She's more than she seems
And in their wildest dreams 
They could never dream of 
What it's like to take her home
'Cause, she's more than a lady
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes
She's more than a lady
And every night when we lay down
And she slips off her satin gown 
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise
She's a lover in disguise...
Now, who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes or
The bitter direction of impending good-byes
I've followed and folded, I'm wilted in place
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face
With your heartbroke and runnin' from the reason
You got your heartbroke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin'?
With my heartbroke
Now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to you
But all is not lost, it's only mistaken
That's small consolation but I know just how you feel
With your heartbroke and runnin' from the reason
You got your heartbroke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin'?
With my heartbroke
Nobody said it was goin' to be easy
We all have feelin's that need a softer touch
But nobody said that it would not be worth it
The human condition continues as such
When you're heartbroke and runnin' from the reason
You've got your heartbroke, don't give up on believin'
When you're heartbroke, who kept me from leavin'?
With my heartbroke, you've got me heart broke
Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I got
Is just what I've got on
When that sun is high
In that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo, I'll be there
They took my saddle in Houston
Broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend
Somewhere along the way
But I'll be looking for eight
When they pull that gate
And I hope that
Judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's on my mind
Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I got
Is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime
But what I got is mine
I ain't rich
But Lord, I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
I'm finding out how hot an old flame can burn
You're a feeling I haven't forgot, the love I can't unlearn
You've become a memory I can't live without
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
 
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
Embers to ashes, that's how it should be
You'd think by now my heart would know
And it could set you free
The things I've tried, the tears I've cried
I guess there's no doubt
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
Oh how you sparkle
And oh how you shine
The flush on your cheeks
Is more than the wine
And he must do something
That I didn't do
Whatever he's doing
It looks good on you
You look so good in love,
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish you still wanted me
He must have stolen
The stars from the sky
And gave them to you
To wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder
Why I couldn't see
You look so good in love,
You want him
It's easy to see
You look so good in love
I wish you still wanted me
spoken:
Darling I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through,
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you awayplease let me say
You look so good in love,
You want him
Its easy to see
You look so good in Love,
I wish you still wanted me
Right or wrong, I'll always love you. 
Though you're gone, I can't forget. 
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming. 
Still, I wake with that same ol' regret. 
All along I knew I'd lose you, 
Though I prayed that you'd be true. 
In your heart please just remember 
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you. 
Right or wrong, I'll always love you. 
Though you're gone, I can't forget. 
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming. 
Still, I wake with that same ol' regret. 
All along I knew I'd lose you, 
Though I prayed that you'd be true. 
In your heart please just remember 
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you...
I used to like
Making love then 
Getting up
And never having to explain
I've always been free 
I never could see me
Dragin' no ball and chain
I like running around 
And being tied down
Never was my cup of tea
But since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me
And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking about future plans
And then I get the feeling that the life that I'd been leading ain't all it's cracked up to be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me
I used to like
To spend the night
Sittin' on an old bar stool
Drinkin' wine and killing time
With all of those other fools
But since you took my hand
I think I understand
It ain't the way it outta be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me
And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking about future plans
And then I get the feeling that the life that I'd been leading ain't all it's cracked up to be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me...
You ain't never fell as far as when you fall in love
Except the fall you take when you've been loved and given up
When you have your heart and soul rubbed into the dirt
An 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper will take away the hurt
Give me an 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free
It ain't easy losing love although it's turned out bad
All at once you're turning off old feelings you once had
But I found a helping hand right here in my hand
And 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper will help me take 'em out
Give me an 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An 80-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free
Every time my ship comes in
A hurricane blows it out again
Stormy weather seems to hang around my door
My sweet bird of paradise
Flew the coop on me last night
Oh, and every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
I got a letter from the I.R.S
They said, son, you're in a hell of a mess
Our computer shows you owe ten-thousand more
That machine's made a bad mistake
'Cause that's more than this poor boy makes
Oh, and every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
Every time it rains I just wash my car
The whole neighbourhood goes
Swimmin' in my front yard
Well, my mother-in-law says she's
Stayin' three weeks more
Oh, and every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
Just got my car out of the shop
Two blocks down the street it stopped
I went to use the telephone at the grocery store
I walked back to my Chevrolet
But they towed that sucker away
Oh, and every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
Every time it rains I just wash my car
The whole neighbourhood goes ]
Swimmin' in my front yard
Well, my mother-in-law says she's
Stayin' three weeks more
Oh, and every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
Well, every time it rains, Lord don't it pour
Sometimes I like a drink, 
'Cause I'm happy
When I think of how your love, 
Fits my life
If you see me light on my feet,
Feelin' good inside
Honey you're the cloud I'm on,
When I'm high
It's always been my style,
To celebrate
And what more could I celebrate,
Tonight
Your sweet love took my soul,
Flyin' to the sky
Honey you're the cloud I'm on,
When I'm high
When I'm high,
I'm high because you love me
No matter if I'm sober,
Or havin' bourbon with water by
If you see me light on my feet,
Feelin' good inside
Honey you're the cloud I'm on,
When I'm high
If you see me light on my feet,
Feelin' good inside
Honey you're the cloud I'm on,
When I'm high
Pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry it's just that I noticed you, goin' out of your mind
It look like we're two of a kind
Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms
Alone is much better together
When the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest of the tears that are left
From two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone
Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms
Let's fall to pieces together, right here, in each other's arms
You don't dress up in satin, 
You don't wear diamond rings, 
But I'm satisfied with you. 
You look just like an angel 
But you haven't got wings, 
But, I'm satisfied with you. 
I'd rather have you just the way that you are 
Than change you for somebody new. 
Maybe I could do better if I reach for the star, 
But, I'm satisfied with you. 
You're not made of candy 
But you're sweet as you can be, 
So I'm satisfied with you. 
I just can't see no reason 
Why you bother with me, 
But, I'm satisfied with you. 
I often wonder if it's all a mistake, 
It's hard to believe that it's true, 
But if I'm only dreaming, 
I sure don't want to wake 
'Cause, I'm satisfied with you. 
I'd rather have you just the way that you are 
Than change you for somebody new. 
Maybe I could do better if I reach for the star, 
But, I'm satisfied with you. 
But, I'm satisfied with you...
Lady, I know your out there, somewhere
Like me your feeling lost
Maybe right now we both need each other
But our paths may never cross.
People like us never find each other
Love is our greatest loss
Baby I know you are out there somewhere
But our paths may never cross.
We're to people that should be together
'Cause we're lonely at the very same time
But there's a million too many good reasons
Why your love can never be mine.
Maybe this song was written for you
Listen, don't turn it off
I wish you could learn it and come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross.
I wish you could learn it and come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross...
Fifteen years together
We climbed by work and will
From a simple two room cottage
To a mansion on the hill
Now, there's roses in the garden
But it's the coldest place in town
It took Fifteen years, goin' up
And one night comin' down
Fifteen years of heaven
For one short night of sin
From blue skies forever
To an end
From out on a mountain
To both knees on the ground
Fifteen years, goin' up
And one night comin' down
Her dreams have all been shattered
Her faith in me is gone
My tears tell her, I'm sorry
But they can't right my wrong
One night wrote my story
How a man can lose it all
After Fifteen years goin' up
It's hard to take a fall
Fifteen years of heaven
For one short night of sin
From blue skies forever
To an end
From high on a mountain
To both knees on the ground
Fifteen years, goin' up
And one night comin' down
I've been, fifteen years goin' up
And one night comin' down...
Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood, it fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away 
And you just can't get it back let's face it
For one split second she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said 
I see the way out and I'm gonna take it
I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
He stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it
'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
She kept driving along till the moon and the sun
Were floating side by side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
Eighteen years had come and gone 
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loadin' up that Chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Mama kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
Baby don't forget
Before you hit the highway you better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash
Here's a map and here's a Bible if you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep tellin' me I'm on my own
Just like every Sunday I called mama up last night
And even when it's not I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said 
Hey mama don't forget
To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall
Tell mee-maw that I miss her yeah I should give her a call
And make sure that you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl
Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me
Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
Haven't done this in a while so I don't know what to say
But Lord I feel so small sometimes in this big old place
Yeah I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
I've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
Always stumblin' around in circles
But I must have stumbled into something
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?
I wake up feeling like my life's worth living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all this love you're giving
Never knew never knew
It could be like this
But I guess
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky lucky sometimes
Now who'd have thought someone like you could love me?
You're the last thing my heart expected
Who'd have thought I'd ever find somebody?
Someone who someone who
Makes me feel like this
Well I guess
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes
Ooh
Even hearts like mine
Get lucky
Lucky sometimes
Even hearts like mine
Ooh
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes
Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky
Sometimes
Ooh
Sometimes
She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on"
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Sitting up on the roof sneaking a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon and the city lights
Takes off his flannel shirt drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight (and she says)
I don't want this night to end... why does it have to end
Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on
A tear falls off her cheek right when it hits his arm (he says)
C 'mon baby let's get out of here
They take one last drive round town man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel says "Life Ain't Fair"
This growing up stuff man I don't know... just don't wanna let you go
Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on
That's what my mama told me and just like those kids I didn't
I didn't wanna listen to no one
There's nothing you can do nothing you can say I know how it feels
When love goes away 
Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up
Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is, they don't have long
The night before life goes on
There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I could not undo
Some things I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
When life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 'cause it's gone
And you gotta just move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned
From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Lessons learned
Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Ohh...
I was sitting on my doorstep
Hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get on to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you're trying to fly
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
But getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bittersweet
Time heals the wounds you feel somehow
But right now
Lately, nothing I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier,
Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can't watch you walk away
Could I forget about the way it feels to touch you?
And all about the good times that we've been through?
Could I wake up without you everyday, would I let you walk away?
No I can't learn to live without
And I can't give up on us now.
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
A promise not to miss you
Now and try to hide the truth inside
I fail 'cause I just can't live a lie
Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy,
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe,
The way you know just what I mean,
No I can't learn to live without, oh,
So don't you give up on us now.
(Instrumental)
And I don't wanna try
When I try to hide the truth inside
I fail 'cause I just can't live a lie
I can't live a lie
I can't live a lie
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I 'm special
Cover me with sweetness
Cause the time will come when we're not so young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Livin' free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin' in our barefeet
'Cause when the summer's done
We might not be so young and beautiful
It's a crazy ride, baby you and I
Are keepin' our sweet love alive tonight
While we're young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
We'll party down on main street
Wearing next to nothin'
Feelin' every heartbeat
Having fun
While we're still young and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful
In the circles I've been runnin'
I've covered many miles
And if I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It wasn't nothing like I'd planned
And when I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
Close my eyes and see it
In a midnight talk
In a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we feel that rush
That's where it is... That's where it is
When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now
It's a lifetime filled
With tiny graces
The biggest things
In the smallest places
In the sweetest smile
On a night like this
In a tender touch
That's where it is
When we're tangled up
And can't resist
When we fill that rush
That's where it is... That's where it is
When you look back on times we had
I hope you smile
And know that through the good and through the bad
I was on your side
When nobody could hold us down
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
And no they won't forget, yeah
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
When you think back on all we've done
I hope you're proud
When you look back and see how far we've come
It was our time to shine
And nobody could hold us down
They thought they'd see us fall
But we, we stood so tall
And no we won't forget, yeah
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
You know that we, we showed them all
And no they won't forget, yeah
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stop light town
And back when I was really young
Part of that burned down
On any given Friday night
We'd drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the grocery store
Laughing all the while
With as many friends as I could pack
In my Daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore
My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house
I'd rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
Then hailing cabs here in New York
But I ain't in Checotah anymore
I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue sky
The Oklahoma kind
In a world of long red carpets
The bright lights of Hollywood
All the paparazzi flashing
Can make a girl feel pretty good
You can get anything you want here
Except a WalMart store
But I ain't in Checotah anymore
I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue sky
The Oklahoma kind
Where the Wildcats beat the Iron Heads
Old settler's day and the Okra fest
After prom down at the bowling lanes
Catching crappy fish in Eufaula Lake
I ain't in Checotah anymore
Oh yeah
I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind
But I ain't in Checotah
No I ain't in Checotah
Oh, there's nothing like Oklahoma
Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stop light town
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
(Take me to that place you cry from)
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh Lord, if I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet when I'm already on my knees
'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street, but boy, you can't bother me
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all rolls through
I ain't gonna raise my body 'til there ain't no sign
'Til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign of you
'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is 
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Oh, don't knock on my door
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage gets done
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed 
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, "Hey son, what's your problem? 
Tell me, have you lost your mind?" 
Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy, you better tell her goodbye!"
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American...
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?" 
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know... 
Sweet little beautiful, one just like you.
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American..."
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl 
Oh, American girl
Yeah, yeah
What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide 
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count, 'cause you can't get it back 
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else 
Seem so small, yeah yeah
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide 
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
She heard the trumpets from the military band 
And the flowers fell out of her hand
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
The preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang 
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
And then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him 
Oh and what could've been 
And then the guns rang one last shot 
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
Oh baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know,
Oh I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
Oh this is just a dream
This is just a dream
Yeah yeah
Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on, we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah we'll find a way to make the time pass
Window rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holding my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All of our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Yeah, let's just get out of this town
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
Hello you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom
There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
I stood at the bottom of some walls I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
Think that it's all gonna slip away
Hold on, hold on
Here's to you free souls, you firefly chasers
Street climbers, porch swingers, air guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers, shaking walls in your bedrooms
There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you, just like you
Yeah
I've met some go-getters
Some difference makers
Small town heroes and, big chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove
Oh, yeah
Here's to you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, and dashboard drummers
Here's to you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom
There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Yeah
I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately, you make me feel all I am is a backup plan
I'll say I'm done and then you smile at me and I'll forget
Everything I said...
I buy into those eyes and into your lies
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
Still no sound
Of footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
Last night I got served a little bit too much
Of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor 
And I let him call me baby
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
We left the club right around 3 o'clock 
In the morning
His Pinto sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!
Today, I woke up
Thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere
I gotta go 
Take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here
All of this will disappear
There's just one little problem:
I don't even know my last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh yeah
Did you check the tires, put gas in the car?
Don't think you'll need too much,
'Cause you ain't gonna get that far
Did you pack the good times?
Don't forget a map
Just incase the route you take isn't there to take you back
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost, and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this no you won't find this
There's once in a lifetime
And there's once in a while
And the difference between the two
Is about a million miles
Oh you might get lucky
While the moon is looking on
But in the truth of the morning
The stars will be long gone
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this no you won't find this
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost, and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is,
Oh in the end it's me you're gonna miss
'Cause you won't find this, oh you won't find this
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
This boy here wants to move too fast
He see's my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so
That boy there, well he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
We'll I don't think so
I don't think so
Cheap date, bad taste another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
And, I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog
Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so
Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games radier nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
And, I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog
Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me
Warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my
I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog
The more I love my dog
Baby you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I'd never need you, baby
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
If they don't feel you loving me
They all say that I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late now to save
I'm too tangled
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted
Maybe it's not right
But that's all right
Yeah, it's all right tonight
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted
Even it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit twisted
Yeah
It's twisted
Yeah
Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it will take us next
Babies are born and at the same time, 
Someone's taking their last breath
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down
It's the wheel of the world
I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on moving anyway
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
And around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You run and you try, and you're tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy
That's all I know
All I've done, all my life
'Cause throughout my history
I've only been with jerks
Who couldn't take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch with us two on it
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
You rescued me
Saved my life, just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try
'Cause, oh, the way you're kissing me makes it hard to breath
But I still like it
Oh, oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes
'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
And when I watch my baby grow up
I'll only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say
He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Well, I've been drawing little hearts in the morning paper
Lookin' for a house an' a couple of acres
You'll be mine some time, sooner or later and I can't wait.
Like a busy ol' bee savin' up it's honey
Honey I'm savin' up all my money
To have you I'll do anything I have to, 
Whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes to win your love
I'll hire me an airplane, 
Have it paint your name up in the sky above
I'll tell the world I'm yours, 
Put it on a billboard out on the interstate
If it takes forever to get us together
Honey, I'll do whatever it takes.
Well, I've been yellin' your name from a lookout mountain
Tossing my pennies in a downtown fountain
Makin' my wishes I'm hopin' they're countin' for loves sake
I'll swim upstream in a ragin' river
Walk through fire til you get the picture
I swear I'll bare anything to get there
Whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes to win your love first
I'll hire me an airplane, 
Have it paint your name up in the sky above
I'll tell the world I'm yours, 
Put it on a billboard out on the interstate
If it takes forever to get us together
Honey, I'll do whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes to win your love
I'll hire me an airplane, 
Have it paint your name up in the sky above
Yeah, I'll tell the world I'm yours, 
Put it on a billboard out on the interstate
If it takes forever to get us together
Honey, I'll do whatever it takes.
Well, if it takes forever to get us together
Honey, I'll do whatever it takes...
Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin'
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
Well, the clock on the wall says its midinght
And my baby still ain't home; where, oh, where can she be
Well, I got a sneakin' suspicion, she ain't all alone
What is this sound I hear a hauntin' me
Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin'
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
Well, she used to always be there whenever I would call
Waitin' for me paitiently
Now my fingers are calloused over from dialin' this old phone
I guess she's over getting over me
Somebody's callin'; callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin'
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
Instead of sittin' here a'bawlin', bawlin'
I ought to be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin' "darlin'" tonight
Saw a man in the movies, that didn't have a heart
How I wish, I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel, it breakin' all apart
And this emptiness inside, would suit me fine
It's times like these, I wish I were the tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted, and I would never even know
Well I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't need a soul
I couldn't see your leavin' comin', you took me by surprise
Even now, it still seems like a dream
But I know I can't be dreamin', 'cause as I lay down each night
The pain so great, that it won't let me sleep
It's times like these, I wish I were the tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted, and I'd never even know
I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't need a soul
Well I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't miss you so
(2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
Last night I think I put that home fire out
Came in late and lit to a cold dark house
I guess she thinks she got me good this time
She took all of hers, and most of mine
She left me high, but I ain't dry
Well I've got beer and tears to cry
Well I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
yeah that woman left me high, but I ain't dry
Say hey bar tender fill 'er up again
Lets us keep me in the shape I'm in
And if I can't get her memory to drown
Well I'll take it for a swim all over town
She left me high, but I ain't dry
Well I've got beer and tears to cry
Well I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah that woman left me high, but I ain't dry
Hell, I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah, that woman left me high, but I ain't dry
Well I finally found somebody
Who lives to give their love to me, only me
She takes away my worries
Shows me how true love's meant to be, what a relief
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string
Danglin' you around
Like you got no mind all
Love don't fade when the dog days come
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun
And I finally found somebody who
Lets that love light shine on through
Well I finally found somebody
Who welcomes me with open arms, into their heart
Thank God, my search is over
I found a four-leaf clover, love took me long enough
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string
Danglin' you around
Like you got no mind all
Love don't fade when the dog days come
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun
And I finally found somebody who
Lets that love light shine on through
Lets that love light shine on through
Well, I finally found somebody
Well, I finally found somebody
I finally found somebody
I finally found somebody
She'll call me honey, when she needs a helpin' hand
She might say darlin' if she needs someone who understands
She'll call me sugar, if she's feelin' kind of sweet
She'll say that I'm crazy over my little jealousy
When she calls me baby, I just reach for the light
And I'll hold her like a lady, thank God, she's all mine
With her arms around me, I can't leave the world behind
When she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind
When this life has brought me to my knees
She's got a way of bring out the man in me
When she calls me baby, I just reach for the light
And I'll hold her like a lady, thank God she's all mine
With her arms around me, I can't leave the world behind
When she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind
Oh, when she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind
Well I built a million ravin' beauties, out of pure make believe
Hopin' my imagination, might run away with me
Thought I'd picture every vision, that a man could dream about
Hell you walked through those swinging doors, and stepped down off that cloud
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Did you come here tonight, just to rescue me
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
Well I thought I died and went to heaven, when you sat down next to me
And I said to myself, this is too good to believe
You look like you belong, in a Sunday school choir
Instead of in this honky-tonk, settin' me on fire
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Darlin' did you come here tonight, just to rescue me
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
Are you just wishful thinkin', a figment of my mind
Well I'll worry 'bout that tomorrow, right now it's closin' time
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Darlin' did you come here tonight, just to rescue me
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
What's an angel like you, doin' in my wildest dreams
Now the Bible tells a story 'bout Adam's rib
How the Lord made a woman for companionship
Hell the first thing she did 
Was take a bite of the forbidden fruit
I guess we'll be paying 'til the end of time
At least that's how it is with that woman of mine
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Now this is wrong and baby that ain't right
I'm tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
This has gotta change or honey I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord,  I think I want my rib back
There's been a hole in my wallet and a pain in my side
Ever since I made that girl my blushin' bride
Her daddy calls her angel and her momma calls her three times a night
Her cousin's on my sofa, her sisters got my car
Her brother's drinkin' my liquor like my house was a bar
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Well now, this is wrong and baby that ain't right
I'm workin tryin to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
This has gotta change or honey I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Oh Lord I think I want my rib back
Well I was lost, in the wild side of life
I was blinded, by smoke and neon lights
Well I was drinkin', and sinkin', without a prayer
Then she showed, up right out of, thin air
She took me to heaven, oh my Lord, what a ride
And I've never been higher, on her love I could fly
I was hell bound, on my way down, then I found, what I need
Oh an angel, loved the devil out of me
I thank God, for her love, each day
He saved me, when he sent her my way
Now each night, I drive by, those neon lights
And go home to, my own paradise
Where she takes me to heaven, oh my Lord, what a ride
And I've never been higher, on her love I could fly
I was hell bound, on my way down, then I found, what I need
Oh an angel, loved the devil out of me
Oh yes she did
Yeah an angel, loved the devil out of me
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Do you believe in love at first sight
I don't think that I did, not until tonight
When I saw you dancin' on that hard wood floor
Kickin' your heels up, I knew it was love forever more
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
You're probably thinkin' I'm some kind of fool
Well, your right darlin', I'm a fool for you
You buy this line babe, I'll buy you a ring
Get on my knees and beg you, please, to marry me
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever want to change
But, honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Yes honey, I'd sure love to change your name
A Little country church on a two lane road
The bride and the groom comin' out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you wanna fall
That just makes me wanna give you my heart
Every forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you wanna fall in love
Old folks sittin' in a front porch swing
Still holdin' hands like they were 16
Fifty good years they're a lovers dream
Darlin' that could be you and me
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you wanna fall
That just makes me wanna give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you wanna fall in love
Yeah Yeah
Now don't that make you want to fall in love
If you don't get in the water, you're never gonna learn to swim
He said a snake is just as scared of you, as you are of him
He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite
Seems there was nothing that he didn't know
And as a kid I believed, 'cause grandpa told me so
He talked daddy into letting me have my first car
I thought I was really something till Becky Thompson broke my heart
That first taste of love nearly did me in
Getting over her was slow
And I knew someday I would, 'cause grandpa told me so
He said life was made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
And I lived by those words, 'cause grandpa told me so
I promised him I wouldn't cry when it was his time to leave
That's the only promise I made him I couldn't keep
He smiled from his bed and said we'll meet again
Somewhere down the road
And I believed, 'cause grandpa told me so
He said life was made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
And I lived by those words, 'cause grandpa told me so
He said life was made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
And I lived by those words, 'cause grandpa told me so
Yeah and I still believe, 'cause grandpa told me so
Grandpa told me so
I still believe
Grandpa told me so
I still believe
Yeah and I still believe
Her long legs looked like trouble
As she sashayed through the door
And my mind flashed a warning sign
That I chose to ignore
For the prize I thought that I could win
The risk seemed mighty small
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
I fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
Under all that beauty
Beat a heart that was made of ice
God knows as far as I could see she didn't have a flaw
But the bigger the fool the harder the fall
I said a woman to keep
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end
Well, one lesson I've learned that applies to all
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
One day she was lovin' me
The next day she was gone
And I became another verse
To a lonesome heartbreak song
Now that I've learned to face the truth
The words stick in my craw
Well, the bigger the fool the harder the fall
I said a woman to keep
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end
Well, one lesson I've learned that applies to all
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
With a little luck, this old truck, will get me home today
With a little more, I'll still have this job tomorrow
Weather man says, wet weekend, well he just might be right
But rain or shine, you'll be mine tonight
'Cause that's all I need to know
In a world where most things, come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know
Heaven knows, I ain't even close, to being God's gift to women
But in your arms, I feel like I am
I don't know it all, well I sure can't solve, the problems of the human race
But I know how to bring a smile, to your face
That's all I need to know
In a world where most things, come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know
Darlin', say it one more time
You will, forever be mine
That's all I need to know
In a world where most things, come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know
If I quit my job for the simple life
Honey, would you stand by me
If I bought a little cabin on a mountainside
Honey, would you stand by me
Would you be my one true friend
Stick with me through thick and thin
If the roof was old and the rain came in
Honey, would you stand by me
If I tried my luck in Hollywood
Honey, would you stand by me
If my break never came like I thought it would
Honey, would you stand by me
Would you be my heart of gold
And never complain when the money was low
If your coat was thin and your shoes were old
Honey, would you stand by me
And if I joined up with the rodeo
Honey, would you stand by me
If we traveled around from show to show
Honey, would you stand by me
Would you be a cowboy's dream
And smile right on when times got lean
If you didn't have nothin' but boots and jeans
Honey, would you stand by me
Honey, would you stand
Honey, would you stand by me
Honey, would you stand
Honey, would you stand by me
Honey, would you stand
Honey, would you stand by me
Well, I got a little girl and she's got a daddy
Who's got a lotta money and it makes me happy
To follow them around like a little whipped puppy dog
Well, she's my honey but he's my sugar dad
This country boy ain't doin' too bad
Livin' high on someone else's hog
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat
Bump on a golden log
Well, I traded that rusty ol' GMC
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
Well, this redneck boy from a blue-collar town
Has really moved up since he got tied down
I got a brand new life and I owe it to my daddy-in-law
Well, he gave me a so-called executive position
Now I get up early every day and go fishin'
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat
Bump on a golden log
Well, I traded that rusty ol' GMC
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat
Bump on a golden log
Well, I traded that rusty ol' GMC
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
Well, I traded that rusty ol' GMC
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny, we were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene, from a movie screen
Where every dream come true
Suited perfectly, for eternity
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way, I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Everyday I live, try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above, that we share this love
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Ordinary no, really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last, get as lucky as
Me and you
Their shadows danced closer, on the honky-tonk walls
As the band plays the last verse, to that goin' home waltz
And they'll start to peril, 'neath the parking lot moon
And some cars and a pickup, won't be picked up till noon
Somewhere between midnight and daylight
It's an after hours merry-go-round
Somewhere between midnight and daylight
There's a whole lot, of love lost and found
I wish I could say now, that I've learned it all
From my observations, as a fly on the wall
But if lonesome's a crime oh, I'm guilty as sin
'Cause tomorrow I'll pickup, my ol' pickup again
Somewhere between midnight and daylight
It's an after hours merry-go-round
Somewhere between midnight and daylight
There's a whole lot, of love lost and found
There's a whole lot, of love lost and found
I may not have a whole lot of money
But I got enough girl for you and me
I'm takin' off won't you come with me honey
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee
I wanna show you the Riviera
Got good tires and a good CB
Put on some lipstick your mascara
'Cause we're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee
Baby, I adore you
And don't say, I've never done nothin' for you
Girl, that just ain't true
Here we go
Baby, I adore you
And don't say, I've never done nothin' for you
Girl, that just ain't true
We might not see no Eiffel Tower
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet
He can pick the wild-wood flower
Better'n anybody down in Paris, Tennessee
We're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee
Ooooh, la-la, baby
Vous le vous
Barbecue
Saw a man in the movies, that didn't have a heart
How I wish, I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel, it breakin' all apart
And this emptiness inside, would suit me fine
It's times like these, I wish I were the tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted, and I would never even know
Well I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't need a soul
I couldn't see your leavin' comin', you took me by surprise
Even now, it still seems like a dream
But I know I can't be dreamin', 'cause as I lay down each night
The pain so great, that it won't let me sleep
It's times like these, I wish I were the tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted, and I'd never even know
I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't need a soul
Well I'd give anything, just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart, and I wouldn't miss you so
People always say that hindsight's 20/20
When it comes to mistakes in love girl I got plenty
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch cryin'
Living for the day I could make it all up to you
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome till then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Well I'm getting to know this old town like never before
Walking every street, knocking on every door
Girl, where ever you are, I want you back
I love you baby, and I'm sure 'bout that
Whatever it takes, there's nothing that I won't do
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome till then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
I must have been a fool, I confess
To ever let you go, now I ain't gonna rest
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome till then
Now honey I wont' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
I will always remember
The first time that we met
And the first time that I kissed your lips
Is a thing I won't forget
The special way you held me
Is the way you hold me still
And I knew right then that you loved me
And I know you always will
Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love
My grandma and my grandpa
My momma and my dad
Didn't have a lot of things
But love is what they had
Their love kept them together
Through the many years
Though life was hard
They shared it all
Through the laughter and the tears
Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's supposed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love
Baby you're the sunshine
That brightens up my day
And I will always stand by you
Darlin' come what may
And I will always love you
To have and to hold
And I'll keep my every promise to you
With this band of gold
Ain't that love
Ain't that how it's supposed to be
When two hearts come together as one
Just like you and me
Ain't that love
Shining in your eyes
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love
Heaven sent from up above
Ain't that love
There's so many things, I didn't say
And even though, it may be too late
I want you to know, I still love you so
Every car I meet, looks like your car
Every movie I see, you play the leading part
You're on my mind, can't leave you behind
When I close my eyes, you're all I see
In the dark of night, you're in my dreams
Throughout the day, you're easy to find
You're always there, when I close my eyes
In my mind I know, you're far away
But here in my heart, nothing has changed
I'm still holdin' you, like I used to
On a busy street, in a crowded room
Wherever I go, it's just me and you
Together again, girl it never ends
When I close my eyes, you're all I see
In the dark of night, you're in my dreams
Throughout the day, you're easy to find
You're always there, when I close my eyes
You're always there, when I close my eyes
In the town where I was raised
The clock ticks and the cattle graze
Time passed with amazing grace
Back where I come from
You could lie on a riverbank
Or paint your name on a water tank
Or miscount all the beers you drank
Back where I come from
Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from
We learned in Sunday school
Who made the sun shine through
I know who made the moonshine too
Back where I come from
Blue eyes on a Saturday night
Tan legs in the broad daylight
TVs, they were black and white
Back where I come from
Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from
Some say it's a backward place
Narrow minds on the narrow way
But I make it a point to say
That's where I come from
That's where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from
Back where I come from
I'm an old Tennessean
(I'm proud) I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from
(That's where I come from)
(That's where I come from)
(That's where I come from)
There's a fork in the road on my way home
Temptation waits, wine women and song
Lord, my will breaks where that road bends
And tonight I took a turn for the worse again
Left was home and right was wrong
And you can bet by now she knows which road I'm on
It's a road I know like the back of my hand
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again
My old truck pulls a little to the right
Seems to get a lot worse on Friday night
Things are bad at home, Lord, I'm sick of work
So tonight I took a turn for the worse
Left was home and right was wrong
And you can bet by now she knows which road I'm on
It's a road I know like the back of my hand
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again
Lord, tonight I took a turn for the worse again
Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny, we were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene, from a movie screen
Where every dream come true
Suited perfectly, for eternity
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way, I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Everyday I live, try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above, that we share this love
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Ordinary no, really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last, get as lucky as
Me and you
Well, I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I got an aching
Way deep down inside
And I need someone
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter anymore
We can turn the key
And lock the world
Outside the door
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light 
And love me tonight
Well, don't you worry
We're all alone now
So let your hair down
Come sit by my side
And turn off the TV
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter anymore
We can turn the key
And lock the world
Outside the door
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Gonna cash my check before the drive-thru closes
Get my baby a couple Quick-Sak roses
Put $5 dollars worth of gas in my pride and joy
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
Gonna take her out to the Tasty-Freeze then
We'll go dancing at the American Legion
When ole Bobby does Elvis
You swear it was the real McCoy
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
Aw, there ain't much to do in the one-light town
But we don't let that slow us down
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week
My pretty little girl is ready for me
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
When we've had enough of that shakin' and a shoutin'
We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains
Have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
Aw, there ain't much to do in the one-light town
But we don't let that slow us down
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week
My pretty little girl is ready for me
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
In a little town down south 
There's little plow-board house
With a wolf outside the door
And in the bedroom there's a light 
It's been staying on all night
For at least a month or more 
The heartaches and the bills keep coming due
And with all they're going through
It's no small miracle, that love hangs on
Hearts get weary, when hope is gone
In a world where roses, wither and die
It's no small miracle, when love survives
It's been uphill for a while
But he still makes her smile
Every now and then
Lately they been finding out 
It's the little things that count
And they do what they can
He tells her he loves her everyday
She says things will be ok
It's no small miracle, that love hangs on
Hearts get weary, when hope is gone
In a world where roses, wither and die
It's no small miracle, when love survives
In a world where roses, wither and die
It's no small miracle, when love survives
I've been a fool for love ever since 
I was a baby just a rockin' in the cradle
As a rule I was the kind who 
Laid his feelings right down on the table
Gave my world so many times 
Just to see them tear it apart
Whoa, Lord, have a little bit of pity 
On my poor old heart
I wonder just how many times a broken heart can mend
Oh, when I get back on my feet Lord, I always fall again
Rubies, furs, lies, goodbyes they've all left some scars
Whoa, Lord, have a little bit of pity on my poor old heart
Well, I ought to know by now 
After of these dead and heartache lessons
I can go without going through hell 
Trying to find a little heaven
Seems to me every woman I meet 
Has leaving down to an art
Oh Lord, have a little bit of pity 
On my poor old heart
I wonder just how many times a broken heart can mend
Oh, when I get back on my feet Lord, I always fall again
Rubies, furs, lies, goodbyes they've all left some scars
Whoa, Lord, have a little bit of pity on my poor old heart
Well, I said rubies, furs, lies, goodbyes 
They've all left some scars
Whoa, Lord, have a little bit of pity 
On my poor old heart
I said Lord, have a little bit of pity 
On my poor old heart
I believe that gas is too damn high
An' there ain't nothin' more American
Than Mama's apple pie
I believe in love; I believe in peace
But I don't believe we'll ever see it
In that Middle East
I believe the Bible is cold, hard fact
An' I believe that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does
I believe the Sabbath is a day of rest
The taxman an' the Devil share the same address
I believe don't start if you're gonna quit
I believe in keep your mouth shut
An' carry a big stick
I believe that dogs are better than cats
An' I believe that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does
There's absolutely, positively 
No doubt in my mind
That OJ did it; Lee Harvey didn't
An' she's really gone this time
I believe that cold, cold beer
Tastes better on a bar stool
Than it does anywhere
I believe hard work really makes the man
But everyone should wet a line every now an' then
I believe it's best to pay in cash
An' I believe that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does
There's absolutely, positively 
No doubt in my mind
That OJ did it; Lee Harvey didn't
An' she's really gone this time
I believe she was a real good thing
Can you believe I let a girl like her get away?
I believe she meant it the night she packed
An' said Jesus is comin' back before she does
Before she does
I was fifteen when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard when my face turned green
He said "You come from a long line of sinners like me"
Now me and my brother go to see him some times
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D.
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
And she had two more just like him
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me
Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own
And when the doctor smacks him, he'll probably take a swing
'Cause he'll come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
On the day I die
I know where I'm gonna go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates till his face I see
And stand in a long line of sinners like me
I'll stand in a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me
I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes,
Or rings in my nose to be cool.
The scars on my knuckles,
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots.
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I ain't got no blue-blood trust fund,
I can dip in to.
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn,
About the man who's collar's blue.
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?
I still say: "Yes, Ma'am" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye,
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth.
I cover my heart with my hat,
When they fly that Red, White and Blue,
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me:
Well, how 'bout you?
I like my country rockin':
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man,
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose.
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud,
We'll raise the roof.
Yeah, I might just stay all night long.
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
'Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
Spoken:
One, two, three
These boots have counted off many a band
Playin' one night roadhouse stands
For tips an' empty rooms
These boots have stood toe-to-toe
With the biggest, baddest Joes
Like they had some things to prove
These boots
Yeah, these boots, more than once saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
An' these boots have danced with the devil
An' nearly lost that battle
To Wild Irish Rose
I wore out more soles than I'd care to count
An' done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damndest thing I've ever seen 'em do
Is walkin' out on you
These boots had to see California
And an Arizona mornin'
Where God paints the sky
An' these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
'Cause that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes
I wore out more soles than I'd care to count
I've done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damndest thing I've ever seen 'em do
Is walkin' out on you
Now these boots are one step from the door
They walked out of years before
I can almost see her now
These boots oughta kick that door aside
Stomp out my foolish pride
But they just turned an' ran
Damn these boots
Damn these boots
These boots
It was my senior year; I just turned eighteen
I was a Friday night hero with division one dreams
I had an offer on the table, a four year ride
'Til that fourth and two and twenty four dive
I left on a stretcher, wound up on a crutch
Walked on that next summer; wound up gettin' cut
I flipped off that coach, left that school in the dust
For lettin' my dreams go bust
But I thank God I ain't what I almost was
Yea, I moved on back home, an' came awful close
To bein' some son-in-law to some CEO
Coulda been a corner office, country club, suit and tie man
Answerin' to no one but 'er and him
I ran out on his money, ran out on her love
At four in the mornin', I loaded my truck
I left my home town in a big cloud of dust
I just had to follow my gut
And I thank God I ain't what I almost was
In guitar town, I bought this old Epiphone
Started stringin' chords and words into songs
I've been puttin' in time on Sixteenth Avenue
Pourin' out my heart for tips on a stool
I ain't makin' a killing, but then there's those nights
When the song comes together and hits 'em just right
The crowds on their feet 'cause they can't get enough
Of this music I make and I love
And I thank God I ain't, yeah, I thank God I ain't
Man, I thank God I ain't what I almost was
Only fools would race down Grist Mill Road
Let alone in angry weather
That what I tell everyone I know
Now that I know better
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Without havin' to watch my Mustang burn
Before my best buddy had to wind up hurt
An' his whole life changed
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way
Only a fool would keep a diamond ring
In a box on the top of his closet
He came so close; he almost asked
It was right there in his pocket
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before standin' in the back row of that church
Watchin' her daddy givin' her
To the man who took my place
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way
Regret's been know to give a man a beatin'
But I ain't in the mood for fightin' back this evenin'
Only fools don't take the time of day
They stay too busy runnin'
An' to stop just once to tell their Dad
Just how much they love him
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before that phone call came an' it was her
No, Momma never had to say a word
I knew it was too late
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
I wear a greasy ball cap
I like my shirt untucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight
But I ain't scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me
Guys like me drink to many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me
Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college 
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why
Guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me
Now there's a lot of guys like me out there 
In a lot of little towns
And tellin' all our buddies, we won't ever settle down
We say that's just the way we are and the way we'll always be
So God sends girls like you for guys like me
Thank God there's girls like you, for guys like me
These four walls of Fort Worth
Are closin' in on me
My final meter's over
An' their gonna set me free
I can feel the fire's a burnin'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jailhouse floor
Lord, now I'm singin': "Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgement day
Every life owes a debt
That's what the Bible says
I owe mine to this state
For shootin' that boy to death
A liquor store at ten
He was reachin' for his gun
Well, now his Momma sits there smilin'
As the boss yells: "Roll on one"
And now I'm singin': "Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place
A hungry blue eyed baby cryin'
Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dyin'
I dropped my pistol on the floor
Yeah, I'd take it all back but there's nothin' I can do
They've covered my face
An' the order's gone through
As the boss yells: "Roll on two"
Now I'm flyin'
Up an' out of here
I close my eyes an' slowly rise
Let my body leave this chair
Lord I hope you forgivie me
For livin' my life this way
Yeah, tonight I ride the lighning
To my final restin' place

These four walls of Fort Worth
Are closin' in on me
Never realized how much she brought to the table
Till I went to sit my coffee cup where the table use to be
No cats, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle
An' no more hope for one day startin' that family
Bet she's gainin' fast on Memphis with a trailer-load in tow
Who says you can't take it with you when you go
'Cause she got away with everything that I had goin'
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all right
An' I got away with leavin' what needs said unspoken
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah, she took her heart an' took off down the road
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go
Good news is: ain't much here left for packin'
Bad news is: she left behind a million memories
All the echoes of her cryin', lovin' an' laughin'
Left me with nothin' left to do but leave
That ol' house is in the rear view: ridin' shotgun is her ghost
Who says you can't take it with you when you go
(Instrument Break)
Closin' in on Dallas, now, is the best love I've ever known
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go
There's a little dive on a dead-end road
Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Waterin' Hole
Where you can hear the sound of a steel guitar
An' get loud an' rowdy on PBR
But at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop
As ol' Jack drops in a quarter an' plays Merle on the jukebox, an' we stop
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But we're still wavin' that flag around here
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag
When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear
There's a high spot fifteen miles from here
Where you can always find a few dusty trucks
With the windows down an' the radio up
We sit there poppin' tops, shootin' bull an' singin' songs
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on 
We tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But we're still wavin' that flag around here
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag
One of these days when my time has come
You can take me back to where I'm from
Put me on a westbound train
An' ship me off in the pourin' rain
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
Just put a quarter in the jukebox an' sing me back home 
An' tip your hats
An' raise your glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But just keep wavin' that flag around here
An' I know, it'll keep on comin' back
Long as people pledge allegiance
Where folks still pledge allegiance
I pledge allegiance to the Hag
She was pacing back and forth on her front porch
I pulled up slinging gravel in my Daddy's Ford
She cried all the way to Johnson's store
I kept the motor running and parked by the door
Yeah I was foolish and wild
She was classic and regal
We were fresh out of school, both barely legal
We were young and on fire and just couldn't wait
Six weeks in, she was three weeks late
One means none and we're home free
Two means three and a diamond ring
Yeah I wonder what fate is gonna decide
We're just sittin' around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Yeah her Daddy's gonna kill me and that's a fact
Maybe we'll just leave town and never come back
Or I could stand there and tell him
Face him like a man
Oh who am I kidding, he'll never understand
Yeah that's second hand just keeps slowing down
I swear it stopped twice the last time around
Yeah we'll know the truth in three minutes time
We're just sittin' around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Hot summer nights, whispering her name
Under the blanket by the river bank
Hearts beating fast we never thought twice
But she pulled me close and I held on tight
When the moment of truth finally comes
She gives me a look and then comes undone
She says looks like were lucky
Someone's smiling down
She grabs her coat and says see ya around
Yeah these days the rabbit doesn't die
You just sit around waiting on two pink lines
Praying that fate is on your side
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
Sitting around waiting on two pink lines
(Yeah,
One, two,; yeah, one, two, three)
I woke up early this mornin'
An' I'm already runnin' late
There's a list of things on as my arm
I wanna get done today
Is it Tuesday? Is it Wednesday?
They're runnin' into each other
Somebody tell me, when is my day
Man, this life is sure bein' a mother
So tomorrow I'm takin' me fishin'
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I've gone missin'
An' I won't be back for a while
I'm so tired of only wishin'
I could leave my troubles behind
I wanna be front porch rockin'
With a big sun droppin' in a blue sky
Kick back an' get high
On the livin' part of life
(Yeah, c'mon)
They say to keep your spot on the ladder
An' keep that money rollin' in
They say keepin' up with the feelies, boy
You can't back off one inch
But I been puttin' in my time
An' I've built up a pretty good deal
I'm gonna spend more, maybe waste some
Before my time comes an' I wind up dead
