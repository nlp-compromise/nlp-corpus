One, two, three
Uh and here we go
Sending this message into space with my ray gun
Hoping that important ears will hear this when the days done
So far it's been great fun
You would swear I've been playing with myself
'Cause I been doing me since day one
They used to swear that I would never have a smash hit
Now I see them haters double-take no ad-libs
'Cause what comes from his lips is crack, Chapstick
What I'm composing, I'm singing, mixing, and writing bars
So I guess I make it easy to pick out my flaws
'Cause when one things crazy another's sub-par
So I guess I gotta make it work tr-tr-triple times as hard
The engineers will have my head is the mix is off
Rappers will be coming at my neck if the 16 is wrong
Singers keep telling me that I got a couple vocals flaws
But every single one of them is like "Yo! Your talents raw"
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
A... yeah first time listening to me
If you just popped a mixtape in or something
This is what I do, I make feel good music
I guess don't expect anything more or less
I just make whatever I feel like making
So please don't try and save me
This is how my story ends
This keeps me from going crazy
So I'll be writing till my death
I'm on my 3AM flow and I'm chilling with these lights low
This tracks too sexy I might just call a friend and see where the night goes
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
But yeah, like I said
The label is Beautiful Mind
My name is Jon Bellion and the mixtape is Scattered Thoughts Volume 1
Welcome, hope you like it. Word!
Yo, this beat is tough
I mean I made it but this beat is tough
I can say that

So basically you're like the only person
Who's not impressed by any of this and I love that
Work-a-holic, I'm a bad one
Sitting in front of this computer
Couldn't move me with a handgun
Us musicians are a sad bunch
Half the time I can't remember if I had lunch
(But she knows my heart she knows my heart)
She knows my heart (my heart)
She knows my heart (my heart...)
She knows, knows my, knows my
I understood when you were mad at me
When I was late to the Cheesecake Factory
I came an hour late but you fled the scene
Spanish waiter said "she peace'd around 9:15
Before anybody's trunk knocked
I was a skinny little Italian
With nothing but a jump shot
And if I ever got a hot head
She would call up Judy Bellion
In a hot sec, you bet
She's like a song so eclectic
And her eyes are like a string section
And her legs are like a electric guitar
And I'm Hendrix
I'm tempted to shred along her frets kid
You get it?
Like shred along her frets
Like a guitar reference 'cause her legs...
Like I'm basically explaining this right now
She's not even gonna be able to follow what's going on
And I think, like I said before
That's what I like most about her
What's wrong with me?
She sees past everything
No smoke, no mirrors
To see me clearer
I think about wedding rings
Let me slow down (oh no)
Let me slow down (oh no)
And if she ever left this home
I'd have trouble breathing on my own
Now I feel like you need to know
You gave wings, gave wings to my soul
Thank you Dilla for your swing and pocket
And ridiculous you did, that inspired me
And The Roots, you guys go without say
But she knows my heart...
My heart...
My heart...

She's a lady when she shakes hands in the streets
But she's an animal once we're up in the sheets
And I never win in Mario Kart 'cause she always cheats
Oh but that is okay because she's D.O.P.E
I have two parking tickets, she has forty-three
And all my friends they love her, she drinks more than me
And she really doesn't give a damn if I sing out of key
So baby what it look like, you're so D.O.P.E
Uh and she's the definition of my everything
I want to tell her so many things
Kick back, now I'm thinking about a wedding ring
She so dope, she so crazy
She's all mine so don't try to play me
'Cause your hands have a hold on me
'Cause you're so D.O.P.E. (D.O.P.E., D.O.P.E)
I-I-I was trying to stick so close to the plan
Couldn't find my heart than it rose from the sand
So I propose a toast East Coast to Japan
Give you a massage for your soul in my hands
So much in common
She is mos def the stars to my comet
She so new age and far from the logic
That I can't find love and have it for eternity
Pick it up now
She could rock the hippy look she so outta sight
I'm just glad I made the cut, I'm so samurai
Everything is cool with her, she don't need no candlelight
Dinner, she's a winner, we can kick it, chill at T.G.I
Fridays have a 2-for-1 but usually turns into 5
Who the hell is driving home, guess we got a taxi ride
Knock me out with a kiss like a jab
'Cause it punch-drunk love in the back of the cab
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great
She so dope, she so crazy
She's all mine so don't try to play me
'Cause your hands have a hold on me
'Cause you're so D.O.P.E. (D.O.P.E., D.O.P.E)
D.O.P.E, D.O.P.E
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great
D.O.P.E, D.O.P.E
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great

Baby let me know how it goes
When you go back to Heaven for the day
And baby let me know how it goes
When you're loving him, but you should be loving me
And baby let me know how it goes
When you realize you and him were never meant to be
And baby let me know how it goes
When you realize, oh when you realize
You should've been loving me

Beautiful Mind, Mind (Beautiful Mind, Mind)
Mind, Mind, yeah
(Trying to find my) Trying to find my soul
Trying to find my (Yo I hate being) soul
(Haha, I'm sorry)
Samira Gibson, trying to find my (Trying to find my) soul
(Trying to find my)
Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back
Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back
I said "I'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back"
Some where along this road, may have lost my way
But baby I'm ready to step again
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back"
I look right and I might just give you
Something to talk about, baby you better tell a friend
I'm just trying to get my soul back
I'm just trying to get my soul back
See it don't matter what you say to me
You're making music for my soul
For my soul, for my soul
Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back
My soul is a slick opportunist used in lyrics
Here's a meal for your thoughts, food filled with spirit
Never been affected by dudes who couldn't feel it
When I'm buried in the seam, I choose to Kill Bill it
I make music for my own uses
Never worry about approval from so called cool kids
Used to reduce thoughts of who I influenced
Now I'm all about a target, hitting hearts like Cupid
I from the land of break-beats and skate decks
Baselines and backpacks, good tape and tape decks
Making music from the heart
Trying to separate the real from the fake
But was standing in the dark
They used to tell me where the honey's at
During their recording and I bought it
Now I'm trying to get my money back
I can't say when me and soul departed
But I'm just trying to get back to where it started
Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back

You know uh the world is a dangerous place baby and
And I think you just kick and stay in for the day
Yeah, you can stay with me. I mean, you know
Whatever happens, happens
You know it's dangerous out there, ya know?
Let me talk to you
With so much wrong in the world
I'm just glad I found you
I'm just glad I found you
So many guns shot for no reason
I'm just glad I found you
I'm just glad I found you
Oh
So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives
So I have an idea
We should make love, we should make love
Till the world comes back around
Till the world comes back around
We should make love, love, love, love, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Till the world comes back around
Come on baby. You know, you know it sounds good
So let me, let me explain it to you
I'm just trying to lay low, she'll see where the day goes
Stay home, I will give you loving by the case loads
Stay up in the shade, you'll get burned by the sun's rays
Don't go for a run cutie, I can make your pulse raise
Risky situations for the birds, they can have 'em
'Cause the only one I'm inviting, my friend Sam Adams
And eleven of his friends, make a twelve pack slap'em
On the couch, we can sip'em till it's safe outside
Instead of watching the economy slide
I'm just trying to see my fingertips glide
Across your body, that's the safest flight I'm gonna fly
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
'Cause I'm a sure shot
Leave it if the door knocks
'Cause these sheets and these pillows and blankets be like Fort Knox
We can jam on the bed to we switch and let the floor rock
So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives
So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives
So I have an idea
We should make love, we should make love
Till the world comes back around
Till the world comes back around
We should make love, love, love, love, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Till the world comes back around
See I'll even do a piano solo for you
Yeah! Woo!
Ewa-ewa-e, ass stay home, ewa, off day
So is that a yes or a no? Hehehehe

Dope little boy, uh
Dope little boy
1, 2, 3
Stay steady rockin'
Feel good flow with a half-pipe Jones
Baby watch me drop in
I think the key is to never feel locked in
Just as long as you comfy in the pocket
Kids explore options
Don't listen to the outside world, it's obnoxious
They will try to cut your balls with no topspin (get it?)
Mentally and physically, you need to stay clocked in
Dope little boy, boy
Don't believe any of their lies
Dope little boy, boy
They can barely sleep with themselves at night
Dope little boy, boy
Never ever will they break your flow
Dope little boy, boy
Just keep doing things from your soul
(Yeah, yeah. This feels crazy)
I ain't on the guest list, 'cause I ain't a big deal
Mouth so Fresh Prince 'cause I gotta a stronger will
Smith and Wesson, keep bangin' on them, let 'em feel
Everything you do and spread love till the grinned' real
Why, Look a live little boy? 'Cause you're up next
Now that I'm making it, these girls are sending dumb text
I won't change if ten-thousand and change
Scream my name at a show like I had a lot of rough sex
Please excuse the nerdiness, I'm flirting with a lot of styles
Exploring lanes so insane, at a hundred miles
I'm just a kid, scruffy hair, with a goofy smile
But I had developed tough skin, no crocodiles
In the process of dream chasing
I will make what I feel like making
Hip Hop to Pop is two languages
But I'm somewhere in the middle, so Spanglish
And if you're not putting out a good vibe
Stay the hell home 'cause we're trying to have good time
They say he's gotta climb, but he's been fine
'Cause he feels good music in the air, wind chimes
Just know that my patience wearing thin
'Cause from cockiness to retardation is thin line
Just know that I'm in it for the win
'Cause I'm pushing real hard like I been ventured incline
Dilla and The Roots are stupid for this bassline
Two thumbs up. Woo! Great time
(Yo!)

Okay so I wrote this song drunk
And I'm recording this song drunk
So this is for her
I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh
Haven't seen you since last December
You're even prettier than I remember
Oh, you're like a breath of fresh air I would take in
Is it weird I wish you were naked
Oh, you love my jokes
I said "oh, you always loved my jokes"
I said "oh"
So if I went to kiss you
Would you kiss me back
Said "oh,"
I know it's been a while but I hope so
I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh
Unh, since when did you grow up, Hello Kitty always
Was on your bags and your socks, and cooties was always
My fear, now you're all Sex and The City on me
So grown, so mature, and so able bodied
To pay yo taxes, take it back to class
When I didn't have no Chapstick, I was so average
You were so bright-eyed and still believed in magic
We were so natural, but now we're so plastic
When did we grow up
Let's smash the clock and slow up
But if I have to hear one more thing about your business career
I might just throw up
But you showed up
Which so proved the old you's in there somewhere
So moved, the old school, into an only past
But let's open a new book as we go pass
I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh

(Rock it, rock it!)
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da
Da, da, dada-dum-da, da
Oh, I took all your records
Then smashed them on the floor
Then I came up with this melody
Till this baseline shook my floor
And after all the pain you've cause me
I see one things true, true...
Oh this song
Sounds like me getting over you
Now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
Her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
This is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
And goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit
Oh, I took all your records
Then smashed them on the floor
Then I came up with this melody
Till this baseline shook my floor
And after all the pain you've cause me
I see one things true, true...
Oh this song
Sounds like me getting over you
(Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful Mind)
Go head an tantrum, throw your fits (da, da, da, da)
I've built my bridge up over this (da, da, da, da)
Like Jersey Shore, I'm sure I've missed
'Cause I'm turning heart-breaking to hits
Hit the reset button on the play back
I'm just amazed that, you can erase that
ASAP out of your mind, it's like Ajax
'Cause you wipe me clean baby, eight stacks
Couldn't pay for this lesson learned
When I hit the dance floor baby, heads will turn
'Cause I'm looking good, turn to my bottle and kissed it
'Cause a drink looks a lot better than your lipstick
Now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
Her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
This is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
And goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

Everybody's mad, extra, all the time
I think we need more tracks like this
This is "Something2Relax2"
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Indian style on top of a waterfall flow
Had my whole life in front of me, watched it all go
Smoothly on top of the charts
Was me all up in my drop
But then my dream level popped
It seems life is always different when we open our eyes
This song goes out to anybody trying to get by
But it's constantly low, so you gotta stay high
If this could help you with your issues, then I need you to vibe
I don't really care for the tough guy image
I'm pretty sure a mother, who is spent but has given
Everything to her children, three jobs just for living
Doesn't really give a - if I get mad women
Skaters to the gangsters, punks to the preps
Everybody's got issues and for that I'll rep
Don't usually spit but this is something I'll rap to
Ego at the door and this is something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)
Whoa-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-ooh-oh

Said "Oh, it's the night before the mixtape drops"
And I'm just trying to rest my head
It's the night before the mixtape drops
And a bunch of dark thoughts fall in my head
What if it's not everything I want it to be
What if it sounds real good to me
But it doesn't sound good to him or her or anyone, oh, oh
Then it hits me that I really don't mind
But I'd be lying if I said that "I didn't think twice"
And I'ma say something I know I'll regret
But here it goes
We all just want to be loved
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved
And everything I do, I swear I'm self-conscious
Ridiculous, this is nonsense
And just admitting this, I'm getting kind nauseous
But I am not afraid, I am not afraid...
I am not afraid to admit I just want to be loved
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved
I write how I feel and I will spit accordingly
Half of y'all are boring me
My tanks filled with thoughts that I ought to get rid of
So I'll pass B, please don't gas me
And I'm just trying to see progress
But y'all don't want to see change
'Cause y'all be non-sense, get it?
Well maybe you do or maybe you don't like the song
So from the start I've been a fool
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved
The label's Beautiful Mind
Make a difference with the music that you make
My name's Jonathan Bellion and that was Scattered Thoughts Volume 1

22, and confused
On what to do and how to set it up
Kinda drunk, sort of high
She's a broken miss America
Never learned how to love 'cause the answers are stuck
Behind closed doors
You can call it a night when the lights in the club don't shine no more

Dum, dum-dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Beautiful, Mind, Mind, Mind
She's literally like 5 feet away from me
While I'm recording this, sleeping on the couch
This is for her, sleepy ass
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
You're behind me on the couch and in the studio
So I'm gonna make this all about sleep
And soft so I don't wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you dig it
Only I can make some soft shit and rip it
I knew you were dope from the jump like ribbit
'Cause all these other girls fall short like midgets
The Sandman gonna flip when he come through
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
Your hair is all over the place and I love it
I won't put the bass in this beat
If it knocks I might wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you like it
She just let me work 'cause she know I cook diamonds
She know I'm paid but she still 9-5ing
That's why she allowed to hang while I'm writing
Hahaha
The Sandman gonna flip when he come through
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
Dopest musical breakdown ever, ready?
If I make this
And maybe you will wake up and naked
Girl I'm playing, girl I'm playing, girl I'm playing
Maybe not
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum-dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Uh, look who finally decided to wake up?

Oh oh oh oh la da da da da da
Oh oh oh oh la da da da da da
Oh oh oh oh la da da da da da
Oh oh oh oh
See it went from talking shit loud
To graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures with the hipsters
And since I produced the record
Please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing on your sister (ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarettes, and leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me
I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars
Then taking shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me
You're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic
Hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spaz out
To sounds John Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spaz out
To sounds John Lennon would be proud-
Oh as I take off on an airplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yeah I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Oh oh oh oh la da da da da da
Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is keys without the locksmith
A new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit
You're hopeless, 'cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits
Work all day and laid back collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient, I've been chasing
Mister Myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mic's
My entourage is a bunch of guys
Who walk around mauling all the moms in every mall
With that sharpened claws
Not talking Santa or a certain type of grammar
I'm a standout
Not handing handouts to all your open paws
So put the hate down watch me spaz out
To sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spaz out
Yo sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud-
Oh as I take off on an airplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yeah I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)

You know, maybe I'm drunk
Maybe I'm not
Maybe this happened, maybe this didn't
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
Beautiful family friend is she
Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah...
And she's been living up in Albany
Then I had two shows I played up state
She came to show love and see my face
Then we got drinks and we chilled like "hey"
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"
Now she's like "Damn!
How did we let this happen, damn!
How did we end up in this bed then?"
I said "relax" and laughed like
"This would be a pretty dope song."
She's like "no, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song."
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that I'm going
It's over, My life is dead ass over
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets
The funny thing about this entire thing
You know like doing the one-take, write it quick, fun jokes?
But my sister won't hear this until I release the album
She'll hear every other song except this one
So surprise

It's so empty right where your head sleeps
And she said I still smell your cologne in my bed sheets
So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
When did love letters get lost in translation? (translation, translation)
I heard you took the train from Penn station (Penn station, Penn station)
So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
I have to tape my mouth
I want to ask you questions
Like do you sleep alone
I heard there's friends you rest with
So I text her friend
Like tell me where this man's at
She says you got some balls
You don't deserve to ask that
Oh no they gotta be lying
I'm dying to know
But I know you're not mine
So I can't say shit
So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

All that ass it was so first class
She was my co-pilot with a mile high swag
We would smoke all night just flyin' high like that.
Smoke smoke all night just flyin' high like, high like
I needed her, I know she needed me
If we fly this thing it's gonna take two people
But the storm came fast
Got a little rocky, the oxygen mask from the ceiling they were dropping
We started to fall right out the sky
Without a warning call. Nah-hoo...
We started to fall, no parachute so we had no time to call, for mayday mayday...
We bought two tickets and and a paradise,
One last flight trying make it right
But that's when the rain came,
That's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it far.
We bought two tickets and a paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane.
I know we tried to fly away, but we were just a
Paper plane.
It's funny how things end up
It's funny how we break it off
Relationships they nose dive,
While ones career is taking off.
Publishing checks and fake smiles as I see my dad,
My pockets getting filled
But really emptiness is all I have.
We crash, and now there's spare parts.
Bandages, and bad scars.
We try to mend broke Amelia Earharts.
And keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on.
But I'm missing my right wing
My right arm, and that's you.
We started to fall right out the sky
Without a warning call. Nah-hoo...
We started to fall, no parachute so we had no time to call, for mayday mayday...
We bought two tickets and and a paradise,
One last flight trying make it right
But that's when the rain came,
That's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it far.
We bought two tickets and a paradise
One last flight trying make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane.
I know we tried to fly away, but we were just a
Paper plane.

Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless
I'm not afraid to be a leader (gonna be)
To be remembered by the readers (gonna be)
My generation's Mona Lisa (gonna be)
Whoa-ooh-whoa yeah (no, no, you're gonna be)
I'm not afraid to be a hero (gonna be)
To be known wherever we go (gonna be)
I was told I was a zero (gonna be)
But no, no, no, no, no (You know you're gonna be)
And I can't sit and wait for all my plans
God didn't make this man
To be stuck in the middle of nowhere land
So watch me, set this moment on fire (you know you're gonna be)
Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless
This that feeling that you get from all these knock outs
My sister said "don't release it if you're not down"
So don't worry about the records that I swap out
I'm reaching for that Goosebump shit from College Dropout
Never let opinions split me in two
I keep smiling and do what I do
How he so quiet but that dope shine through
Because it's humbling when you're message is bigger than you
Yah! I grew up in a internet age
With 10, 000 freaking records on my internet page
It's kinda thought to not blend all the records I played
I'm just the one that's not afraid to make sickening lane
Yah! Shouts to CuDi just doing what feels right
Shouts to kids who don't know what they really like
'Cause we're the same, we're just making music every night
And we're the reason why these A&amp;R's are getting fired
Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless

(Oh yeah)
Anxiety dances... across my pillow case, my God it dances
It's like, 1, 2 step
It's asking stupid questions
Like "are you living right?" Such stupid questions
Because I'm just trying to
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise, above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-Insert something really dope right here
I'm supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)
I'm supposed to write a f'in hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)
I've been working my ass off
That's why Christina left me, been working my ass off
On this project, but I guess that it's okay
My family never liked you, I guess that it's okay
Now I'm just I'm just
I'm trying live I'm trying rise
Above the shit the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-Insert something really dope right here
I'm supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)
I'm supposed to write a f'in hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)
Listen boo boo, bear with me (yeah)
Smarter than your average
Raised around Brooklyn based Italian
There's so much soul up in my Johnson, I don't need a rapper on it
Because the urbans in my testes but I come and pop packaging (yikes)
Bunch of pricks talk shit, we call that cactusing
We don't want no fight club don't want no Brad Pitt'in
Braymance like this shit just when I'm ad-libbin'
Fronting on my Sean Penn what movie are you actin' in?
Seventh grade I said "I'm bout to leave the masses then"
My ex-girlfriend's sister said "you babbling"
Even back then cook crack, drug trafficking
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise, above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
(You're gonna be okay kid, you're gonna be, okay)

I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
My name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there
2 rocking chairs
Leaves fall
Rain dries
Snow melts
Fame dies
Four words, simply
Grow old, with me
And when the day comes
When we can't walk no more
We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me
Yeah

In your eyes

Grow old with me

I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap clap clap so what)
Still lost, still feeling anxious, still worried 'bout the same shit
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap clap clap so what)
Still lost, still feel depressed like I'm tryna find a way in
(Doo-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh)
I'm tryna figure this out but my god I'm so human
(Doo-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh)
So I turned to my sister and smiled and asked this question
All we wanna know
Is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop, ever stop to watch them shine?

But do we ever stop, ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with, staring with ungrateful eyes?

Yeah, yeah!
Your father said he would break my legs
If I ever came around again!
I don't mind risking the wheelchair
If we could get another round in
Oh-ooh-oh you told him you would stay away
But here you are, I kiss your face
You touch my chest, I feel your legs
We're in too far (yeah!), I hear you say (yeah!)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)
It's dangerous in the action sequence
And I'm ready to die hard!
It's like we're stuck in an 80's movies
As you're sneaking into my car!
Oh-ooh-oh you told him you would stay away
But here you are, I kiss your face
You touch my chest, I feel your legs
We're in too far (yeah!), I hear you say (yeah!)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)
As we wake up in my car, you're on my chest
Oh, and you got ninety missed calls, one hundred texts
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
Screw your pops, let's get some IHOP
But before we go
You told me that we should do it
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)
One more time
(I need you, I need you, I need you!)

Open up the doors in the back of church
And they all rise
They all rise
Take a couple steps of my breath in a dress
That is all white
It's all white
As your father lets you go
He will whisper soft and slow
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love
This money's gonna come
And this money's gonna go
But that's alright
That's alright
'Cause everything could fall down
Everything could go
But it's all fine
It's all fine
They say love's a winding road
But it's simple if we both
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love
Even the philosophers know, it's a fact
That we all die
We all die
I know you're an angel
So if they call you back in a short time
A short time
And you leave me in this life
I will follow close behind
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love

I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit
I grew up in the age of Timberland and Pharrell shit

Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?
Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?
Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking
Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done
Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so
I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along
My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I don't know no hoodlum and you don't pass the test
I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along
Oh, baby, I'm standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now
My momma say that it was wrong to see you
I lie just to meet you, I lie to get in
And my momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin
So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden
My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she'd ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too
I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true
There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do
There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, if it's less like I am dreaming
Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
There's a fear I have, a feeling real bad
I'm final if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to cry, to thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking
It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

Little bits and pieces, falling to the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
Smiles from the stranger, seem to change a day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is our feeling, all my hurt is over
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you till you left
So you went away
Where did you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend
You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With the song
You like to write about all of your problems
The damning songs because you think it was often
But you're wrong
Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must I come to this?
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody
Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy
I love you anyway
No matter what what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Heaven know how to fight
I guess I want
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you couldn't
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere
And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night time
Cliches find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile
And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
A dark room in the night time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot lack of lustre
He'll try tonight
Tonight get higher
He'll try tonight
Tonight I'll get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes, he will

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out
All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Till you are home, dear
I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt our lives were
Going to be fun
When we were always
Waiting to live
All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
I'll be it all, dear
You have the choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep
All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear
Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blind
And look outside
And in the orange light
The fog is rising
This is life
The still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

What an unusual name you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh, what you mean to me
And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might
I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always
There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive sign on his arm, oh, my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he knows she'll never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said, how did I know you so well?
Why am I not surprised?
He said, baby, go to hell
And that was the demise, of their love
Don't ever pick up the man
If you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you
Have a history of being a loving fool
So, that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know him so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh, tell me
With all of your might?
I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
My love

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I touch you
Then I won't touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor
My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave
Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're going to want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't want to keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't
My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave
Aren't you going to miss me?
Honey, I'll miss you
I just want to kiss you
Tonight
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so
My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm the fan of flying
Want to do it for the nation
'Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but committed to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation
Do you think I'm crazy
'Cause I'm up and leaving, baby
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the flight
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation
Do you think I'm crazy
'Cause I'm going to Pensacola
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
'Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way
I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm going to take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I'll see the way you'll be lying, be abused
I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think
Breathing, getting fire to them
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you
We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think
I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
And I don't care what you think

You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you
I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride
I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing
I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride
It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful
It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

Met you in front of the diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right
So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds
You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun
So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze
So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?
You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?
K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?
Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

Well, you know it, and I know it
I'm going to be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind
Is carrying
Me home, me home
Me home again
We all know it, and I know it
Going to be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far
You saw life
Back in the countryside
Oh, my soul
Rise up and go
Beyond, beyond
To what you know

I look for you in magazines

I'm taking off my wedding ring

I like the snake on your tattoo,
I like the ivy and the ink blue,
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.
You have to take me right now,
From this dark trailer park life now,
Yayo, how now, yayo.
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.

Like a druggie, like I told you.

Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can
Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray is going to meet you?
Love you, I do; stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand

Give me coffee, king-sized cup
Come on, kitty cat, fill her up
What's your name, little buttercup?
That's for me to know and you to make up
Love casinos and neon reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station
Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder, yo, you like so nice
Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, I spend them looking for men you might like
Like you
Like you
Like you
Love casinos and neon reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station
Take me to the gas station
Give me coffee, Utah love
I'm the kind of girl you dream of
I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smoking inside
If you can swing it
Can I be real pleased if we could find one just like here
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Love casinos and neon reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station
Gas station
Gas station

Oh, say can you see my stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys and look at the bars
Night time is almost ours
The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The night time is almost ours
A sway of the hips and arms
We'll cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired and send you to Mars
Night time is almost ours

Gramma said she'll leave the lights on for me
Gramma said the flags are waving for me
Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man, waiting for me
A.M.E.R.I.C.A.
All I want to do is play
See the city every day
Pretty party nation

Happy that I make you glad

Now I'm out to get you
But I'd have bet that lately, Ma
And I'm in love with everyone
And I don't want to think I'm wrong
Just for feeling pretty

All right, you got me, I don't play a good guitar
But what do want from me, it's just a stupid bar
I didn't promise anything, no
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're going get along
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You want here, no?
You want here, no?
Pretty baby
Pretty baby

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day
Of the summer
Buy my purple wig
For my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live
In my motel
On Neptune Avenue.
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
Maybe we could go to 
Suede Tokyo
We'll see Van Halen at their re-union show.
Heavy metal hour on T.V.
Diamond Dave and Ray late
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up
Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up

It's the voodoo, Mississippi south
Sixty-nine million stars
Birds are flying out of my mouth
Spirits creeping in my yard
Hold my head, it's tilting back
Something dancing me around
Putting crystals on my neck
Lifting my feet off the ground, the ground
Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up
Rai-, rai-, rai-, raise me up
Rai-, raise me up
Rai-, raise me up
Oh, see, look what you've done now
Oh, me, just what I'm talking about
Oh, see, look what you've done now
Oh, me, it's what I'm talking 'bout
It's what I'm talking 'bout
It's what I'm talking about
Pick me up in a pickup truck
Roll down, you've got it going on
Let me talk on your C.B., what?
Let me play with your new shotgun, shotgun

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right, but letting nice things go
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's going to take money to go
Oh, no
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
I can't do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right, but letting nice things go

You know, a lot of people ask me
Why I feel, that, you know
I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And, umm, I don't know
People seem to be under the impression
That, I made it to this point, FAST
And, y'know obviously for me
I don't feel like that 'cause it's me y'know
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years
But, every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far
Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten
Until you look around and, and you look at the people who
Who, who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that, that no matter what, it's
In the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
It's not gonna be about my connections
It's not gonna be about my looks
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most
Annnnd, I want it the most!

I just came out of the muthafuckin' old school
Got my mac notebook with the pro tools
Y'all bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof flyer then a frisby
So I'm up in (?) eating mangoes

Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star they say wen I star spangle
But for buh; buh; buh; buh

Ma Mon-Montana so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then reindeers in the winter
I get crazy

Nicki Minaj:
So I got the bad bitch mentality 'cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the oval office then the lights out
'Cause I am the wicked witch I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I am Nicki LMNO-winsky
I mean my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean tinker
Tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker
Weezy:
1 2 3rd Floor
Hospital Bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straight jacket crooked, I hear you lookin'
I promise I'm hard, and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes I am
Right up in the coo-coo nest I land
I'm' fly now eat my bird shit
Yeah I'm crazy, I'm' crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm looking for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F. Baby, no, Weezy F. Crazy

I got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper.
Brinx:
Now you hold it your excellence
See I t.c oh forward slash president
East side resident oh so evident
Brinx Billy ride cousin black on black phantom 26s on the side of 'em
Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of 'em
Anybody can get it boy be careful on the side of them
These niggas are burial guns no fearial
Money hungry honey with me if you holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial vechical gerital
Sittin' on my feet when I'm stuntin' on them people
I tell no fables everything chillin'
Fax machines office max see me for that paper
You workin' for short bread ain't my money long younging
Bitch I'm on trappin' more digits than a phone number different time zones on 'em Kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris left side flaggin' paper is my main chick me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch that's why them brand new niggas is all up on my old shit
(Speaking: Nicki Minaj)
That's what I did I came up out the truck, you know what I'm sayin'

Young Money, Nicki Minaj it's the ninja, Harajuku Barbie and all of that
Nah I'm sayin' all that me gettin' money you writin' disses we gettin' money

And you can find me sittin' Indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yin and say sayonara
I'm meditating, I'm in conhoots with a higher power
Mind on money mi-mi-mind on my money yo
Mind on my money mi-mi-mind (yo ho rai que quo)
Mind on money aye, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste? Whining on money's face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now and go get your gangs signs, throw it up!
Where all my niggas on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't going away
My niggas bring the heat, it's not a summer day
So mind on my motherfuckin' money, my mind on my motherfuckin' money.
(Speakin: Busta Rhymes)
Ayo I speak foreign languages and shit but the language I speak is that money language (laughs) flipmode bitch
Brinx I like how we do the brinx truck job on these niggas homey
Time after time again I like niggas and remind niggas how I hold out on motherfuckers
Niggas out here frontin' about they bread you can't trust it niggas my money so Stupid call me warren Busta buss nigga
Glad it ain't a toss and everything about me butters I've been counting money so Long I see dollar signs and different colors
My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother

Sorry lil' daddy that cards not valid

With them real big faces
Louis Vuitton cases
Hoes in the hood say Nicki Minaj booshie...
I do it b.I.g. so I keep a couple coogies, hoes

Yo, SB. I think it's my time...
You know why? My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money
If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!
Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!)
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line
Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei
So I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?)
This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me)
If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me, you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!
Lil Wayne:
From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like vibe and no water
Better yet, like Bubba, no shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm that just a summa bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
It yee ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't cover my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nick
It ain't fuckin' with me it ain't fuckin' with Nick
Your girlfriend, her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nick, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my Le Bitch (?) cause, I swear y'all's a fuckin' trip
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country bitch
Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Mad, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him,

Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you.",
Bxtches know I beast this,

And they know I stay around the white like a groom,
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom.
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply,
Yellin' "Rasta, all right! " when I'm ridin' by,
See I used to be the wife of a king,
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.

Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin,
Now I get'cha ching and my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding.

Begged my skio,
Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo.
Anyway, I'm the ninja,
Kawasaki blazin',
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians.
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son,
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done.
'Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin',
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman.
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')
I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my auntie,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' [x2]
Can you hear the yellin'?

Got all these lil bitches g-gettin' the pink heer (hair)
I'm pretty and I'm fly I'm up in a pink lear
I needed an assistant I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office with flowers and pink cheers (chairs)
Cheers, Cheers!
Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky the Mistress
Where the fuck is the President?! Haha Young Money!

(Verse: Gucci Mane)
Hot dammit it's a miracle,
Please adjust the temperature
I switched up the interior in my European 50
Damn Gucci lyrical
Nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria,
With brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were richer than a year ago with
Three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was error and rude same color as a prune yellow
Chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Roon hearing ert-ert when it skert 26's on the skirt's
And a bird with a flirt
You can tirt I got twerk I keep work
In my birds I got bird I got bricks
I got pounds of that herbs (yeah)
Use to be my favorite word
Now my ice game is superb so them hoes can suck my dick
(Chorus: Nicki Minaj)
Y'all be tryin' hard (but it's easy), tightin' up on yo job ('cause it's easy)
I'm Nicki Minaj (so be easy), Gucci Mane and Rocko (please believe it)

(Verse: Nicki Minaj)
Zoom boom I'm 5'4 double R zoom zoom

Goons yellin' poon, poon when you're really coon coon
I eat these rap bitches no fork no spoon
I'm Nicki I been Nicki I'm picky
I stay around the six like that little mouse mickey
Ask Rocko ask Gucci, ask Gucci, Gucci bandana
I'm a star I'm the black Hannah Montana
I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl
I'm sippin' on my milkshake with this swirly swirl
Excuse me mister put some cheeries in my cups
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts
Boys goes nuts boys-boys goes nuts
All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck
My niqqa S Beezy keep my wrist breezy
Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy
(Chorus: Nicki Minaj)
Y'all be tryin' hard (but it's easy), tightin' up on yo job ('cause it's easy)
I'm Nicki Minaj (so be easy), Gucci Mane and Rocko (please believe it)
Y'all be tryin' hard (but it's easy), tightin' up on yo job ('cause it's easy)

Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving?
At the precinct writing statements on which your house is the station (damn)
Not I, tattle tellin' is for homos
Besides, that's the number 1 Young Money no no
Police, we don't chat with them
We ain't got no wrap for them
You in the cop car point niggas out from the back of them (There he go)
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I'm black, and yous a fuckin' goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the half way house and ask your supervisor
Where my straitjacket at... I'm a psycho

I'm the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes uh huh, Washington
Betta ask around, 'cause I'm what's popping-ton

Coulda killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck 'em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect 'em
I could AK attack 'em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
'Cause I'm God's gift like a present

Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all

And I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nic of time it just dawned on
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win
Maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me 'cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D.
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school)
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?

Yeah yeah uh huh
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin'
I heard she move dem thangs
I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain
She trynna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks tha same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she frum Queens right?
And what's her nationality, she Chinese right?
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch fall back!
See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't neva comin' out, look at currency
But every time she do a interview you know I run to see
She get me so sick it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki
Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day you'll remember dis
One day wen we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is, good enough for music biz
For you, for you
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens for me that means you
Just gotta a betta opportunity to do you
They don't understand these labels look at numbers is statistics
I lose, you lose, mines just legastic
Any way, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetins (kyea)
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Common, you can ask Chris
Lady when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's duckin' the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi
Stay around da white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-poppin' on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!
Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I mite crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day you'll remember dis
One day wen we reminisce
Nothin' I do ever is, good enough for music biz

(Nicki Minaj) 
I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin 
So far ahead, these bums is laggin' 
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin' 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin' 
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been? 
Yeah, I said it, has-been 
Hang it up, flatscreen 
(Haha) Plasma 
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma 
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine 
I got bars, Xenocin 
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt 
And I'll kick that hoe, punt 
Forced trauma, blunt 
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front 
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it 
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with 
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock 
I am a movie, camera block 
You outta work, I know it's tough 
But enough is enough 
I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight 
(Eminem) 
I ain't into S&amp;M, but my whip's off the chain 
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame 
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame 
You don't like it then peel off, bitch 
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off 
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
Quit hollerin' "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it 
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad 
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra 
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad 
With fake tits and a bad dye job 
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad 
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
Look, two pees and a tripod! 
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod? 
Kick it back in its face, my God 
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd 
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) 
I feel uglyx3
Slut don't touch me or hug me 
I'm mad And I pity Any girl who gets with me tonight 
(Nicki Minaj) 
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight? 
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite 
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike 
Now all my ***** gettin' bucked, overbite 
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's 
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs 
I call the play, now do you see why? 
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli 
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin' 
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin' 
Overseas, church, Vatican 
You at a stand, still, mannequin 
(Eminem) 
All you li'l faggots can suck it 
No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets 
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend 
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if 
You have the same passion that I have 
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass 
You assdicks had gastric bypass 
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass 
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!) 
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony 
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass 
You know what time it is, so why ask? 
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class 
It's (high class) meets (white trash) 
I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay 
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight

Yuh done know

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you crazy
(Young Buc)
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)
(Lloyd Banks)
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.
(50 Cent)
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla tonight
I wanna get to know you
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, lady
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy
(x2)
I wanna be your lover
I really understand you, baby
I want to be your lover
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...
S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...
Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...
S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...
Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Find me in the dark, I'll be in the stars;
Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...
Your love... your love, your love...
Baby, you're the illest...
Your love...
Your love...

Yo Cassie
You a bad bitch I'mma call you Lassie
Just left the tour last date Tallahasse
Don't mind me
Even witcha GPS couldn't find me
Lookin' at this boy I'mma call him McDreamy
I was wonderin' if he got a good Dick Cheney
Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!
(Cassie's part...)
Is that my cue
I'm lookin' for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT sc-scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Loui Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him
Thought he was a queen I dr-dr-dragged him
Dodged to the room and whipped out the magnum
Slim, trim, also light skin
Now P-P-Peter put the pipe in
Yes sir I am that bitch
Fuck you Silly like the rabbit
*Giggles*
Giddy Up Giddy Up
Now wake Diddy up Diddy up Diddy up

Might rock some juicy jeans

Maybe some lose your giusepp's
I play foul no free throw
Bitch I ball no pre-show
Dead ass no peep show!
Brought a run pronto
With a front condo
Daughter, son, John Doe
Watching tele-mundo
Flyer than a rocket
Money in my Polly Pocket

Keep that work inside my Pippy Long Stockings
Bitch!

It's not chipped, we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah, Young Money
Nicki Minaj, you're such a Barbie
Yo, Mariah, I was in a million dollar meetin' he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away while the mice will play
L-O-L, smiley-face, have a nice day
'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop censoring that contraband
'Cause you was penny-pinchin', my accounts laced
Attention, about-face
I thought we had something special and we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walkin' by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you're on a sofa and I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house
When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby, I break
So look who's cryin' now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talkin' about you're missin' your boo, hoo-hoo
I know you ain't getting it, I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you'll wonder who I'm messin' with
While you ain't next to me
I'm going bye, so pay the consequences
'Cause you acting all ignorant
So you ashamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house, when I break, I break
Stylin' on them big B's with the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top dogs, yeah, we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose
They be like, "She next", Kawasaki, T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left? Let his momma pick it up
Might back-up on it, vroom-vroom, with a pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmello Jag
I bob and weave and hit them with the Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like I'm hotter than a yellow tag
'Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this s***
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this s**
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two lego blocks even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
(I told you, I put, I put your stuff on the side walk)
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
(I will go over every nook and cranny with a pick-up truck)
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
(Like straight up and down, this is Nicki Minaj, if they ask about me, Young Money)
They're collecting my bags, baby, I break boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to Paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones I can feel you
Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway

To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I know that look on your face, that I had lost you
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
'Cause you love me enough to let go of me
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?
Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?

I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you
I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good
I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you
I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

Down to my last match fire I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?
Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror
Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

Fighting flames of fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Hey, I was doing just fine just before I met you
I drank too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as the good as the day as I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-One Eighty-Two song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay?
I know it breaks your heart
I moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older

Bend your chest open so I can read your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and pick you apart
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna pick your brain and get to know your thoughts
So I can read your mind when you don't wanna talk
And can I touch your face before you go
I collect your scales but you don't have to know
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you inside out
(Your love, inside out)
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Inside out

Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you)
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you)
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
(I'm gonna love you)

Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down

So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh no
Said don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds
Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet
Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one
(You know, I'm sorry)
(I'm sorry)
No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it
"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable
And I know you say you want it now (want it now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it
Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though
And I know you say you need me now (need me now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it
I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I, I, I, really fucking meant it

Dropping bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hits you all at once
I'm already tired and it's the morning
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughing
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darling, I have to cut you off
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human
You say you've regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault

Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human
No way, no way you're human

You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you
But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of
But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type

I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Oh, I wanna know ya

Is one of those strangers you?
And do you notice me too?
Oh, I wanna know ya

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are better
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better

It's 5 AM and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
It's 6 AM, I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
If I'm being honest

Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You got real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone?

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything that did is function
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can go from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can go from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive

It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby here I go again
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize this happenin'
Baby here I go again
Here I Go Again
Still remember how you make me weak
How so hard to find the words to speak
I just can't excape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
But I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

I want to let you know

Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinkin' that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did for my heart went through bad
But I'm still standin tall as I walk away
And you know that its true when you hear me say
It's over, its through
And nothin' you can do boy its sad but its true
It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Good Byeee No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife
It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over its through nothin' you can do and wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye
Baby goodbye
Never gunna never gunna cry no more
Goodbye goodbye

Baby slow down just here me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need push no need to rush
You know you had me from hello
When it comes to my heart I don't play
Baby boy can't you see the stop sign
Your movin much to fast
Baby love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last
Baby if your willing to wait
We just take our time
Don't you know that it's getting late
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
Its mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby if your willing to wait
We can just take our time
Boy can't you see I'm not tryna be
The girl who gets taken for a ride
If you take your time and you will find
There's so much more to me inside
And just say there's no need to delay
Your telling me to trust you
Boy you know I want to baby
But my heart gets so recently break
Before we take this very far show me who you really are
(Chorus out)

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh yeah
Listen, closely hear the music playing
Let it take you to places far away and
Relax your senses just do what you want to do
No need for questions
It's only for you
And it's so amazing
Oh how you can't escape it
The moon it takes you
And never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles it's all right
Let them go till we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun (the sun yeah)
So real
So right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings the life you needin
No need for stress, (no need for stress)
Let go another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say
And it's so amazing
On how you can't escape it
The moment takes you it never lets you Go!
Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there (let the rhythm take you there)

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha hada alot a game, and he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine
(Hook) There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I don't care whos hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but every time that he's around
My heart don't lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
(Rap)
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million that's what you are to me
Anda I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be alot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving that's all I'm giving
Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know it's the real thing, if you don't whatever
And I know its meant to be
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry

Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you read a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can't you see
It's the way it's gotta be
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know

Lala lala lala lala, oh
You know, I never felt like this before
Lala lala lala lala, oh
Just feels like somethin' real
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help
SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you, I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel
SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making (Y-O-U) this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go
Almost how the wind will blow
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lustin'
So you see you and me
We're gettin' close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
So you see you and me
We're gettin' close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't

Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride

I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yeah)
'Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think it's so sad
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye

Ooh Yeah

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa ho yeah
My bestfriends tell me Rihanna
What's got into you
I say Rihandra I can't explain

Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way
I try my best to wear a disguise
But it's written on my face
(J-Status)

I wanna to talk to you and not to mention good love that you give to me I think about it constantly no I
Won't apologize for feeling like I do it's just the simple facts of life I'm crazy over you
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day I'm addicted to what your giving me boy

They might see I'm a bit extreme to need you night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't
No other way
(Bridge and fade)

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
And it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the TV
Boy it ain't easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' New To Say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the Answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror on the wall

Here we lay face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
And I'm wondering who will be the first
To say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens
And we should be letting go.
It feels like you're a million miles away
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
Cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
From what we were just like the seasons love has changed
And every I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.
(Music Plays:)
We can try to talk it over
But we walked that road before
Boy, our song has played its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door.

(Feat. Corey Gunz)

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
You and me we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying to hard to play cool
I don't mind I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time sometimes the heart rearranges
As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
Ooh heyyay
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there'right there
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothin'
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?

Don't want to be another craze
How about rather not see and I turn my face
Don't want to leave you unfinished
And resting on the noise that you left
I don't want to leave you mistaken, forsaken
Lying with the rest
I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
I don't want to be a woman that
You wish you never met
I don't want you to kill my name
And ask if I'm hovering him
I won't send and gather dust
In the corners of your world
Cause believe me, when you leave me
It won't be a minute too soon
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started

I like to take you
Only 'cause I choose
Not to leave you
I like to make something of you
Only 'cause I choose to believe in you
I don't want to want you
Like I do
I don't want to want you
Like I do
Like I do
I, I like to show you
Only 'cause I choose
Not to hide from you
I like to know you
Only 'cause I choose to introduce myself
Only 'cause I choose to introduce myself
I don't want to want you
Like I do
Like I do
I don't want to want you
Like I do
Like I do, like I do
I like to take you
Only 'cause I choose
Not to leave you
I like to make something of you
Only 'cause I choose to believe in you
I don't want to want you

You, and you alone
You, and you alone
Have the power to be the master of your life
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You... you alone
Granted you're taking me for a sucker
When I am not
Gradually, we'll patch up mends and I'll make you see
What I've got
Apparently you're taking me for a slip on
You've gotta tie me up
Eventually you will tamper mends, I'll make you see
I am enough
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
Obviously, you're taking me for what suits you
When I don't
With slow ease I'll show you disgraced, you were on my knees
You know I won
Foolishly, you're taking me for a sleeper
When I'm quite awake
Evidently we've not through been me, your intense scene
And you'll now break
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You, and you alone
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You, and you alone

How can I climb inside you
The way that you're climbing inside me
How could I ever deny you
The way that you never deny me
How can I climb inside you
Touching the parts that people really see
How can I open and find you
And feel you the way that you want me to feel
I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell
I wanna tell you a little bit more
How do I get to align with you
(?) times I will see
If we can piece together something
Or something else that will be
Can't believe that you're less
I'm still not against your will
A change that you really want too
If I pour it all out
Will you still have no doubt
There's a reason or two that you are too
I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell
I wanna tell you a little bit more
How can I climb inside you

If I pour it all out
Will you still have no doubt
There's a reason or two that you are too

Your insensitivity is your personality
A trade that's least favourite
Ha ha funny, you think you're so funny
But you hurt my feelings
We've had some good dealings
What have I done recently to make you so mean to me?
I'm oversensitive you say but I think you're nasty today
You make me feel nasty like a control freak
I just want to feel helpful like I'm needed
A sense of reason
You tell your friends I'm a fucking kook -
Look how long it took
I've been like this all the time
You don't know what it's like to be me -
You're not paranoid, neurotic - you're free
I don't like me much anymore
You make me feel a burden
You make me feel like a bore

Well I live here with you
In, in a kind of "yes, will do"
Oh what part of now don't you understand
I'm showing you well apparent
Yeah I get the bluff if I'll get out
No room for three, you, me and your doubts
One of us has got to leave
And it'll sure be me
And I think we could have a situation
We could have a situation
Any reason we can't just settle around now
Yeah, ok, and how?
Rather than shout and praise
(?) with them, not without (?)
Oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand
I think I made it clear that you're in the mend
In the mend
Oh, we could have a situation
Oh, we could have a situation

Yes, you can take that to heart
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
You can make it a big issue
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok
You can feign a distant familiarity
You say you understand the similarity
You think you see me with great clarity
But you're acting me, not necessarily
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
Yes, you can call that a start
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
Yes, your deceit is an art
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway
You say you have the best intentions
You fill me with fickle suggestions
Logic is fired by inventions
But your concern is much more than you mention
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
You say you know my situation
You say you've been confused by my complication
You think my soul makes negotiation
But you don't see my hesitation
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

People are talking, well that's nothing new
And some things will never change
Stories are turning away from the truth
But people will stay the same
It's only natural that we go on
To meet with the days that will come
It's only natural that we all carried forward
So step on, go on
Get rising like the morning sun
There's no need to take it to heart
There's no need to take it to heart
Only the truth can tear you apart
There's no need to take it to heart
Well stand tall and (?)
And don't let it get you down
Make them all feel (?)
But for you I will (?) my ground

I sometimes believe that everything I dream
Will one day be my reality
I sometimes think that every move I make
Will gather in shape in my reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I sometimes search for signs my dreams can work
Until I stand alert with my reality
I sometimes look in paradise by the book
To give back what I took from my reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality
Beautiful, beautiful reality
A beautiful reality
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful reality

Like a new winter's coat
I'm wearing your last embrace
Like a cold quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty
I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten no protest
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be bored and lonely
Soon I'll be bored and lonely
Like a story well told
Your conversation can hold me or soothe me
Like a funny time to share you were there
And your comfort and support me
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be restless and weary
Soon I'll be restless and weary
Like another man
I want hold you within me
Like a good day without care
I just want you to last
I just want you to last
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste linger left on lips
I think of your kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers left on lips
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed

I, I, I never would have thought it would end this way, I lied
I never have believed that we would separate
What we have now is how it stands
And now I wish you'll try to make it stay
The way we are is here and now
I wish you'd make the most of all we have today
Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot
I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more
I never meant to let you down, down
Though the silver lining wears through
I still do not mean to hurt you, no
When the sound of your voice is not ringing through
Beginning to question whether I should be around
Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot

My mother's afraid of the subway
It's a living bad dream
I hold her hand as the doors close
And she pales and stifles a scream
Ali's afraid of ad-libbing
Of improvising at jams
She is not very happy right now
And spends all her money on grams
Ade is afraid of commitment
So Carla dumped him today
She is very disappointed
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay
Ayo, he just wants a girlfriend
He's afraid of dying alone
He doesn't go out very much
Sits at home a lot getting stoned
You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear
Ella is worried about her weight
She won't eat in public anymore
She is fucking her ex again
When they've finished, she sleeps on the floor
Nate has a heart of gold
But give it away he will not
His mother abandoned him at ten
It's a pain he has never forgot
Mary's afraid of herself
Her sentences often cut half
She will never give her own opinion
She's afraid that people might laugh
And I am afraid of sharks
I will not swim out past my head
And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die
My first love is already dead
You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear
You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear
Candy is having a baby
She fears she will be like her mom
Her friends say, "Relax, take a deep breath
And march to a different drum"
Sachas afraid of her Marco
She think's that it's all her fault
But if he did what he does to a stranger
He'd be locked up and charged with assault
You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Eat food to satisfy my hunger
I drink water to quench my thirst
Use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
And prick with pin to watch it burst
To make noise I use my breathe
To unlock doors I use a key
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes
Use booze to unlock me
Sweep so I can sleep (x2)
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep
Wear shoes so I can run
As to avoid the broken glass
Wear the pants because they suit me
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh
I'll close the door to have a cry
They say that change and pain is a positive thing
Have I changed since you died
Sweep so I can sleep (x2)
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep
Don't ask my why I smoke I don't know
But I drink to get drunk (x4)

I'm sitting in the car again
Waiting for you
You said you'd be a minute
But you've been twenty two
See you've got to do your hair
And get it just right
Sometimes you're in the bathroom
For half of the night
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
Now I'm sitting by the phone again
Waiting for your call
You said you'd phone at two
And it's a quarter past four
Now I'm standing out the front again
It's late at night
And I'm truly sick to death of sleazy men
Undressing me with their eyes
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
So I'm back from the theater
I watched the show alone
See, I waited for you and I missed half act one
Have you never heard of the phone?
I don't like being taken for granted
I'm too nice for my own good
You see I do what I say, and I say what I do
Is it too much to expect that you could?
I wish you would
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
It's the usual coup
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't missing nothing for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool

Without a sound ever heard
Without a lesson I've learned
You're foolish
And diluted
Too many lies have you burned
Where there's eyes to be found
This seems life's underground
But even if you had it all
You would find
I could never let you stay
'Cause you blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
If you go
I will stall
Yes I see it
Yes I feel it
You have no questions at all
But if life is truly devoured
I'll strip your bare 'til truth comes out
But even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all
You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat) 
Forever is your mind to be naive 
Remember 
It will bring us to our knees 
You blow it all away
'Cause even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all
You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat)

Now I don't mind if you find that I'm a shoulder to cry on rely on
But the burden is just too much I'm losing touch with myself and my health
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
Now I don't keep you from your sleep I need some ease I'm tired of trying to please
And it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me

You took me for granted
You took me, you took me for granted
But I landed back on my feet, back on
My feet
'Cause you don't deserve me, deserve me
You don't have the time that I need
That I want, I deserve
But I got back my nerve
Did what was right for me
I'm using my head not my heart
And I'm starting new
I'm going to get over you, over you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
You happy is all I wanted to see, is all
I wanted to see, to see
And so now that's what
I'm going to be, what I'm going to be
I'll waste some time on me
I gave you my all and you took it
I saw and you gave nothing back
Your mind on another track,
Another track, another track yeah
There are plenty of people out there
Who would care about me
You'll see
You'll see
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you

Like a new winters coat
I'm wearing your last embrace
Like cool quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be cold and thirsty
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be cold and thirsty
I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten, no protest
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be bored and lonely
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be bored and lonely
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste lingers, left on lips
I'm tasting your sweet kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers, left on lips
So, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be sober and unkissed
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
'Cause soon, I'll be sober and unkissed
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around
Oh, when are you coming around

'Cause soon, I'll be sober and unkissed

Healing is difficult
Often results in psychosomatic
I admit to enjoying drugs
They get rid of tension, boredom and static
Hate those adverse side effects
Forcing the people who love me to scatter
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite
The way I see it really doesn't matter
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
To tell you the truth
I can't believe I love you so much
So much in fact that I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch
I have a sick sense of humor
It amazes me how points it scores
I'm addicted to vice
My best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely
Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Waking up next to you
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy
The flies in the front room
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me
If I contract illness
The last thing I want is to pass it to others
Fucking leaves guilt pangs
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Judge me feel free
'Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
It's such a terrible terrible shame
You keep on judging me, in his name
You're so quick to shift the focus
'Cause you can find yourself
In today's frame
But I know he's approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly
Just me feel free
'Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
It's truly sad to see
You suffering so immensely
You need distracting
So you use me conveniently
But I know he'd approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Yor smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan
Little man I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with joy
As I grow older, you grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorise where I've gone wrong
If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
Little man yor head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day touring
Your imagination
If I live longer you'll grow faster
At recognising the traps that cause
Me such frustration
If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
(x3)
So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan

Mind you mind me
You thought you could climb me
I'm sorry to cut your rope
Bu in you I've lost all hope
Mind you mind me
I haven't seen you lately
Oh how many times you liked to phone
To see if your seed I could sow
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
Mind you mind me
I laught at your transparency
You're my new best friend
Your fucked up life can I mend
Mind you mind me
I find it interesting to see
When I only offer you a smile, oh how
You forget to dial
Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously (repeat)
Mind you mind me, you smile so sweetly
I'd call you an acquaintance stop with
Your exaggeration
Mind you mind me
How things can change is a good week
Call me ruthless
But you stretch the truth oh yes
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without

You don't know me
You can't hold me
I'll slip through your hands
I am one single grain of sand
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
I'm an empty space
I can't be replaced
So when you're finished with this dream
Delete begin to rewrite me
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
Delete and rewrite me

For those who slept
For those who kept
Themselves jacked up
How Jesus wept
Sunday
Sunday
For those in need
For those who speed
For those who try to slow their minds with weed
Sunday 
Sunday
For those who wake
With a blind headache
Who must be still
Who sit and wait
For Sunday to be Monday
Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away
For those with guilt
For those who wilt under pressure
No tears over spilt milk
Sunday
Sunday
Sunday

Sunday
Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away
Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away

Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

How you been feeling
It's not about marbles, snakes or glue
How you been healing
Now that we cannot win or lose
So how you been keeping
It doesn't matter whose dad's richest now
How you been sleeping
From the top bunks further to fall down
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
What you been doing
Still making the world a better place
Never stopped rueing
Making those tears fall down your face
Making you suffer
Wondering how you got your scars
And only in hindsight
I wish I had taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)

She cooks you sweet potato, you don't like aubergine
She knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease
She senses you are lonely but still she can't be sure
And so she stands and waits, stands anticipating your thoughts
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be
To understand you
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be
To understand you
He brushes thoroughly
He knows she likes fresh breath
He rushes to the station
He waits atop the steps
He's brought with a mars bar
She will not buy nestle
And later he'll perform
A love-lorn serenade, a trade
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be
To understand you
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be
To understand you
So give her information to help her fill her holes
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin
Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed
I hate that you negate me I'm a ghost at beck and call
I'm fading and placating, berate myself for staying
I'm a fool
I'm a fool
He greets this stranger meekly a thing that she accepts
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps
He senses she is lonely, she's glad they finally met
They take each other's hands, walk into the sunset
Do you like sweet potato

Faint light of dawn
I'm listening to you breathing in and out
Needing nothing
You're honey dipped
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world
I can't feel my lips
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down
Then all of that's annulled and I'm anyone's
Everyone's, we are one
Your face becomes the sun
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things
Those little things
The little things they bring
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this
Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

Aaliyah:

'Cause I'm loving the way you looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty watch me knock your boots off
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon'stop us

The Weeknd:
Music got you lost
Nights ends so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But baby it's okay, they my niggas next door
They be working in the trap, so get louder if you want
Just don't blame it on me girl
That you didn't call your home
Just don't blame it on me girl
'Cause you wanted to have fun
If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it

With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables

She give me sex in a handbag

And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out

Rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four
My sessions are the strong on your floor
Shouldn't have fucking rolled
But I fucking rolled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walk through the store
When I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it but I made it that's for sure
For sure, loving I need more, I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it though, sippin' on this
Baby livin' off bliss got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Oh you
You, oh you
'Cause I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No calls worth stopping
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you
Oh you, you
Oh you, Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh I got it girl

I got somethin' to tell you
But don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing:
Girl, I been bad again
Girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em but I'm fading
I forget
I forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me
Pick

So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fucking seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day)
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rolling through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fucking twenty, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doing in the bathroom?
I hear noises in the bathroom
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have twenty different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us

My love so lost in my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted

You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay

I'mma give you what you fiend
But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
'Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I get with the fuckin' loose girls
By the way I fuckin' did it
And you won't ever fuckin' know
'Cause I won't ever fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from that other cup of potion
Dirty spiked toastin
Fast life fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the mix flow
Let the night flow
I'm so gone
Let these meds flow
I'm so gone
Let these meds flow
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
Whoa, whoa, oh
Said I'm gone gone gone
Whoa oh
I'm so gone
Gone

Now your thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognize
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
'Cause I've been on these streets way too long
Baby I've been on this too long
It's getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another seroton'
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking till I can't hit another note
Ooh, but until then
I got you
Baby I got you
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you
So baby love me
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me
Because they all left me
I'll be different
I think I'll be different
I hope I'm not different
And I hope you'll still listen
But until then
Baby I got you
I got you
Girl I still got you
I got you

I'm paying for all my father's sins
So I will thank him for you
I'mma thank him for you
My serotonin's got a while to go
Girl, it's gone cause of you
It's been gone cause of you
They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I got heaven
Well I say, I am God
I never prayed a moment in my life
Girl I'm rewarded with you
I've been rewarded with you
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh
Let me kiss it for you
I can kiss it for you
They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I have heaven
I say, I am God

Oh no
Oh no, oh no
You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me
I know your every move so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, ooh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh
She said, "I have to go home 'cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight"
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone, sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door because I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh
Oh no
Oh no

Oh no

I'll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used, to do
Girl I'm open to anything that would get you into that zone
And understand that we're all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know what's in store
Baby I will stay up all night
I've been goin' hard since last night
And I'ma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
Ooh I'm tellin' you this ain't the same
And I know he's still in your brain
I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I'm in you
Baby
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
Cause baby when I'm finished with ya you won't wanna go
Outside
And I'ma work you like a pro, baby
And, you gon' take it like one
Yeah you gon' take it like one
And I'ma give it like you asked for it
Why, 'cause you been talkin' 'bout it
I know you been talkin' 'bout it
Ooh baby when I'm done with you
You ain't sayin' nothin'
Yeah you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ooh baby when I'm done with you
You ain't sayin' nothin'
Yeah you ain't sayin' nothin'
You gon' make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ain't makin' no love
But I'll pretend
Oh girl, I'll pretend
If you pretend then girl I'll pretend
Let's make it seem like we're all we need in the end
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
Cause baby when I'm finished with ya you won't wanna go
Outside

Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes, cabbed all day
Took the bus back home, evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it, you're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin' 'specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke, you need more bread
Now you got no rent, you blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day, hipster nights downtown
And your daddy don't know you're out
If they don't let you in, you know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind, you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest
XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa
I love it when your eyes are red
Ah yeah, are you on my cloud yet?
'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV?
Oh why, I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess, you look so depressed
And you're filled with regret and you feel like you gotta go home
'Cause these nights pass so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for your face lift
Lust over love is your mindset
Waken up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party
If they won't let you in, you know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest
XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa
I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out, oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out, oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out, ooh
Just ride it

Oh yeah
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas, all this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low, my eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration (oh yeah)
For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you don't gotta check the sky
We been going all night, till light
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out
Work that back till I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO, [x8]

Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
And now I'm poppin' yeah
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot every time you hear me playin' in the club
You never thought that I would ever go this far
(Never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long
(You never thought it could last so long)
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
(I been alone for most of my life)
What makes you think that you can ever do me right
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

You can pick my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
'Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some choppers on the car
What kind of caps I got the finest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall
Mama I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
Where it goin', no telling
But to make room, I'll vanish
Call a friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexis
I let my niggas test it
I'm always worth a cent
Best believe I'm already spent
My blunt full of BC
My cup full of Texas
Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "who's next?"
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

She pop that pussy on a Monday, she never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she put in work
She wanna give me all her money, she used to spend it all alone
'Cause her man went and did her wrong, so she
But baby I'm not trying to be the one
I got my baby waiting home, she been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart and you can't pay to win my love

Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go, don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up, girl, I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind and expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected, girl you're such a masochist and I ask, "Why?"
And you reply
"I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie"

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this
Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good
Open your hand, take a glass

She give me sex in a handbag

And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it

Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me

The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things which you cannot explain"
And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition

She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love

She wants somebody to love

She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya
Right now I can't see straight
Intoxicated it's true
When I'm with you
I'm buzzing and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase
When I'm with you
Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
We be drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down
We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya
Right now I'm emotional
I lose control, when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you
Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
We be drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down
We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
(You put your drinks up)
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer

Can your heart be mine in search?
'Cause I have no time to help you find
All the words
Melodies and memories
Stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies
As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend
Please don't wait
I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you but I can't
As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend
I never doubted myself
But I doubted you
I'm tired of looking by myself
And not with you
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

Oh when I, in the same light
Show me in the same light
Feels right, come and take flight
Clothes off and she so soft
This ain't a fair fight, yeah
What a shared love
Only so dry
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters is never the question
She likes when I'm messy
And I like when she's undressing
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably gotta do mine
But it's gotta be the right time
We're only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor
Baby I'm a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you
But I can't be a teacher
'Cause I'm a problem with problems
I know who I am and I'm not no good
You can have me tonight and ever
I thought you understood
Baby some people are meant to be loved and others just naked
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
I don't, I don't really know
I don't, I don't really care
Maybe keep it on the low
With stories I don't wanna share
(Don't stop)
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
When you're looking like this
I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time 'cause it's gonna defeat me
But if you won't believe me, believe me
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again
'Cause I can't help myself
'Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
This love is tainted

She is the life of the party
Don't stick that knife in my body
It's something she always wanted
It's for a good cause
You're doing a good job
We're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean
You change what I see
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
Guilty for insanity
Not like a movie
Change the scene
Taste your sweet profanity
This is all for a good cause
Think you're doing a good job
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So let's cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(You were right on border)
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof
So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(You were right on border)
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(You were right on border)

My luck's on the game
Can't find a way through
Don't know how many times
I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene
This wasn't my dream
It was all yours
And of course
I got caught up in this game
And you know I won't say names
Of who's to blame
I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
My own mind was in the way
Front seat, new view
Don't know how many times
I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game
A game
I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
I tried
Hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all
Don't try to hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all up
I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth

I'm sipping pink
Lucozade
We're blazing on that new found haze
I'm seeing in the blacks and grays
I'm hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear
You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you
Your position
You'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution
And the only solution is making shit confusing
And it ain't about who's winning or losing
It's 'bout the path you're choosing
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
When the scars are gone you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me
Bulls eye you the dot to me
Emotions splattered, same pattern
Can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
I'm, tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
She's older, I told her
We ain't meant to be
It takes two not three, but I'm here any way
I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room
Disguise is your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me
Be there, you run to me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya
Kept runnin'
Outwit, 'cause you cunnin'
That outfit 'cause you stunnin'
Begging 'cause I'm losing mage
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain
The fuck is going on?
I think I got it wrong
When I told you I was over you, or were you under me?

I can taste it on your mouth
And I can't leave it
You're a freak like me
Can't you see?
We can work this something out
And I'm believin'
You get off on me
It's like cheating
I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Put you up against the wall
Don't take it easy
You like it hard like me
It's what you need
Let's get naked and explore
Our inner secrets
For what it is
It's what it is
I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on
I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on
I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when then take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

In the clouds where the angels sing
In your eyes, where I wanna be
And her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body
Needs me too
I need somebody to
Love me blue
I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long
In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah it's so glassy
In her eyes, where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body
She needs me too
I need somebody to love
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue

I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd
I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you
For the love in my mind
Love for the bass
She likes getting high just for the day
She's different in night, she knows what I say
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes
I don't know you
I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you...

Hey what's up, it's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up
While I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
It's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Talkin' don't want me, 'cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
It's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He can't love you like I would
He can't love you like I could
He don't know your body
He don't know your body
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
He can't touch you like I would
Won't touch you like I do
He can't love you like I could
Won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would

I, I need you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking what
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine
I, I want you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking why
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine
Should we wait till the morning?
See it loud in your eyes
Can't escape what I'm feeling
Your body on top of mine
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I want you
Your body on top of mine
I want you
Your body on top of mine

I smoke two joints before I play video games
Then I get 10,000 points
I flew around this planet only yesterday
Because I am an alien
I seen this galaxy and Milky Way
I even watched the sun
I got a J givin' me my light away
Because I don't get drunk
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late
Three more joints and I'm still playing video games
Can't even count the points
Play it 'til my fingers bleed
Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed?
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late
And then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you
And then we fly away and then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you and then we fly
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late

It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece
Seems to be incomplete
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright
Look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
'Cause it grows and it grows
And I hope that you know
'Cause it grows and it grows
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows

In the beginning
God created heaven and Earth
But for what it's worth
I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to
Every day
And every night

Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again
All over again
No, how can I get you all over my skin?

Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted

You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah

Baby you should touch me right there
You can take me right there
We can make it
Hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?

I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down, oh no
No I won't let you down, oh no
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down, oh no
No I won't let you down, oh no
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting to fifths
Biting your lip
Loving too late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah...)
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!)
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!)
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

3 AM and my neighbours hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time mary-jane won't save me
 
I've been working later
I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
Like poison coursing through me
So clear, my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind out it
 
I've been sleeping later
I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
(I want you all)
Say it before you run outta time
(I want you all)
Say it before it's too late
(I want you all)
Say what I am feeling, oh
(I want you all)
Waiting is insane
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

(One, one, one...)
Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it
'Cause I
(I got new, I got new, I got new...)
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(Oh, whoa-oh)
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I've gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't let him in, don't let him in
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
You're gettin' over him

All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
Not running away
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops
Then, darling, what will I do
And I know I go all in
But why do I
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over
That watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

Last night, my fantasies become oh-so true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'll be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know (know, know, know)
In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams
Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is a-ticking, we gotta leave now
Time is a-ticking, and we gotta leave town tonight
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know (know, know, know)
In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams
In my dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
In my dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
In my dreams, oh
In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams
Yeah
In my dreams
Yeah
In my dreams

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Now it's getting quiet here
Now it's getting blue
And this baby ain't no fair
Taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies
I've been thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes
The things that you do
I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love
Even though I found a way
I still come back
Know there's nothing more to say
It's all been said
I've been trying to explain
Nothing we hide
To all of my friends who say
That I've gone mad
I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore
And I need some new love, new love, new love
Easy come, easy go, why?
I've been living on, living on
Living on, give it all, give it all
Can't I just let it go?
'Cause I wait for a miracle
I wait for a miracle, yeah!
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You see that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up and run from the scene
When I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothing back
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
My eyes wide open, fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burning like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love

In the beginning
God created heaven and Earth
But for what it's worth
I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to
Every day
And every night

Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise

So sorry!

Yeah

And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is gettin' serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again
All over again
No, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition
Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go
I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise

I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothing back
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
My eyes wide open, fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burning like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
Like it's our last dance!
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers

And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting to fifths
Biting your lip
Loving too late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah...)
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!)
(And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!)
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind

Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign

And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign

Now it's getting quiet here
Now it's getting blue
And this baby ain't no fair
Taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies
I've been thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes
The things that you do
I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love
Even though I found a way
I still come back
Know there's nothing more to say
It's all been said
I've been trying to explain
Nothing we hide
To all of my friends who say
That I've gone mad
I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore
And I need some new love, new love, new love
Easy come, easy go, why?
I've been living on, living on
Living on, give it all, give it all
Can't I just let it go?
'Cause I wait for a miracle
I wait for a miracle, yeah!
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love

Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

3 AM and my neighbours hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time mary-jane won't save me
 
I've been working later
I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
Like poison coursing through me
So clear, my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind out it
 
I've been sleeping later
I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
(I want you all)
Say it before you run outta time
(I want you all)
Say it before it's too late
(I want you all)
Say what I am feeling, oh
(I want you all)
Waiting is insane
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman
Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm
Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)
Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't laugh, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
Let's get lost in the light, baby

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You see that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up and run from the scene
When I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?
So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hit my head against the wall
What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
CHORUS:
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Won't listen to any advice
Mom's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head
What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
(All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
So I got a question:
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, huh your drug?
Your drug, huh your drug
Huh your drug, is my love your drug?
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Hey! Hey!
So...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love...
...is my drug
I like your beard

Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they... 
When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild
And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around
And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
Oh!
There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh... 
Everybody take it off!
Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh...
Everybody take it off
Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Ohhh...woah
Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
(Oh...) Everybody take it off
There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on

Listen to yourself you're a hot mess
St-t-tutter through your words breaking a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess?
What we both know
Yeah, I was outta town last weekend
You were feeling like a pimp round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down
I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
Uh-oh-oh
You're looking like a tool and not a baller (baller)
You're acting like a chick why bother? (bother)
I can find someone way hotter
With a bigger, wow
Well
'Cause on top of all the ways that you messed up (messed up)
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut (mouth shut)
I'm so sick of it I've had enough
I hope you die
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh

Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know
I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell

Stephen
Stephen
Why won't you call me?
Stephen
Why won't you call me?
I saw you
In your tight ass rocker pants
You saw me too
I laughed
'Cause I was completely trashed
And I watched your ugly girlfriend
Sneered across the room
As if I really care
That she's here with you
All I know is
You're my object of affection
My drug of choice
My sick obsession
Stephen
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
(Call me)
I'm sitting here waiting
(Waiting)
Why won't you call me?
Stephen
(Stephen)
I'm feeling pathetic
(Feeling)
I can't take rejection
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
I've got guys
Waiting in a line
For me to play
My evil girly games
With all their minds
Just watch me
I've got it down
To a simple art
Just bat my eyes
Like this
And there's a broken heart
But somehow
You turn the tables
What the hell?
I can charm the pants off anyone else
But you
Stephen
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
(Call me)
I'm sitting here waiting
(Waiting)
Why won't you call me?
Stephen
(Stephen)
I'm feeling pathetic
(Feeling)
I can't take rejection
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
Stephen
I'm thinking that
Maybe
You might think I'm
Crazy
Is that why you won't
Call me?
Steve
Don't you think I'm
Pretty?
Do you not
Love me?
Is that why you won't call me?
'Cause you're my object of affection
My drug of choice
My sick obsession
I want to keep you as my pet to play with
And hide under my bed forever
Stephen
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
(Call me)
I'm sitting here waiting

Why won't you call me?

I'm feeling pathetic
(Feeling)
I can't take rejection
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
Stephen
I'll knit you a sweater
I want to wrap you up in my love
Forever
I would never let you go Stephen
I'll never let go
Stephen
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?
(Call me)
I'm sitting here waiting
(Waiting)
Why won't you call me?

(Stephen)
I'm feeling pathetic

Why won't you call me?

Ah
La, da, da
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Coming out your mouth with
Your blah, blah, blah
Zip your lips like a padlock, (Yeah)
And meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Boy, come on, give me rocks stuff
Come put a little love in my glove bag
(Yeah)
Wanna dance with no pants on?
(Holler)
Meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care
What my middle name is
I wanna be naked
And you're wasted
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
3OH!3:

You're always saying some shit (Sense)
You say I'm playin'?
I'm never laying the dick
Sayin' "Blah, blah, blah"
'Cause I don't care who you are
In this bar it only matters who I am
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (Oh!)
Blah, blah, blah
Stop talking
Stop ta-ta-talking that

And now the sun is rising
Now the long walk back home (back home)
There's just so many faces,
But no one I need to know (need to know)
In the dark I can fight it, I fight till I'm numb
But in the bright light,
I taste you on my tongue
Now the party's over
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?
Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you (like you)
And now my head is throbbing
Every song is out of tune
Just like you
In the dark I can fight till it disappears
But in the daylight
I taste you in my tears
And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?
Now I've got myself looking like a mess
Standing alone trying to pretend but no,
I put up my fight
But this is it this time (time)
'Cause I'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
I'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
Oh, oh
And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?
And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?
Ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

Bored, stoned, sitting in your basement
All alone, 'cause your little conversations
Got around, now lookie what we all found out
(Lookie what we found)
Lookie what we all found out
That you have got a set of loose lips
Twisting stories, all because you're jealous
Now I know exactly what you're all about

From other people with all of your lies
Wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth
(Shut your mouth, you never shut your mouth)

That you waste your breath talking about me
Got me feeling kinda special, really
This is what you're all about

Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)
Katie's to the left, repping my style
Damn, Jeanie, why you gotta tell the secrets 'bout my sex life?
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around
Pick you up, take you out
When your car broke down
(Back-back-backstabber)
(Stabber-Stabber)

Girl, you're such a backstabber (stabber, you're such a backstabber)

And everybody knows... (everybody knows it)
Everybody knows (back-back-backstabber),
You're looking like a lunatic
And everybody knows (back-back-backstabber),
Everybody knows

I think you got the best of me
You're sleepin' with the enemy
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, I'm so lone
My heart stops, I already know
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
Never gonna catch me cry
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die
Oh whoa whoa
Without me, you're nothing
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die
Oh whoa whoa
I've let go, finally over you
This drama that you put me through
I'm better all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, you're so lone
It's last call and it's gotten old
Now look who's all alone, alone, alone, alone
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
Never gonna catch me cry
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die
Oh whoa whoa
Without me, you're nothing
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die
Oh whoa whoa
I trusted you, you were the first
Then you lied and it gets worse
You broke me down
Now just look around
Who's all alone?
Who's all alone now?
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
Never gonna catch me cry
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die
Oh whoa whoa
Without me, you're nothing
Oh whoa whoa
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me till the day you die

Here we go, welcome to my funeral
Without you I don't even have a pulse
All alone it's dark and cold
With every move I die
Here I go, this is my confession oh
Lost cause, nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
With every move I die
I have destroyed our life, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all my fault
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die
I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die
When did I become such a hypocrite?
Double life, lies that you caught me in
Trust me I'm paying for it
With every move I die
On the floor I'm just a zombie
Who I am is not who I wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
With every move I die
I have destroyed our life, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all my fault
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die
I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die
Oh, this is it and now your really gone this time
Oh, never once thought I'd be in pieces left behind
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die
I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

(Boots, Boys)
I think it's time that I mention
I've got myself an obsession
For the smell, for the touch
I know I got myself a habit
But I've got to have it now

(Let me break it down)

I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
And I am, I am starstruck with every part
Of this whole story
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside, let it live and die
This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die
I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't want the concrete, I am alive
Comes with the tragic
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die
This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die

Rawr!
I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry
When you say you love me
Hush, if you know what's good for you
I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous
You're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter patter
I want your liver on a platter
Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner
Yep, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
Oh ooh whoa oh

It's making my brain delirious
I'm just talkin' truth
I'm telling you 'bout the shit we do
We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes, hard
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexified
So let's go-o-o
Let's go!
Tonight we're going har-har-har-ha-ha-hard
Just like the world is our-our-our-ou-ou-ours
We're tearin' it apar-par-par-pa-pa-part
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
We're dancing like we're dum-dum-du-du-du-dumb
Our bodies growin' num-num-nu-nu-nu-numb
We'll be forever youn-youn-yo-yo-yo-young
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
DJ, turn it up...
DJ, turn it up...

Tonight we're going har-har-har-ha-ha-hard

We're dancing like we're dum-dum-du-du-du-dumb
Our bodies growin' num-num-nu-nu-nu-numb
We'll be forever youn-youn-yo-yo-yo-young
You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
Ow!

Or your bougie friends.
I don't need love, looking like diamonds, looking like diamonds.

And I don't need love, looking like diamonds, looking like diamonds.

Or your bougie friends.
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds, looking like diamonds.
You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck I'm not givin' about you money and man servant at the mansion you live in.
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in.
Just grab a bottle, some boys and let's take it back to my basement and get Sleazy.
Sick of all your lines, So Cheesy!
Sorry daddy, but I'm not that easy!
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it.
I'ma take it back to where my man and my girls is.

Over to your place.
Rat tat tat tat on your dum dum drum.
The beat so phat, gonna make me cum, um, um, um...
Over to your place.
I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique.
But your money's not impressing me, it's kinda weak,
That you really think you're gonna get my rocks off,
Get my top and socks off,
By showing me them dolla's in your drop box.
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em.
We take the drinks from the table when you get up and leave 'em.
And I don't care if you stare, and you call us scummy,
'Cause we ain't after your affection.
And sure as hell not your money, honey.
I don't need you or your brand new Benz.

I miss your soft lips
I miss your white sheets
I miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
And this is so hard
'Cause I didn't see
That you were the love of my life
And it kills me
I see your face in
Strangers on the street
I still say your name when I'm talking in my sleep
And in the limelight
I play it off fine
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh
They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
Remember the time
We jumped the fence when
The Stones were playing and we were too broke to get in
You held my hand and
They made me cry while
I swore to God it was the best night of my life
Or when you took me
Across the world we
Promised that this would last forever but now I see
It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise
They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise
(Till the sun rise)
(Till the sun rise)
They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

I'm in love all right
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin' up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doing all right
Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the Sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh
Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life
I just hope some people see
There's nothing that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop all the shit talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here my running my mouth
Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the Sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh
Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life
Every single night we...
Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douche bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life
Oh oh oh

Last night I had enough of you
I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard
It was all over your face
That you were slippin' and flippin'
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man
But you are just a bitch
You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag
When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Yeah I think your hot
I think your all right
But your acting like
A chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When I first met you
Panties droppin'
Everytime I saw you
It was on and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's reason why I'm walkin'
If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you and you got confused
You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag
When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Yeah I think you're hot
I think your all right
But your acting like
A chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Oh
Grow a pear
You can call me back
And no I don't want to see your man-gina
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Yeah I think you're hot
I think your all right
But your acting like
A chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

I was looking lost, it was cold outside
The whiskey rocks how you caught my eye
My red lips painted, just got them black
I needed something to bring me back
You knew the play and we danced all night
But something wasn't right
So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
You won't call and you won't admit
The lies you spin for your power trip
And I just can't take you seriously
When all you send is a text to me
So I'll be gone when the morning comes
Let's not pretend it's love
So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
I don't want anything from this
I got your number, don't call me I'll call you if I need a hit
Oh
So I'll see you next Tuesday
(I'll see you next Tuesday)
So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
(Know you have a girlfriend, Yeah I know you have a girlfriend)
So I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Tuesday...
Oh oh, oh oh
Tuesday...
I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh
Tuesday...
I'll see you next Tuesday...

I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
And I am, I am starstruck with every part
Of this whole story
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside, let it live and die
This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die
I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't want the concrete, I am alive
Comes with the tragic
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die

Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us
Don't stop, make it pop

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay
I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world
Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly
I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there,
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything
So how can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful
If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful

It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"
Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my
Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"
Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my
A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I
I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"
And he says:
Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:
Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"

And I wrote down our song

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

DJ:
Hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?
Tim McGraw:
I have heard this song.
DJ:
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?
Tim:
It was awesome. Uh, except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.
DJ:
*Laughs*
Tim:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don't know if it's true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.
DJ:
Why don't we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?
Taylor:
Oh it's definitely a compliment. Yeah.
*Laughs*
DJ:
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.
Tim:
Nice-
Taylor:
Nice to meet you.
Tim:
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?
Taylor:
I'm doing great. How are you doing?
Tim:
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record! It's doing great.
Taylor:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker. 
*Laughs*
DJ:
Well-
Taylor:
The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.
*Laughs*
Tim:
Well I'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.
DJ:
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked?
Tim:
No.
DJ:
You haven't met?
Tim:
No.
Taylor:
No, we've never talked or met or anything.
Tim:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.
Taylor:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.
Tim:
They didn't? Okay well, there ya go. I did.
*Laughs*
DJ:
So I-I
Taylor:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.
Tim:
Not at all.
DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "Tim McGraw" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?
Taylor:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.
Tim:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-
Taylor:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?
Tim:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.
Taylor:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.
Tim:
I agree.
DJ:
This, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?
Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...
*Laughs*
Taylor:
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.
Tim:
Now I feel old.
Taylor:
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.
Tim:
Aww, thank you.
Taylor:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out all right. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"
*Laughs*
Taylor:
"And I'm like "well..."
Tim:
Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.
*Laughs*
Taylor:
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.
Tim:
All right, great.
*Laughs*
Tim:
Well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.
Taylor:
Awesome, it's been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?
Tim:
Um I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.
*Laughs*
Taylor:
Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.
Tim:
Ya do? What would-
Taylor:
Yeah.
Tim:
What would their name be?
Taylor:
Uh, um I think Taylor something.
Tim:
Something like that yeah.
Taylor:
But-
Tim:
Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.
Taylor:
Just consider it.
DJ:
Ah, well that's very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.
Tim:
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.
DJ:
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.
Tim:
Absolutely.
DJ:
Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.
Taylor:
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you Tim.
Tim:
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.
Taylor:
Bye
Tim:
Good luck out there.
Taylor:
Thanks

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Merry Christmas" - I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
A crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl under cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special
And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Please take down the mistleoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing all right if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyon's got someone to hold
But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everynbody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases whe I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Halleluia!
Halleluia!
Halleluia!
Christ the savior is born

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
Tell me what you would find
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I'd think there was somethingwe all forgot
What would happenif presents all went away
Tell me what would you find
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes
I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight 'cause I - I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where...
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be you're everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes... beautiful eyes

It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no
You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment, now capture it, remember it
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We all like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass won't catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
I'd wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I'm here
And the night is mine
So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn't wait till I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to breathe
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I'm Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
My mother said don't forget where you come from, where you've been
Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
They keep you grounded
Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten
Oh but never were there truer words
And I'll my days I've ever heard
And when she told me little girl the answer is love
So those are words that I keep with me
Though the seasons change so quickly
Keep them buried in my heart
And never fought
So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn't wait till I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I'm Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
I been goin' on, I been growin' up
I'm a know it all, I don't know enough
See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough
Guess I'll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn't wait till I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I'm Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)

Run, run like the devil's behinds us
Run to where no one can find us
Be my accomplice to my crime
Oh baby
Run, run 'cause we're guilty as sin
Run 'cause we know we won't win
We know together we kill time
You'll never face a judge without me
You'll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I'll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you...
We'll be Outlaws
We'll take on the world
We'll be Outlaws
Run, run like you never did
'Cause they found the evidence
And they found your fingerprints
All on me and baby run
Run like your life depends on it
Let's make forever in this moment
Tell me you love me again, Oh again
And I would waste away without you
You're the shine into my star
I'd be searching till I found you
Wherever you are... You are
We'll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We'll take on the world together
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde
We'll be Outlaws
You and me
They'll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
You'll never face a judge without me
You'll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then I'll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time
With you...
Oh with you
W-i-t-h you
With you
We'll be Outlaws
Partners in crime
We'd take on the world together
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde
We'll be Outlaws
You and me
They'll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
We'll be Outlaws...

Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I'm beautiful
'Cause I wasn't looking for love no
Nobody asked to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasn't trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today
'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
I'm mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What's wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, oh
And I wasn't trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay
'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming till I see you again
I'm not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm
Falling again
Falling again
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours

I grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing
I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it
Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?
Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid
I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it
Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from "when boredom strikes" to "Ms. Star on the Rise"
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man
Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

To me, 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.
Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us
We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be all right
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my, we'll be just fine
Don't mind us, yeah
Find me where the wild things are
There's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it.

So much on my mind
I think I think too much
Read between these lines
Unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side
It blurs
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our name
Oh nothing's sure but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Oh steady me
Be my source of gravity
While me world's unraveling
Say you'll never change
Oh oh
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down, down
I'm trying not to take too much
I'm in over my head
Over love, boy I over trust
Give me the chance to pick up the pieces you left me in
Why did I let you in?
Overzealous, I'm over this
Oh I'm over us
Over and over
I let you under my skin and it's over
I promise never again you'd come over
Something takes over me
I can't control this hallucinogen
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
We fight, we laugh
Detox, rehab
Letting go of what we had
Oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Over trying
Over lies
Over crying
Over-traumatized
Over-worked and moreover I'm done
Over and over
I'm falling under your spell, call me over
I'm runnin' back to this hell you come over
And didn't you say we were through?
Why can't I get over you?
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Boy I come crashing, crashing
Down from the high and wondering, wondering
Wondering why this ain't over
Let it just be over
Sobering thoughts taking over my mind
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Knock on my door, boy come home
You stay in my head
Lay in my arms, why won't you?
It's been way too long
What you waiting on?
'Cause I've been laying here
Learning what the memories won't do
See I need you and baby I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart
We could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...
Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around
Why don't you?
Till the end of time
Say that you'll be mine
An uphill climb fighting what the heart
Really wants to do
See I need you
And sometimes we need to
Shed our facade and be just who we are
All broken and torn, then we could be stars
Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...
Piercing lights in the dark
Make the galaxy ours
Kingdom right where we are
Shining bright as a morning
You'll never be lonely
Just promise you'll love me
I'm never too far
And we'll never part
And we could be stars
Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...
Just find way to get home
There's a space in my heart
Open arms for you to run to
Baby close your eyes and take the leap
To make believe in fairytales
I'll meet you there
Oh yeah, I'll fall too
See I've wanted you here
All along but my fear
Just keeps haunting me won't let me go
So it's hard to say I love you
We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I could go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)

Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears
I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had
I can't pretend that I don't miss you
Every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears
Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between time
The meantime that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
"Don't deviate, " they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
'Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
So I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious desire
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
'Cause my song will live on beyond time
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Pulling out inside pink socks
Sorry 'cause I'm already home
I'll get rid of this on my own, oh
Dropping stuff I'm in my car

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating disco?
Well it was the mid 70's
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And um, I was conducting various sonic experiments
With the assistance of Mary, my wife
Anyway, during one session I discovered
That by using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
And that was the night I created disco
I created
Disco (x8)
Disco (x8)
Disco (x8)

Inside me,
Inside me is a flame,
That burns brighter any time you came.
Gets in the way, when I'm alone with you,
But disappears if I'm with someone new,
It learned how to fit into my foreplay,
With my skills our love was going okay.
Until the night when we were on the phone,
You're moving on and want better.
Ow!
Uh, oh yeah.
Uh, oh

I think about it every night.
I've been in fashion from the start.

She's the type of girl that makes you feel better
It don't matter how you used to feel
She's the kind of girl that follows good weather
And the sun brings out her sex appeal
If you want to talk to her it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh I bet that you can hear the rain
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be all right
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be all right
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be all right
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be all right
How do you think I could make you feel better?
How do I know what you say is real?
Like did an imaginary love letter
Talking mostly 'bout her sex appeal
If you want to talk to her it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh I bet that you can hear the rain
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be all right

"Counterfeit, counterfeit" that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And amicably lick the blood stain from your finger, say "what do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be (you want it to be)
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends "get out the way"
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, yeah
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Coming back, coming back, to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight you fall out of view (you fall out of view)
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends "get out the way"
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, yeah
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

I've got to stop waiting for you
And move onto someone new
But everything around me is blue
The colour that reminds me of you
I've got to stop looking back
My head can get lost off track
And I know that you're not comin' back
But Lord I wish you would now
I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop bought
I'm looking happy, but I'm not, no I'm not, no my baby
I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop bought
I'm looking happy, but I'm not, no, no, no-o
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
I've got to stop waiting for you

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year
God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

I'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away, without a second glance
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, Whoa!
Why can't I realize I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, Whoa!
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2
This is like a flashback

Must be the worst day of my life
Izza kizza
Girl
My first mistake was ltting you into my life (Yes it was)
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed (Laying in my bed)
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Oh, I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you,
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that our heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
See yesterday I called her back
The day before I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago I did my thang
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow I thought we could chill
There won't be, yes, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see Cupid he wilL stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said take two, and he said call me in the morning
It's the worst day
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side (My life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
My life

Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
Relax
Relax
Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back
Relax
I've got the coat and the jackets to match
We can replace everything that you lack
Take a book and a nicotine patch
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
Relax
Relax
Relax
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not god forsaking
And that's worth celebrating
Relax

And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today.
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I look twice at your girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame
But now suddenly, I don't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you
It's not good for me, I can't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today.
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm looking twice at your girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends
Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends (x4)

Stop bein' a bad joke
It's not the same
Feeling that sunshine
And forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful
Without the rain
Your life's got happy
You got on the TV
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Being with each other
We're havin' fun
I've got time to spare so
I might find the one
We dig each other
And break the rules
We love one another
And that's no fool
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
I take a piece of paper
And write your name
You put it in your pocket
And I did the same
We love each other
And that's for sure
I live here without you
I can't take it no more
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Miss Perfect sitting at the train stop,
Red Nike high-tops, listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting, started conversating
Before I got her name, along came a train (oh)
Oh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Oh!
Oh!
Now I'm lookin'...
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
(Ciki-ciki)
On the street, kickin' rocks,
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush,
Checking every corner shop,
Tappin' people's shoulders, askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same, it's back to the train
Oh!
Oh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Oh!
Oh!
I'm still lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold,
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn,
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again,
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder, if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do,
Somewhere in Brooklyn

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever, 
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted 
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes 
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

Somewhere far away

My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had
You're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
Oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah, ah, ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh oh oh oh oh

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue, beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you never do the same
No, no, no, no

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face

Bruno Mars
Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer, that's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way to the top
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
I take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got
'Cause 68 cents just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out until they call the cops
'Cause my job's got me goin' nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
I take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
Damian 'Jr.Gong' Marley
Here comes Junior Gong
I'm flying high like superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't if it's just because
Pinapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to da bigger heads because de whole a dem a saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem (fly make no drop)
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap
Bruno Mars
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever, 
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted 
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes 
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Bruno Mars &amp; Cee-Lo Green
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

Lupe Fiasco
First rule, never let 'em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
And they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be
Bruno Mars
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, do I look okay, I say
When I see your face, there is not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, hey
Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfects what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
When I see your face, there is not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
Lupe Fiasco
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great only silicon will bill it
A botox to kill it
You just killin' off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors
Bruno Mars
The way you are, the way you are
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, yeah

She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Miss Perfect sitting at the train stop,
Red Nike high-tops, listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting, started conversating
Before I got her name, along came a train (oh)
Oh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Oh!
Oh!
Now I'm lookin'...
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
(Ciki-ciki)
On the street, kickin' rocks,
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush,
Checking every corner shop,
Tappin' people's shoulders, askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same, it's back to the train
Oh!
Oh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Oh!
Oh!
I'm still lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold,
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn,
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again,
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder, if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do,
Somewhere in Brooklyn

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had
You're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
Oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah, ah, ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile

'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue, beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you never do the same
No, no, no, no

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby

You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side

We've been hanging out all night
Everything's been so nice
Wish I didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
'Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
[ Lyrics from:
Take me the long way home

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there

I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl that girl
Every time I came around
She made her body go down
Her physical was so crazy
She could make a blind man see
Ooh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl, that girl
I must've seen her beauty at the bar
Under the strobe lights, looking like a star
(Looking like a star, girl)
But everyone started rushing me
Looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Club closing up, I'm still looking for you
Walked up to the ladies room
No luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth
Next thing I know
She tell my show, "This ain't you
Looking at you, you wanna take me home
So tonight, I just might put you on"
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night

What are you fucking crazy?
Damn ...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see,
That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I...
I do not wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it,
'Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.
I'm already lost.
I wish that I could see,
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned.
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
Do you notice me,
I need to know right now
'Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
'Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous,
Should you have by now noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!
Girl, I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.

Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away
Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up
Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away
Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up
Dim all the light sweet honey
'Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
'Cause it's for eternity
Love don't come easy
This you know I understand
I want to be your woman
If you'll be my man
Let yourself go freely and I'll
Show you things that you've dreamed of
Don't think that your dreaming
We've found the perfect love
And I'm like a cup
So fill me up
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
'Cause the night is on the way, oh baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away
Do what you want
You can use me all up
Take me bottom to top
Don't leave even one drop
No, no, no
Do it tonight
You know the moments are right
Turn my brown body white
Come on, dim all the lights
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
'Cause the night is on the way, hey baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away, hey baby
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
Dim all the lights sweet honey...

Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words can say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years have passed and were stil here today
Never ...in my dreams did I think
That is woluld happen to me
As I stand here before my woman ...
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I'm must have done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life.
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flys when you're in love
It took us a life time to find eachother
It was worth the wait caus I fuinally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen
To me
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes.
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must have done something right.
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life.

Ah ah I don't know why why
It seems like every other night you pick a fight fight
And I know I do the same
Be calling you out your name
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do
You tell me to go I start walking out
We both know what we're all about
We first fight and scream but it's all because of love
But we ain't never giving up
Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out work it out
Talk it out talk it out
Stick it out stick it out ooh
Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around
Before you say say
Something you know you'll take back later on today
Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you babe
All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me
You tell me to go I start walking out
We both know what we're all about
We first fight and scream but it's all because of love
But we ain't never giving up
Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out work it out
Talk it out talk it out
Stick it out stick it out ooh
Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around
Ain't nobody that could love me
Like you love me
That's why I always turn around
For you you y-you you you...
Ain't nobody that could love me
Like you love me
That's why I always turn around
For you you y-you you you...
Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out work it out
Talk it out talk it out
Stick it out stick it out ooh
Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out
That's why I always turn around

I spent all my money
On a big old fancy car
For these bright eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up till the sun is high
Till the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (you make a mess of me)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (you make a mess of me)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
You, you
You, you, you
Yeah you, you, you
You, you, you
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (you make a mess of me)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well, I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (yeah)
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (yeah)
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
It looked alright in the pictures (yeah)
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it? (yeah)
I fall apart with all my heart (yeah)
And you could watch from your window (yeah)
And you can watch from your window
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets, I'd like it if you stayed
Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets, I'd like it if you stayed
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets, I'd like it if you stayed
And I like you
And I like you
And I like you

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
Oh, oh, oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Oh, oh, oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
The minds we had, the minds we had
How all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
Moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
The minds we had, the minds we had
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em
You're the only friend I need
(You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids
(Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
(And laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough
(But that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need
(You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids
(Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
(And laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough
(But that will never be enough)
(But that will never be enough)
(But that will never be enough)
(But that will never be enough)
(But that will never be enough)

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay)
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good
And I'll never go home again
Place the call, feel it start
Favourite friend
And nothing's wrong when nothing's true
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
And I'll breathe, and it goes
Play along
Make believe it's hyper-real
But I live in a hologram with you
Cola with the burnt out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
And I'll never go home again
Place the call, feel it start
Favourite friend
And nothing's wrong when nothing's true
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
And I'll breathe, and it goes
Play along
Make believe it's hyper-real
But I live in a hologram with you

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your greatness
And she'll send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well, ah
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I'm kind of over getting told
To throw my hands up in the air
So there
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I'm kind of over getting told
To throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kinda older than I was
When I revelled without a care
So there
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean
And the cry goes out (Haahaah)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Haahaah)
And now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us
And the cry goes out (Haahaah)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Haahaah)
And now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious
No-one 'round here's good
At keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up
When we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess
We're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready
When the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed
Words in my brain
Secretly you love this
Do you even wanna go free?
Let me in the ring
I'll show you what that big word means
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious

Today is my birthday and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything
I'm not, in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels but I think that'll change
Still like hotels and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title
Held by everyone who's up
All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business, all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah
All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business, all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah
Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
Now, I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business, all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day 
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it, then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers 
Fill the dashboard just the same ah, a ah
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this, when we're
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
(And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
(Everything works out so good)
I'll let you in on something big
(I wear the robe like no one could)
I am not a white teeth teen
(Everything works out so good)
I tried to join but never did
(I wear the robe like no one could)
The way they are, the way they seem
(Everything works out so good)
Is something else, it's in the blood
(I wear the robe like no one could)
Their molars blinking like the lights
(Everything works out so good)
In the underpass where we all sit
(I wear the robe like no one could)
And do nothing and love it
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
We got the glow in our mouths
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out

That slow burn wait, while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb
We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks
When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone
We're all alone, we're all alone
I know we're not everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
(When people are talking, people are talking)
(When people are talking, people are talking)
Get still
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people and schemes
(When people are talking, people are talking)
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
(When people are talking, people are talking)
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
(When people are talking, people are talking)
We're all alone, we're alone
(When people are talking, people are talking)
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk

We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
I forget the mallets from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder
Now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
To like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the D-talk groan and the locker room where we stayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing me
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you, my heart jumps around
When I'm alluded to, this will not do
'Cause I was raised up to be admired
To be noticed, but when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing to assault
When all eyes are on you, this will not do
I'm faking glory, lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on and the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, woah
And I can tell you that when the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me
But I learned not to want the quiet of a room
With no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, woah
And I can tell you that when the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me
But I learned not to want the quiet of a room
With no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go

There's nothing I want but money and time 
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick 
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives 
A limit in spite will do the trick trick trick trick 
We can leave the house, lead the party, let the people know 
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go 
There's nothing as fun as coming untied 
And running with the kids in the park park park park 
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go 
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark 
We can leave the house, leave the party, let the people know 
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go 
It's not about just being out with the right people 
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw 
And now I'm letting you know 
And now I'm letting you know 
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

I'm in a clique but I want out 
It's not the same as when I was punched 
In the old days there was enough 
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood 
I was in but I want out 
My mother's love is choking me 
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free 
Be a part of the love club 
Everything will glow for you 
You'll get punched for the love club 
For the love club 
I joined the club and it's all on 
There are fights for being my best friend 
And the girls get their claws out 
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids 
Take the pill make it too ill 
The other day I forgot my old address 
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want 
Except to be alone 
Be a part of the love club 
Everything will glow for you 
You'll get punched for the love club 
For the love club 
Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go 
So drop your chin and take yourself back home 
And roll out your maps and papers 
Find out your hiding places again 
The only problem that I got with the club 
Is how you've severed from the people who watched you grow up 
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again 
They will be waiting at the end 
Be a part of the love club 
Everything will glow for you 
You'll get punched for the love club 
For the love club

It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
Skip a hit, don't make a sound 
(It feels better biting down) 
Breathed so deep, I thought I'd drown 
(It feels better biting down) 
Listen to the beats resound 
(It feels better biting down) 
It feels better biting down 
(It feels better biting down) 
(It feels better biting down) 
(It feels better biting down)
Skip a hit, don't make a sound 
(It feels better biting down) 
Breathed so deep, I thought I'd drown 
(It feels better biting down) 
Listen to the beats resound 
It feels better biting down 
It feels better biting down 
The electronics of your heart 
See how fast they fall apart 
(It feels better biting down) 
The electronics of your heart 
See how fast they fall apart 
(It feels better biting down) 
(It feels better biting down) 
Skip a hit, don't make a sound 
(It feels better biting down)

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line
Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
Those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you
All those rumors, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Oh god I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move along with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see every
Ribbon you used to tie yourself to me
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
Ah ha
King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
Oh God I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor ware
Limelight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive
When they get dark
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
Ah ha
King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
Midnight, we're fading
Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
Oh, dancing with us, oh, dancing with us
(Can you feel it, can you, can you)
Dancing with us, us
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you get to my high (limelight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (limelight, lose my mind)

A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Our thing progresses
I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships
To sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest
They'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares - still the Louvre
Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it
Supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it

One, two
Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone
The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone
They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun

(Go back and tell it)
Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh
I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh
Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah
"What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape"
Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess what? I like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers
We're L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S.
Generation
L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S.
Generation
All fuckin' with our lover's heads
Generation
Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess what? I like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers
We're L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S.
Generation
L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S. (look out, lovers)
Generation
All fuckin' with our lover's heads

You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when
I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes, cleaning up
The champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
And the terror
And the horror
When we wonder why we bother
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother
All the glamour and the trauma and the fuckin'
Melodrama
All the gun fights
And the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

Break the news-you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
I am my mother's child, I'll love you till my breathing stops
I'll love you till you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch
But it's just a supercut of us
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

I'm a liability
I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no no no no...
Whatcha gonna do?
All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you
And... and all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing woo-hoo-hoo
Maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
Maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently
But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability)
But you're not what you thought you were
(Reach me)
But you're not what you thought you were
(You leave)

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' you where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Sends us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night
'Cause all of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Sends us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

I can't help myself but think of what you've done for me
Day or night it seems that you are always on my mind
And I know whenever I need you near
I always feel that you will be there right by my side

You'll never leave me, because I know
That you are the one for me
You're the one who moves me

I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me
Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land machine
Who said I can't wear my Converse with my dress
Well baby, that's just me
Who said I can't be single and have to go out and mingle
Baby, that's not me... No No
Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land
Tell me do you feel the way I feel,
Cause nothing else is real in the La La Land appeal
Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well everything's the same in the La La Land machine
Well I'm not gonna change in the La La Land machine
I will stay the same in the La La Land
Machine, Machine, Machine
I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)

Don't walk away like you always do
This time
Baby you're the only thing
That's been on my mind
Ever since you left
I've been a mess
(You won't answer your phone)
I'll say it once
And I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know
I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring
And I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing like we used to
Oh, kiss (or hold) me like you mean it
Like you miss me 'caus I know that you do
I wanna get back get back
With you
Don't look at me that way
I see it in your eyes
Don't worry about me I've been fine

Since you left
And every time I see you
It gets more And more intense
I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring

You fled from medication 
'Cause it only causes pain
You won't go to the doctor
He keeps calling you insane
You're lost even when
You're going the right way
You mean the world to me
Even though you might be crazy
And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
But now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
Made me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed
No, yeah
I shook your hand
And you pulled it right away, yeah
You asked me to dance
And instead I said no way
Inside I was dying to give it a try
And you begged me so I stayed
I knew you were different
From the way I caved
And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
But now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
You make me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed
Yeah, ooh, no, yeah
We were so different
But opposites attract
So my hope kept growing
And I never looked back
You're one of a kind
No one can change this heart of mine
And you said we wouldn't make it
But look how far we've come
For so long my heart was breaking
And now it's standing strong
The things you'd say
You make me fall harder each day
You're a trainwreck
But I wouldn't love you if you changed
Oh, ooh, ooh, yeah
One more thing I thought
I'd share with someone special
I'm falling like I've never felt before
It's funny, you said we'd never make it
And look how far we've come
You're a trainwreck but with you
I'm in love

I saw you lookin' over
Now I see you movin' this way
Pushin' through the crowd
Like you got something to say, yeah
But you couldn't walk
Cause the music's taken over your feet
I could tell by your toes
That you're rockin' to this beat
You gotta dance till you ache
Till you drop, till you break
Free your soul let me see you shake
One by one we're stealing the stage
Here we come, so get out of our way
It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud, Yeah
I know your type
And all the hype is goin' straight to your head
And everybody's stoppin' what their doin'
Cause your face is turnin' red, yeah
Gotta learn how to move to the grove
Give in, or get out
Put your hands in the air
Stand up in your chair and shout
You're all dolled up with nowhere to go
You wanna get out and put on a show
There's nothin' wrong with stayin' home
As long as you've got your radio
It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it
Don't wait, and don't ya be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud
Come on!
Dallas, Texas,
Bring it home for me baby!
The little things that you do
From across the room
I see you're sending me clues
They're in the way you make me move
It won't be long till the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it
Don't wait, and don't ya be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
And scream it out loud
Scream it out loud
Get your, get your party on
Let's do it again!

Didn't wanna say I'm sorry
For breaking us apart
I didn't wanna say It was my fault
Even though I knew it was
I didn't wanna call you back
'Cause I knew that I was wrong
Yeah, I knew I was wrong
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call
No need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight
We'll leave it on the line
Listen baby,
Never would've said forever
If we knew it ends so fast
Why did you say I love you
If you knew that it wouldn't last?
Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying
The line is breaking up
Or is that just us?
Or is that just us?
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call
No need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight
We'll leave it on the line
I try to call again, I get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread
Apologies are often open ended
But this was better left unsaid
One in the same
Never to change
Our love was beautiful
We got it all
Destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call
No need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight
We'll leave it on the line
We'll leave it on the line
Yeah, oh yeah
We'll leave it on the line, tonight

Did you forget
That I was even alive
Did you forget
Everything we ever had
Did you forget
Did you forget
About me
Did you regret (did you regret)
Ever standing by my side
Did you forget (did you forget)
What we were feeling inside
Now I'm left to forget
About us
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it
So now I guess
This is where we have to stand
Did you regret
Ever holding my hand
Never again
Please don't forget
Don't forget
We had it all
We were just about to fall
Even more in love
Than we were before
I won't forget
I won't forget
About us
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it
Somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it
At all
And at last
All the pictures have been burned
And all the past
Is just a lesson that we've learned
I won't forget
Please don't forget us
Somewhere we went wrong
Our love is like a song
But you won't sing along
You've forgotten
About us
Don't forget

You reeled me in with your smile
You made me melt with your voice
Now, I've been gone now for a while
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice
And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it be best if you get lost,
'Cause we know you'll never change
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught
You promise me all of your time
I guess I'm not the only one
But see, it's my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one, or gone
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had your shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught
Go and try to get me back
(You won't get me back,
You won't get me back)
Don't forget about our past
(I won't forget, no)
Never had the guts to leave,
Now you're making it
(So much easier)
You know you're making it
Now you're making it
You're making it
Much easier for me to see
Don't say that your sorry
For breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start
Now it's time to get lost
And don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head,
'Cause you're wasting your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play 'cause you had you shot
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught
You better stop messing around,
'Cause you're gonna get caught

She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone
To show her who she could be
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
But I needed you to believe
You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da da da da
She was scared of it all
Watching from far away
She was given a role
Never knew just when to play
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the thrown
But you've given me strength to find hope
You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
She was scared, unprepared
Left in the dark, falling apart
I can survive with you by my side
We're gonna be all right (we're gonna be all right)
This is what happens when two worlds collide
You had your dreams I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da da da da
You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
Showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
When two different worlds collide

Knew where I was going when you left the room
You're the kinda guy who makes me wanna follow through to you
I've been trying to leave here for the longest time
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my ride by
I like it, I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it, I like it
I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
I like it, I like it, I like it
And I like it, I like it, I like it
Losing my direction, that's the way it should be
Feeling a connection when you're standing next to me
I wanna be rolling, I just wanna be rolling with you
All of the things you say (I like it, I like it)
They're taking me far away (And I like it)
I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
Maybe you'll save me
You're gonna take me from this crazy
I've been waiting
'Cause I just need a little, I just need a little
Somewhere in the middle with you
Crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Of something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Something's making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
Crash, fall, I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you
Crash, fall, I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you, middle with you

My state of mind has finally got the best of me 
I need you next to me 
I'll try to find 
A way that I can get to you 
Just wanna get to you 
The world I see is perfect now 
You're all around 
With you I can breath 
Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine, mine 
Alone inside I can only hear your voice 
Ringing through the noise 
I can't find my mind, keeps on coming back to you 
Always back to you 
Wanting something out of reach, it's killing me 
You're all I see, yeah 
Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine, mine 
Just stop wondering 
If we were meant to be 
Forget about waiting, just hold me 
I'm ready to begin 
The waiting has to end 
Right now, today 
I've got to find a way, yeah 
Mine 
Until you're mine 
Until you're mine 
I have to find a way to fill this hole inside 
I can't survive without you here by my side 
Until you're mine 
Not gonna be even close to complete 
I won't rest until you're mine 
My state of mind has finally got the best of me 
I need you next to me

I'm losing myself
Trying to compete
With everyone else
Instead of just being me
Don't know where to turn
I've been stuck in this routine
I need to change my ways
Instead of always being weak
I don't wanna be afraid
I wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see, I just wanna believe in me
La la la la
La la la la
The mirror can lie
It doesn't show you what's inside
And it, it can tell you you're full of life
It's amazing what you can hide
Just by putting on a smile
I don't wanna be afraid
I wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see, I just wanna believe in me
I'm quickly finding out
I'm not about to break down, not today
I guess I always knew
That I had all the strength to make it through
Not gonna be afraid
I'm gonna wake up feeling beautiful today
And know that I'm okay
'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
You see now, now I believe in me
Now I believe in me

What did I do to deserve this?
Tell me the truth and don't lie
You're pretty good at that but, no not this time
You walk around like you run the world
Running your mouth, and talking about me now,
They think that you're the perfect girl,
They're gonna see everything so get back
It's gonna come back around
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this again
You just too adverse but I have got news
You know you're just gonna lose
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.

I'm feeling bad for,
You are alone and nobody cares that you are
One look into your eyes,
Easy to see what you could be but you're not
I say it's time that you give in,
Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over
You feel your heart beat deep down
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain,
Just get out
It's gonna come back around
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this again
You just too adverse but I got news
You know you're just gonna lose
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.
You keep hearing everything that people say
And you can't take the pain another day

It's coming back around
I told you this town was just too small
You're just too adverse but you can stop now
'Cause it's gonna come back around
And around and around and around and around
Yeah yeah

It's gonna come back around
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong (Too strong)
To take this, take this again [Whoa]
You're just too adverse but I've got news
You know you're just gonna lose
Everything and everyone that means so much to you
Everything and everyone that means so much to you
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.

And I feel, I feel a deep connection,
And I think, that we might be onto something, no
And I know it's something special,
Seeing you here, is not coincidental, mh
Well, I've been walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines,
And I've been fighting, fighting, from the other side,
I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time",
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines.
Oh, oh
See, I was trying to be everything you weren't expecting,
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing,
Now I'm falling way too fast,
I just want this love to last, forever (forever)
Everytime I feel this way
Oh, something's changed for the better
And I've been walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines,
And I've been fightin, fighting, from the other side,
And I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time",
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines
Now I'm walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines,
And now I'm fightin' (fighting) from the other side,
And I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time",
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines

I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
And ignore all your messages
I tell everyone we are through
'Cause I'm so much better without you
But it's just another pretty lie
'Cause I break down
Every time you come around, oh, oh
So how do you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You'd think that by now I know
'Cause here we go, go, go again
You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Every time that you look at me
You only hear a half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye
But it's no use
Can't be with or without you, oh, oh
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I know
'Cause here we go, go, go again
And again, and again, and again
I threw all of your stuff away
And I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I know
Cause here we go, go
Here we go again, here we go again
Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Again, again, again, again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again

You speak to me
And in your words I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see
What's wrong for me
I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if you're gonna get away with this
You're not sorry
I can't believe I fell for this
I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo, solo
You sing to me
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key
If your life is such a mystery
Why don't you just stick to acting?
Here we go again
You couldn't even find my number until when
You thought that you could get to my best friend
Without a script your game is lacking
I can't believe I fell for this
I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me
Here's what you've won
Got me planning to go solo, solo
I'd rather go to a party alone
Than have to walk around with you on my arm
Now that I'm proud to admit that we're done
Good luck trying to find me...
'Cause I didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me is what you've won
Got me planning to go solo
Now we're done
'Cause you've got me planning to go solo, solo
Solo, solo

(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
Summer came it took me by surprise
A California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down
We sing along to our favorite songs
Nothing could go wrong
Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything
Could tear us apart
Then you break my heart
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
Goodbye
Caught you from the corner of my eye
You smiled at a girl while passing by
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
I know what's going on
It didn't take me long
Wasn't hard to read between the lines
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine
Nothing I would give, do, or say
Now I'm on my way
Now it's too late
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should of known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
To broken promises
Time to face your carelessness
Don't fool me with apologies
And by crawling on your knees
You got nothin' on me
(You got nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me
I know who you are
Now I see I should have known it from the start
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see, I should have known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
Goodbye

I'm standing in the center of the room
I watch the boys follow girls perfume
All is as it should be I assume
Except for the distance between me and you
You're standing as a flower on the wall
The room is still but we're about to fall
And all the names that brought us here
Simply fade away
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I can't believe that night turned into today
I used the line you were supposed to say
And all the names that brought us here
Now we have to thank
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are has got me on my knees
(Who you are has got me on my knees)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
If you are I will wait I will follow
I'm here to stay
As long as we're promised tomorrow
I'll wait
Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me
Who you are has got me on my knees
(Who you are has got me on my knees)
I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
I'm hoping
I'm waiting 
I'm praying you are the one
You are the one

I hear what you're not saying
It's driving me crazy
It's like we stopped breathing in this room
We're both the last to be leaving
I know what you're thinking
I wish you'd make you move
It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally
It's like you know where I'm going
You follow me home but
I never invite you inside
I see what you're not showing
I've got you alone but
The air is so still, it's weird
It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally
Don't stop, don't stop
Telling me goodnight
Just promise you'll kiss me goodbye
What's taking so long?
Don't tell me you're not gonna try
The tension's building in my mind
I wanna scream and I know why
It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally
Make it all go away
It's so quiet in here

Before I fall
Too fast
Kiss me quick
But make it last
So I can see
How badly this will hurt me
When you say goodbye
Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass
And don't let go
But tonight
I could fall too soon
To this beautiful moonlight
But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me
See this heart
Won't settle down
Like a child running
Scared from a clown
I'm terrified
Of what you'd do
My stomach screams
Just when I look at you
Run far away
So I can breathe
Even though you're
Far from suffocating me
I can't set my hopes too high
Cause every hello ends with a
Goodbye
But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
But please don't catch me
So now you see
Why I'm scared
I can't open up my heart
Without a care
But here I go
It's what I feel
And for the first time in my
Life I know it's real
But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me
If this is love please don't break me
I'm giving up so
Just catch me

Now you told me on a Sunday that it wasn't gonna work
I tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out
I knew what you were thinking before you'd say it aloud
Don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not even breaking
You're not worth the time that this is taking
I knew better than to let you break my heart
The soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
Every time you lie, every time you lie
I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place
Less trashier, much classier than who you proved to be
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me?
I knew better than to let you break my heart
The soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars, oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
At night, awake, I will be sleeping till morning breaks
That's the price you pay for your mistakes, goodbye to dreaming
So don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not gonna listen
I knew better than to let you break my heart
The soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars, oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
Oh, every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry, oh
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie

I can't take your hand and lead you to the water
I can't make you feel what you don't feel but you know you wanna
Find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me
Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know
And you might feel like you're drowning 
But that's what I need to let go
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses
Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Got dynamite?
I can't paint this picture just so you can hang it
I can't wait for you to understand if you just don't get it
Find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me
Underneath the surface 
There's so much you need to know
And you might feel that you're drowning
But that's what I need to let go
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses
Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
When the walls come crashing down
I hope you're standing right in front of me
Where my past lies all around me
'Cause all you need to save me is to intervene
And make the walls come crashing down
Got, got dynamite?
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses
Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite 
Got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite?

Oh, woah, oh
I don't know why, I don't know why I'm so afraid
And I don't know how, I don't know how to fix the pain
We're livin' a lie, livin' a lie this needs to change
We're out of time, we're out of time and it's still the same
We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone
I'm hearing the noise, hearing the noise from all around
And I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge of breakin' down
Like Bonnie and Clyde, let's find a ride and ditch this town
To keep it alive, keep it alive, don't make a sound
We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone
I never wanna take that final look
I'll turn another page, won't close the book
We can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
You said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
But I'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone
Let us be alone, let us be alone

You've got a face for a smile, you know
A shame you waste it
When you're breaking me slowly, but I've
Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through
I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye
And that's when I know I've
Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through
Oh, I'm going my own way
My faith has lost its strength again
And oh, it's been too hard to say
We're falling off the edge again
We're at an end
We're at an end
Maybe you'll call me someday
Hear, the operator say the numbers no good
And that she had
A world of chances, for you
She had a world of chances, for you
She had a world of chances
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through
Chances you were burning through
Oh
You've got a face for a smile, you know

I feel a separation coming on 
'Cause I know you want to be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight 
You pull me in, avoid a fight 
'Cause I feel a separation coming on 
Just prove that there is nothing left to try 
'Cause the truth that rather we just both deny
You kiss me with those open eyes 
It says so much, it's no surprise to you 
But I've got something left to say 
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then, now you're listening
To what they say, don't go that way 
Remember, remember December, please remember
Don't surrender
You said you wouldn't let them change your mind 
'Cause when we're together fire melts the ice  
Our hearts are both on overdrive 
Come with me, let's run tonight
Don't let these memories get left behind 
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December 
We were so in love back then, now you're listening
To what they say, don't go that way
Remember, remember December, please remember 
I remember us together
With a promise of forever 
We could do this, fight the pressure 
Please remember December 
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember, remember December 
We were so in love back then, now you're listening 
To what they say, don't go that way 
Remember, remember December, please remember 
Don't surrender

I've been bruised and I've been broken
Can't believe that I put up with all this pain
I've been used and I was choking
On the promise, I would never fall again, mm
I used to sing to your twisted symphony
The weights that had me trapped inside your misery
But now I know the reason why I couldn't breathe
'Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
'Cause all I really, all I really want is everything you're not
Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
(Everything you're not, not, not)
Never wanna feel this way again
Your darkness was my weakness
But it turns out that it only went so deep, deep
A meaningless diversion
That is all that you ever meant to me, me, me, me
And I am done with your twisted symphony
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe
'Cause all I want I everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
'Cause all I really, all I really want is everything you're not
Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen
I need respect, I need love, nothing in between
I will not spell it out for you if you can't see
'Cause you're not worth it, you don't deserve me
And now I'm gone...
Everything you're not, not, not
Everything you're not, not, not
1, 2, 3!
'Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, don't care what you say
All I really, all I really want is everything you're not
Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh
Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh
Never gonna break my heart again
Never gonna see your face again
Never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh

Sometimes you think you'll be find by yourself
Cause a dream is a wish you make all alone
It's easy to feel like you don't need help
But it's harder to walk on your own
You'll change inside
When you, realize
The world comes to life
And everything's all right
From beginning to end
When you have a friend
By your side
That helps you to find
The beauty of all
When you'll open your heart and
Believe in
The gift of a friend
The gift of a friend
Someone who knows when your lost and your scared
There through the highs and the lows
Someone you can count on, someone who cares
Besides you where ever you go
You'll change inside
When you, realize
The world comes to life
And everything's all right
From beginning to end
When you have a friend
By your side
That helps you to find
The beauty of all
When you'll open your heart and
Believe in
The gift of a friend
And when the hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground
You, you'll feel all alone
When you don't know which way to go
And there's no such leading you on
You're not alone
The world comes to life
And everything's all right
From beginning to end
When you have a friend
By your side
That helps you to find
The beauty of all
When you'll open your heart and
Believe in
When you believe in
You can believe in, the gift from a friend

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live (then we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears?
So far away and now I just need you here
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live (and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road (there's no road)
To get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you 
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle 
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy

The tooth under your pillow case
No I won't I won't
Ever have let you down? (no)

You know why
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby
We're big enough
To stand in the picture
We're big enough
To stand next to love
I was a player
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart breaker
When I was little
But now I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger
Love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoaa
Remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed close
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby
We're big enough
To stand in the picture
We're big enough
To stand next to love
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger

A heart breaker when I was little
But now I'm bigger

I swear they look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger
Love bigger

Cause we're bigger
Love bigger

Don't knock you earrings, like yesterday
They shine on me
We were little then
In class daydreamed about you ooooohhohh
Just remember you ooooohhohh
Since then all I can remember is the love
Falling down

We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)
So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)
So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it to me)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya
Above ya
Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong (belong)
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya

Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh
Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, oh
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here (here, here, yeahhh)
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?  (do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'

Ludacris
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Oh
Yeah
Mmmm
I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
Cause baby
You smile I smile (oh)
Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile (oh whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey
Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby (hey)
You smile, I smile (whoa hey)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug (last hug, last hug)
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality (reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand
And I understand that it's meant to be
'Cause baby when you're with me
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (like you took me to heaven girl)
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)
Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance

'Cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

Not feelin', no pain, no fear (no fear, no fear)

But but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong

Never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover

One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall
With me
Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take you and leave the world with one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth

One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Oh oh
Oh ohhh
Oh oh
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart
So we fight
Through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh
Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa
So far away and now I just need you here
So we'll fight
Through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh
We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

Oh
Yeah
Mmmm
I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile ohhh
You smile, I smile oh
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say yeah
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile, I smile oh
And whenever you smile, I smile oh
Baby take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile whoa
You smile, I smile oh
And whenever you smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile oh
Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Whenever you smile, I smile whoa
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
And whenever you smile, I smile
When you smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space, and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know

Justin Bieber
Never say never
(never, ever)
Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh
And there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny
I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him
Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!
I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)
Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never (never say it, never say it)
Say never (okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
never, never, say never
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never

Uh... uh...
Yeah...
I, I do not trust 
So I cannot love
Can't no man be trusted?
Oh, no, no, no
And I, I would not dare 
To open up
This life of yours is dusted, Pink
Well, my rent's past due 
And now my car won't start
I hate the bus
Aren't you glad you have somebody to talk to?
Tell me what do they see 
When they look at me?
Do they see my many 
Personalities?
Oh, oh, no
Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is my reality
Oh, oh
Can it be my turn now?
Is it my turn, Pink?
Said: "I'll say it again
You're my only friend"
I protect you from the world
I basically protect you from yourself
Though I can't go on
I'm not satisfied
With this being the end
This is just the beginning
Tell me, why can't I just reach up 
And simply touch the sky?
Tell me, why can't I spread my arms 
And fly and fly and fly?
Tell me, why can't I say this?
Why can't I do that?
Tell me, what do they want from me?
Tell me how to act
Said: 
"Can you help me?"
"Does anybody hear me?"
"Can they even see me?"
"This is my reality"
Oh, oh
Can you help me?
(Can you help me)
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
(Oh...)
This is my reality 
Oh, oh
So I'm putting it 
All on the table
You don't know me 
Well enough to label me 
Sick or even disturbed
When you break it down
I'm just two girls
Trying to blend
Trying to vibe
Trying to live 
Just one life
Everybody's got insanitites
I got a split personality
Tell me, why can't I just reach up 
And simply touch the sky?
Why can't you?
Tell me, why can't I spread my arms 
And fly and fly and fly?
You can
Tell me, why can't I say this?
Why can't I do that?
Tell me, what do they want from me?
Tell me how to act
Oh...
Can you help me?
I can't
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
(Can they?)
This is my reality
Oh, oh
Can you help me?
(Oh...)
Does anybody hear me?
(Can they?)
Can they even see me?
(Do they want to help me?)
This is my reality 
Oh, no, no
Oh, oh
Won't you help me?
(Can you help me)
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
(Can they, can they)
This is my reality 
Oh, oh
Talk to me
Can you help me?
Talk to me, darling
Do you hear me?
Do you see me?
Yeah, it's mine 
Oh, calm down
It's all mine
It's not that serious
It's my reality
It will be just fine
It's just too much for me
Oh...
You're my friend
Oh... 
You're my friend
Oh...
Pink
Pink

So you know that I'm pissed
They say you're faithful
I don't believe that shit
Oh no, oh no
Oh, I tried 
To act like I don't care
But it doesn't seem fair
You're so good to her
And I tried 
To pretend I don't see
All these things that you do
You couldn't do for me
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna 
Treat me right
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna
Treat me right
Now you got another 
Girl in your life
(Another girl)
Giving her love 
All day, all night
(All night)
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna
Treat me right
So I hear
I met the wench before
Yeah, I remember that time
We went to Pizza Hut
And you told me 
She was your cousin

You learned to open doors
When did you become 
Such a damn gentleman?
Oh I tried 
(I tried)
To act like I don't care
But it doesn't seem fair
You're so good to her
(So good)
And I tried 
To pretend I don't see
All these things that you do
You couldn't do for me

I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna 
Treat me right
(Didn't wanna treat me right)
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna
Treat me right
Now you got another 
Girl in your life
Giving her love 
All day, all night
(All day, all night)
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna
Treat me right
What does she do to you
To make you give her everything
Like you never did for me
Call it jealousy
But it's killing me
'Cause all that time
When you were mine
You didn't treat me right
No, no, no 
You didn't treat me right
No, no, no
Oh...
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya

(Treat me right)
(All day and night)
I was in love wit ya
But to hell wit ya
'Cause you didn't wanna
I was in love wit ya

I never cared too much for love,
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want.
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game.
Couldn't be more fly,
Gettin' paid was everything.
But I'm not every girl.
And I don't need that world
To validate me.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing,
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love.
(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha. Ah... ah..)
Uh...
I was a girl about the floss;
It was all about the cost,
How much he spent on me.
Seek for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings,
It's what every fly girl
Could want or even dream.
But I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart.
No, oh.
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing,
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love.
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love...
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Yeah...)
(Oh, yeah...)
I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me, no.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent,
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...
But I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.
No, shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent,
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...
Oh, no.
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing,
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love...
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love...

Please don't come around talkin' bout that you love me,
Cause that love shit just ain't for me,
I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games,
Don't you know that game peeps game?
So your best bet is to be straight with me
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk I'll walk, yeah it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay
There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' 'bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' 'bout you miss me so,
That you love me so, Why I let you go?
There you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!
Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed
How you said goodbye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from 'round you,
Cause my life was all about you
So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah it's like that
Had your chance, won't take it back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
And When I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay
There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' 'bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' 'bout you miss me so,
That you love me so, Why I let you go?
There you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!
Ooh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?
Don't you wish that you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that?
Didn't miss a good thing till it's gone,
But I knew it wouldn't be long
Till you came running back, missing my love THERE YOU GO!
There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' 'bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' 'bout you miss me so,
That you love me so, Why I let you go?
There you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!

They make me sick
I know I feel you
That's why we need to stick together
Yep, yep, yep
I know
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip I'm feeling it I gotta get a grip
And its, driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You make me sick
He was doin' 8 0 on the freeway
In the 6 double 0 bumpin Isley
He was gettin' kinda close kinda touch-ay
Guess, he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he wanna go home
With me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he'd keep it all on the low-low
But I told him "Boo, I don't really know though"
He got closer to me... it started gettin' deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Hell of a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick
So hot 'n' the 6 now, so hot
Had to roll all the windows down
Isley got me thinkin' 'bout the sheets now
Wonderin should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
I'm thinkin', how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
All his slick ass lines were kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak... his body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get out the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
He was to smooth to be screamin my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this...
Can't... no no no no no no
Oh, you make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it... hatin' it... hatin' it

(One... and two)
Ooh
(Baby)
Dear baby, I'm not sorry
For leaving you this way
But I know I should have
Told you face to face
We've always been straight up,
So I won't waste your time
I'm leaving, say goodbye
Because I know what
You did last night
Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Let me let you know
I don't know where I'm going,
But I'm going far from here
Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Yeah, oh yeah
One more thing before I go
I hope you feel alone
'Cause I'm definitely tired of
Waiting for you to come home
(Been waiting for you at home)
We've always been straight up,
So I'll just take what's mine
I'm leaving, say goodbye
Because you hurt me
For the last time
Chorus (repeat)
Whatever your excuse is
I'm sure I've heard
Them all before
Time and time again
I told you that I needed more
Now I'm walking out the door
Chorus (repeat)

Love is such a crazy thing
I never thought I'd find someone
But you came along and made me see
That you were the only one for me
Boy, I love you constantly
You are my love
My only love
Baby, my heart belongs to you
Be with me
Don't play with me
If you want love just let me know
Love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel
Is it love for real
Love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel
Is it love for real
I dreamed of someone like you before
But I never thought I'd get the chance
To romance someone as sweet as you
I hope you feel the same as I do
You are my love
My only love
Baby, my heart belongs to you
Be with me
Don't play with me
If you want love just let me know
Love, love is such a crazy thing
Never understood the way, I was supposed to feel
Is it love for real...

Silly you, silly me
To let you in and put a move on me
(Put a move on me)
Never once asked for love
Always took it for what it's worth, memory
See I don't wanna be on a lonely street
Where the talk is cheap
And the price is sweet
I'm not that girl
I'm not that girl
And you don't wanna see the other side of me
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free
Before you fall too deep
Don't fall too deep
He don't know
I'm gon be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa
He's all talk
Thinks he knows
How this game is supposed to go for everyone
Still it seems he can't see
Thinks he's just using me, using me
See I don't wanna be on a lonely street
Where the talk is cheap
And the price is sweet
I'm not that girl
I'm not that girl
And you don't wanna see the other side of me
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free
Before you fall too deep
Don't fall too deep
He don't know
I'm gon be the one who's gonna let him go
Even if he wants to stay
I'll let him go
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa

Instead I let him go
All he wants from me is a private show, whoa

I ain't looking for a steady thing
I ain't looking for what love brings
I'm still young and I ain't ready babe
I'm still looking for some better days
I don't want to give you everything
I just want to make you feel things
If you ain't down to give me everything
Just throw it away
Don't assume 'cause I'm a woman that I'll fall in love
Don't expect I'm young and need to be took care of
Don't wanna hear you've got what I need
Cause how would you know before we speak
You've got to understand my side
I've had a crazy, crazy life
Nobody came along to open up my eyes
You better take what you can get
Don't even bother with my heart
If I get a feeling I won't let it start
I ain't looking for a steady thing
I ain't looking for what love brings
I'm still young and I ain't ready babe
I'm still looking for some better days
I don't want to give you everything
I just want to make you feel things
If you ain't down to give me everything
Just throw it away
Please believe me I've been down this road and back again
Learned a lesson and it was that love is not a friend
The day I put my trust in you
Will be the day I say 'I do'
Don't expect me just to open up
Maybe I'm just a little scared
Please don't tell me what you think I wanna hear
Oh baby save it I've heard it all before
There ain't nothing you could say
Oh to make me change my mind
I ain't looking for a steady thing
I ain't looking for what love brings
I'm still young and I ain't ready babe
I'm still looking for some better days
I don't want to give you everything
I just want to make you feel things
If you ain't down to give me everything
Just throw it away
So stop falling
Stop falling
You know you're falling, for me.
Stop falling
Stop falling.
Stop falling, for me
You've got to understand my side
I've had a crazy, crazy life
Nobody came along to open up my eyes
Oh baby, take what you can get
Don't even bother with my heart
If I get a feeling I won't let it start
I ain't looking for a steady thing
I ain't looking for what love brings
I'm still young and I ain't ready babe
I'm still looking for some better days
I don't want to give you everything
I just want to make you feel things
If you ain't down to give me everything
Just throw it away
Stop falling, mmmmm... yeah...

I like that though
That's what's up
Some people like the summer when it's hot
Some people like the winter cold
Some people speak their minds when they wanna
And some other people ain't so bold
Whatever it is that you do
You should do you should do with your head held high
So when you're doing you're thing it's cause you wanna
And they never can ask you why
1 I say
Do what you do
Say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
'Cause it's your life
Gotta make your own rules
And you gotta do it, do it your own way
Repeat 1
2 - Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Some like it easy when others they like it rough

But ain't nobody gotta like it but you
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy
Whatever, you should do what you do
How can they tell you that you could or should?
Would or wouldn't
Well ask 'em can they walk in your shoes
'Cause it's your life and you do what you wanna
And remember baby it's all about you
Repeat 1 (2x)
Repeat 2
3 - So if it's on your mind
Then you should speak your piece
And say what'cha say
And if you want it done
Then you should get it done
And do it your way
Repeat 3
Repeat 1 (2x)
Repeat 2 (2x)
Repeat 1 till end

Why every time I try to tell
You how I feel
It's like a hiccup cup-cup
It just won't come, come
Soon as I think I'm 'bout to share my loving
That's when
The hiccups come in
You're like a cough on a rainy day
You know the kind that gives you chest pains, yeah
And just as things start to feel ok
Then here you come to bring the rain
You hold me hard and you squeeze me tight
You let me go then you pick a fight
You make me wanna scream, cry, and shout out loud
Boy you got me spinning round and round
My thoughts,
They kinda shaky [kinda shaky]
Everytime I get around you,
Sweet baby
Sometimes, I don't know what I'm trying to say
Just tell me baby, tell me things are gonna be ok
I, I get all choked up inside, [inside]
And I don't know what to say [don't know what to say]
Sometimes I wanna just run and hide [no]
But you just stand in my way [why]
Vamp (x2)
Why every time I tell you how I feel
It's like a hiccup-cup-cup,
And you know the deal
Pink don't think before she speaks,
But you got me
Feelin', feelin', feelin', kinda weak

Is it love, or just a curse
Do you feel good when I hurt?
I need your heart to open up
If this love's not real
Then it's just my luck
Mommy help me, I need your help
This little boy took my love,
He says these things
That make my body bump up,
But then he runs
Leaving me undone,
And I don't understand
For sex he said he'd be my man
Daddy listen, I gave it up
I'm not your little girl,
My cherry's popped
And all the trust, is missing,
But please listen
What do I do
I know you wanna hurt him,
But I like what he do
He's only doing what you used to
You never told me 'bout
The birds and the bees
Or 'bout hide and go seek
Or what he gets when he finds me
The biggest mistake
Are the choices I make
Won't you help me decide
What's going on in my mind
Vamp
That thing you put on me,
It's got me so confused
Won't somebody help me,
Tell me what should I do
Why's it feel so good
Is it just a curse
Will it get better, or will it get worse?!?!?
Tell me,
Tell me,
Tell me,
Does it feel good?damn!
Ad libs

Please don't come around talkin' bout that you love me,
Cause that love shit just ain't for me,
I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games,
Don't you know that game peeps game?
So your best bet is to be straight with me
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk I'll walk, yeah it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay
There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' 'bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' 'bout you miss me so,
That you love me so, Why I let you go?
There you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!
Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed
How you said goodbye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from 'round you,
Cause my life was all about you
So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah it's like that
Had your chance, won't take it back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
And When I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games

Look at you, there you go!

I never cared too much for love,
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want.
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game.
Couldn't be more fly,
Gettin' paid was everything.
But I'm not every girl.
And I don't need that world
To validate me.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing,
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
Most girls want a man
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love.
(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha. Ah... ah..)
Uh...
I was a girl about the floss;
It was all about the cost,
How much he spent on me.
Seek for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings,
It's what every fly girl
Could want or even dream.
But I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart.
No, oh.
Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing,
Got the ching-ching.

I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me, no.
'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent,
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...
But I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.
No, shorty got a job,

Everything I want I always do

Always on the wrong track
But are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?
There's a song I was listening to up all night
There's a voice I am hearin' saying "It's all right"
When I'm happy and I'm sad but everything's good
It's not that complicated I'm just missundaztood
There might be a day everything, it goes my way
Can't you think I know I'm super fly? (heh-heh!)
I might see a world, in a world inside of you
Then I just might say "goodbye"
And it's my name, I know
I say it loud, 'cause I'm really proud
Of all the things I used to do
'Cause it's the wrong track
Looking for the right track
And are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?
Yeah yeah (uh..)
Looking for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But are you catching all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you?
There's a song I was listenin' to up all night
There's a voice I am hearin' saying "It's all right"
I was taken for granted but it's all good

Pink: what? (laughs) no this ain't damn exlax commercial,
This my first SINGLE MAN!

Never win first place,
I don't support the team,
I can't take direction and my socks are never clean.
Teachers dated me
My parents hated me
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothin' right
Every day I fought a war against the mirror,
I can't take the person starin' back at me.
I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more,
I wanna be somebody else
I wanna be somebody else, yeah
L.A. told me,
"You'll be a pop star.
All you have to change
Is everything you are"
Tired of being compared
To damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty,
That just ain't me
So doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin'?
A day in the life of someone else
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me (no)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating (no).
Don't wanna be my friend no more

Don't let me get me.
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself (yourself)
So irritating (so irritating). 
Don't wanna be my friend no more (don't, don't)
I wanna be somebody else
Don't let me get me (don't let, don't let) 
I'm my own worst enemy (don't let me get me),
It's bad when you annoy yourself (it's bad, it's so bad).
So irritating (oh)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (I)
I wanna be somebody else. 
(Don't let me get me, don't let me get me)
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself.

I'm lying here on the floor
Where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here
What have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here
Where I can run
Just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
I haven't moved from the spot
Where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here
Where I can run
Just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me (ill)
Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch (Just like a pill)
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch (Just like a pill)
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch (Just like a pill)
I think I'll get out of here
Where I can run as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You're making me ill
You keep making me
Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
(You making me ill)
Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes-Benz

I can go for miles if you know what I mean
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says 'Stunner, #1 Superstar'
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up you better)
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
Get this party started
Makin' my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancin' and they're dancin' for me

This is my rap song
1-2-3-4
I'm gettin' really sick and tired
Of these boys up in my face
Pick-up lines like what's your sign?
Won't get you anyplace
When me and all my girls
Go walking down the street
It seems we can't go anywhere
Without a car that goes beep, beep :::BEEP BEEP:::
'Cause this body is a priceless piece
Of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?
Hey ladies, yeah?
Let 'em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Let's come together
Hey Sistas, yeah?
Its time to be greedy
Nothin' good comes for free (nothin' good comes for free)
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Damn, I sure look fine
I can't blame those horny boys
I'd would make me mine
When I pass you in a club
"Ooh la la," you gasp
Back up boy, I ain't your toy
Or your piece of ass!
'Cause this body is a priceless piece
Of lovin' unconditionally, yes
So Mr. Bigstuff, who you think you are?
You was thinkin' you's gon' git it for free?
No no no
Hey ladies, yeah?
Let 'em know it ain't easy
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

Hey Sistas, yeah?
Its time to be greedy
Nothin' good comes for free X2
Nothin' good comes for free
No jealousy, no envy girls
Come on let's work it out
No freebies in the limousine

Give it up, he won't call you
Respect is just a minimum
Go on girl and get you some

You gotta let 'em know
That it ain't easy street, no

Hey hey man, what's your problem
I see you try hurt me bad
Don't know what your up against
Maybe you should reconsider
Come up with another plan
'Cause you know I'm not that kinda girl
That'll lay there 'n' let you come first
You can push me out the window
I'll just get back up
You can run over me wit your 18 wheeler truck
And I won't give a f***!
You can hang me like slave
I'll go underground
You can run over me wit your 18 wheeler but
You can't keep me down
Hey hey girl, are you ready for today
You got you shield and sword
'Cause it's time to play the games
You are beautiful even though you're not for sure
Don't let him pull you by the skirt
You're gonna get your feelins hurt
Everywhere that I go
There's someone waitin' to chain me
Everything that I say
There's someone tryin' to short change me
I am only this way
Because of what you have made me
And I'm not gonna break
Chorus X 3 (fade)

Momma please stop cryin, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breakin as I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said
You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growin' up in World War three
Never knowin' what love could be, you'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave
Daddy please stop yellin', I can't stand the sound
Make mama stop cryin', 'cause I need you around
My mama she loves you, no matter what she says its true
I know that she hurts you, but remember I love you, too
I ran away today, ran from the noise, ran away
Don't wanna go back to that place, but don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growin' up in World War three
Never knowin' what love could be, well I've seen
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything)
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
Let's play pretend act and like it comes so naturally
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Turn around please
Remember that the night you left?
You took my shining star
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Don't leave us here alone
Mom will be nicer
I'll be so much better
I'll tell my brother
Oh, I won't spill the milk at dinner
I'll be so much better,
I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night

Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh misery
I sure could use some company
Since you've been gone, I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause such misery
Oh, misery
Oh, misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery
And oh, I've been down this road before
Where the passion it turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught up again
But ain't it true, it takes what it takes
And sometimes we get too smart too late
One more heartache for me
Another night in misery
Oh, misery
Oh, misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Misery
Misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery
Misery
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery

Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know willl keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I know you'll keep them
This is what I've done
I've been a bad, bad girl
For so long
I don't know how to change,
What went wrong
Daddy's little girl
When he went away
What did it teach me?
That love leaves, yeah yeah
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know will keep them, yeah
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I know you'll keep them
So, this is what I've done
I've been down every road you could go
I've made some bad choices, as you know
Seems I've got this whole world cradled in my hands
But it's just like me not to understand, yeah
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know willl keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I've been a bad, bad girl
I've learned my lessons, yeah
I turned myself around
I've got a guardian angel tattooed on my shoulder
She's been watching over me
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know will keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause your the only one
That I know you'll keep them
This is what I've done
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
'Cause you're the only one
That I know will keep them
Dear, Dear Diary
I wanna tell my secrets
I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been a bad, bad girl

I'm an opportunity and I knock so softly
Sometimes I get loud when I wish everybody'd just
Get off me
So many players you'd think I was a ball game
Its every man for themselves, there are no
Team mates
This life gets lonely when everybody wants
Something
They'll smile up in your face
But they'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there
Surrounded by familiar faces without names
None of them know me or want to share my pain
And they only wish to bask in my light, then fade
Away
To win my love, to them a game
To watch me live my life in vain
When all is done and the glitter fades, fades
Away
They'll get theirs eventually
And I hope I'm there
I drank your poison 'cause you told me its wine
Shame on you if you fooled me once
Shame on me if you fooled me twice
I didn't know the price
You'll get yours eventually
So what good am I to you if I can't be broken?
You'll get yours, yes you'll get yours
Eventually

I can remember
The very first time I cried
How I wiped my eyes
And buried the pain inside
All of my memories
Good and bad that's passed
Didn't even take the time to realize
Staring at the cracks in the walls
'Cause I'm waiting for it all
To come to an end
Still I curl up right under the bed
'Cause it's takin' over my head
All over again
Do you even know who you are?
I guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
Lying awake
Watching the sunlight
How the birds will sing
As I count the rings around my eyes
Constantly pushing
The world I know aside
I don't even feel the pain
I don't even want to try
I'm looking for a way to become
The person that I dreamt up
When I was 16
Oh, nothing is ever enough
Ooh, baby it ain't enough
For what it may seem
Do you even know who you are?
I'm still trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Everybody wants to be...
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No
Sorry girl
Tell a tale for me
'Cause I'm wondering
How you really feel
I'm a lonely girl
I'll tell a tale for you
'Cause I'm just trying to make
All my dreams come true
Do you even know who you are?
Oh yeah, yeah
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
I guess not, oh, I guess not
Do you even know who you are?
Oh, I'm trying to find
A rising dream, or a falling star?
Oh, I have all these dreams
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
Oh, no, no
-Fades-
Do you even know who you are?
A rising dream, or a falling star?
Is life good to you, or is it bad?

No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend
I was too deep can't let you call me just jump in
At times I would push my feelings aside to let you feel
I'm novocaine I'm numb and nothing's real
Like the coldest winter
I am frozen from you
I was weak before now you've made me
So numb I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb
But the tears were silent inside, you see
But the tears were silent inside, you see
I laid there quiet
And watched you have your way with me
I might have cried 
But the tears were silent inside, you see
You called me names
Made me feel like I was dumb
I didn't feel a thing
And now I'm gone, gone, gone
Like a battered child
I got used to your pain but you know it's 'cause  
I was weak before now you've made me
So numb I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb (x4)

Goin' to California,
To live in the summer sun
The streets are made of silver
I'm like a rabbit on the run
Philadelphia freedom
Well, it's not like you have heard
The city of brotherly love is full of pain and hurt
Goin' to California
To find my pot of gold
Corruption on every corner
Hustlers selling sweets
Baby is home crying
While her momma's on the street
Everybody's dying
Have you heard the news today?
A woman in north philly is mourning
The bullet took another son away
I'm goin' to California
I'm going far, far away
I'm going to California; yes
To resurrect my soul
The sun is always shining
Or at least that's what I'm told
Going to California
There's a better life for me
Goin' to California
I'll write and tell you what I see
Goin' to California
Somebody say a prayer for me

Daddy was a soldier,
He taught me about freedom,
Peace and all the great things,
That we can take advantage of.
Once I fed the homeless
I'll never forget
The look upon their faces as I
Treated them with respect
This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score
Mama was a lunatic
She liked to push my buttons
She said I wasn't good enough
But I guess I wasn't trying
Never liked school that much
They tried to teach me better
But I just wasn't hearing it
Because I thought I was already pretty clever
What do you expect from me
What am I not giving you
What could I do for you
To make me okay in your eyes
Chorus: This is my vietnam
I'm at war
They keep on droppin' bombs
And I keep score

I've been depending on the overgrown
Too many lovers that I'll never know
Counting my losses as I let them go
Heavy the water as I sink below
Down down deep down
Down deep down
Down down deep down
Oh won't you be my livewire?
Make me feel like I'm set on fire
Your love will take me higher and higher
Oh won't you be my livewire?
I've been pretending all my shots are blown
Cover my heart up never let it show
I'm shaking it off to find a higher low
So heavy the water
Oh so heavy the water falling
Down down deep down
Down deep down
Down down deep down
Can you hear me falling
Down down deep down
Down deep down
Down down deep down
Oh won't you be my livewire?
Make me feel like I'm set on fire
Your love will take me higher and higher
Oh won't you be my livewire?
So hold me when I fall away from the lines
When I'm losing it all, when I'm wasting the light
And hold me when I put my heart in your hands
When I'm losing it all, when I'm wasting it all
Oh won't you be my livewire?
Make me feel like I'm set on fire
Your love will take me higher and higher
Oh won't you be my livewire?

Before you came 'round, my heart would never beat much faster
Before you came 'round, I was ready to slow down
Before you came 'round, I was heading for a small disaster
Before you came 'round, I was ready to blow me down
Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Before I was found, I felt like I could drain the ocean
Before I was found, I didn't want to breathe out
Now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder
A love with no doubt, and now I'm never gonna slow down
Never gonna slow down
Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
On the ground, on the ground, on the ground
Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Lay down your slow
Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down
And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat
Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down
And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking, on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat (Falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (We're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (Found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat

Sat back with the window down
Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights
But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there's a place I'd rather be
And I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me
Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
See, I remember all the times you made me covered in crazy
I can't forget about the way you played me
Like I was never gonna change your world
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
Loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
All I do, all I do
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you

Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones
Loose up we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three
And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Your name I'll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three
And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?
And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a space and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

I know it hurts sometimes but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
But you'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I know your hope is heavy but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
And I know you feel like everything
Is falling to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
'Cause I know you'll get over it
So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
You fell down by the wayside
Love locked in an overflow
And you threw stones at the starlight
'Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you
That I get that you're lonely
And I see that you feel alone
But I heard in a heartbeat
I'll be there for you, you know
So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
And every time that you're lonely
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me

Step out into the sun
Skies above they radiate me
Lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been out of my mind
This slow life I'm waiting for you
To swing me all of your line
Do you know?
Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
I find getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lies
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights
'Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
Step out into the dark
Where were you when I was trying
To lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been closing my eyes
Love me slow, hallucinating
Swinging me all of your light
Do you know?
Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
I find getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lies
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights
'Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
Hold me close when it's over
Life goes slow loving sober
Feel my bones getting older
Sadness grows when you're cold
'Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high
Hold it steady with you by my side
One step heavy and two steps high
Two steps high
'Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Ever since the rain I've been waking on my own
Left an empty space in a home we built to grow
Watching waves at night I fell into the blue
I guess I lost the light, now I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my, given all my love to you, you
Ever since the rain I've been living days too slow
Lie around and wait for a heart I used to know
They say that over time there'll be nothing left to lose
But I still can't find the light, I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my, given all my love to you, you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my, given all my love to you, you
In the night when I'm dreaming
Oh I know your body's next to mine
In the dark I can feel it
Don't you tell me I'm dreaming
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me? Oh-oh
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay?
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my, given all my love to you, you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my love to you
I've given all my, given all my love to you, you

You got diamonds in your eyes tonight
Throwing fire, trying to make it right
You're getting higher than the ceiling lights
And falling hard enough to lose the fight
Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose
Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money
There's a human in your heart of hearts
Hiding true colours made you fall apart
In the mirror you're a work of art
But this is real life, real life
Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose
Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money
Give me neon lights, roll me paper heights
I can feel the dice, cooling me
See the plastic life through my bloodshot eyes
I am wild alive, I am wild alive
Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose
Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day
All we do is lie and wait
All we do is, all we do is lie and wait
All we do is feel the fade
All we do is, all we do is feel the fade
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day
All we do is play it safe
All we do is live inside a cage
All we do is play it safe
All we do, all we do
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day
All I did was fail today
All I wanna be is whites in waves 
All I did was fail today
All we do, all we do

You with the wide eyes, don't lose your courage (Courage)
You swing your head high, don't be worried (Worried)
Your heart's in a free ride, feel it beating (Beating)
Caught in the headlights, climb to the ceiling (Ceiling)
We're all animals out in the dark
Got a feeling that we're all believing in
Not waiting for daylight to start
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
You with the sad smile, don't lose your courage (Courage)
Dance in the high tide and don't be worried (Worried)
Your soul's in a wild fire, feel it beating (Beating, b-beating)
Dreams on a gold wire, won't you believe it? (Believe it)
We're all animals out in the dark
Got a feeling that we're all believing in
Not waiting for daylight to start
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
We are going over, we are going over, over
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon

Standing on the world outside
Caught up in a love landslide
Stuck still, colour blind
Hoping for a black and white
Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Walking on the clouds unknown
Drop down oh I will never go, never go, never go
Floating like gravity has grown
Reach down to a deep deep hole, deep hole, deep deep hole
Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Standing on the world outside
I'm a shark in a love landslide

They're building towers that are high enough to see the clouds
Yet it don't bother me
The elevators working overtime up and down
Yet it don't bother me
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
They're building aeroplanes faster than the speed of light
Yet it don't bother me
The endless cities multiplying out oceansize
Yet it don't bother me
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
'Cause I know we need a little heart hope
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
'Cause I know we need a little heart hope

Made a home in a basement
Didn't think that I'd need the light
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted
I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low
But I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know
Gonna build a paper plane to float to you
You know, don't you know
We'll be scraping the skies without fingertips
Screaming "This is the life, we were born for this"
See I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
I've got a hope in the headlights
Stood still but I'm feeling fine
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Will get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted
I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low
But I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know
Gonna build a paper plane to float to you
You know, don't you know
We'll be scraping the skies without fingertips
Screaming "This is the life, we were born for this"
See I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
You know, you know, you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know

A room filled up with faces and the air so thick I taste it
Locking lips like they all wasted, tangled hips like it's a spaceship
Heavy heads are racing down the hallways to the basement
Where the darkness fills the space and they can feel themselves erasing
Can you feel yourself erasing?
They're bursting at the corners as the ceiling's getting shorter
And I'm stuck between a talker and a VHS recorder
The heat seeps through the border as our ice melts down to water
Can you feel it getting smaller?
I need to be solo
Freedom in the mono
Find a space and let go
I need to be solo, solo
Now I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Their mouths are dripping dryer as their souls are slipping higher
It's like treading on a wire laced with kerosene and fire
The night will soon expire as their bodies soon retire
Limbs entangled in kaleidoscopes of prima donna choirs
Ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh
I need to be solo
Freedom in the mono
Find a space and let go
I need to be solo, solo
Now I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Freedom in the lie low
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Find a space and let go
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo, solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Freedom in the lie low
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Find a space and let go
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo, solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out

Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
Before I found you
Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only
Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young forever in the sun
Ever since you came I'm living ultralife (ultralife, ultralife)
I'm living ultralife (ultralife, ultralife)
I'm living ultralife
Turn down the voice inside my head
'Cause heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
But I will climb out, find another view
Now I've found you
Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only
Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young forever in the sun
Ever since you came I'm living ultralife
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
(Ultralife with me)
Found me on a basement floor
(Ultralife with me)
Back when I had lost it all
(Ultralife with me)
Told me what the fight was for
(Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up no more
(Ultralife with me)
You elevate the life in me
(Ultralife with me)
Illuminate the in-between
(Ultralife with me)
Forever gonna feel this free
(Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up now
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
But now I've found you
Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young forever in the sun
Ever since you came I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
Oh, we're living ultralife
We're living ultralife
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me)

I'm getting high, getting high
Getting high on humans
Sitting in the backseat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide
And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide
And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, no, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
'Cause I'm getting, getting high on humans

You walk around the town like you born in a golden crown
You're speaking with the angels loud but no one understands ya
You got the sharpest bite as any killer sharker might
And you control the water like the desert doesn't matter
You're so full of it
And we're so sick of it
You're so full of it
And we're so sick of it
'Cause it's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
You say it's not enough, you're sipping from a silver cup
But is that how she brought you up to blame the hand that feeds ya?
You counting green at night but blessings you will never find
You only seek to undermine, you only seek to never die
You're so full of it
And we're so sick of it
You're so full of it
And we're so sick of it
'Cause it's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
And every time you get stars in your eyes
And the planets align in the centre
Pushing on out 'til the walls are all wide
And you're out of your mind in the centre
We see your cover, we see another
Fooling yourself in the mirror
Where is your heart? Where is the truth?
When it's all about you
It's not about you
It's not about you
It's not about you
You're so full of it
And we're so sick of it
You so full of it
And we so sick of it all
'Cause it's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's not about you

I could be the only, I could be the only one
You got that throne
Baby you got that throne
That golden majestic glow
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that hope
Ready electric go go
Super volcano flow
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I could hold you endlessly
Ultralife just you and me
Oh my heart is aching
Feel my body breaking
There's magic in the way you move
Stop the world it's only you
Oh my heart is waking
'Cause I could be your one and only
We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until it too bright, all night, all night
We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until it too bright, all night, all night
I could be the only, I could be the only one
You got that way
Baby you got the way with
Flying me outer space
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that taste
Hope in a one night blaze
That animalistic chase
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I could hold you endlessly
Ultralife just you and me
Oh my heart is aching
Feel my body breaking
There's magic in the way you move
Stop the world it's only you
Oh my heart is waking
'Cause I could be your one and only
We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until it too bright, all night, all night
We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until it too bright, all night, all night
I could be the only, I could be the only one
I could be the only, I could be the only one
I could be the only, I could be the only one
I could be the only, I could be the only one
I could be the only, I could be the only one

Heading west to where the sun sleeps
City fallout let our lungs breathe
Can you hold me, I can't even speak
Oh my, here it goes
And so the echoes slip in slowly
The edges of you keep me holy
Can I hold you, I can't even speak
Oh my, here it goes
We found love on an empty page
Kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
And now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
We are done, we are gone
'Cause this is already bigger
This is already bigger than love
This is already bigger
This is already bigger than us
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than love
Waste away into the nightfall
Hands are shaking at the last call
In the silence can you hear me scream
Oh my, here it goes
We found love on an empty page
Kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
And now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
We are done, we are gone
'Cause this is already bigger
This is already bigger than love
This is already bigger
This is already bigger than us
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than love
So I'll hold steady like a tiger in the dark
All my days are ready to be hopeless at the stars
'Cause this is already bigger than love
Oh it's bigger than us
Yeah, this is already bigger
This is already bigger than love
This is already bigger
This is already bigger than us
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than love

Like two satellites in separate orbit
Like a quiet life that's slowly distorted
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
Like two chemicals erupting in thunder
Up high in vertigo, you left me to wonder
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Like two radios, our frequency fading
Why can't we start again without tessellating
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
Like the afterglow, your words were a million
Cut short, now heaven knows a love without feeling
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
You got a grip on my heart strings and I don't wanna take it no more
Stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
You got a grip on my heart strings and I don't wanna take it no more
'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings

I sleep away all the light
I keep away, out of sight, out of sight
And when the day turns to night
I slip away and lose my mind, lose my mind
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
And as we lie silently
Your body soft, so close to me, close to me
I creep away and let you sleep
I dream today, tomorrow speaks
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
And as the sun comes out to play
So soon I wish the day away, day away
Still left unsaid, the things to say
I lost my heart to window panes
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
And my, my, my
My, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried
Oh my, my, my
Oh, how I tried

Hanging on a silver string
All the love that we could've been
Summer fading out the spring
Feel the warmth underneath your wings
And I will never let you go
All the words you want to scream
Take my heart slowly out of me
Forever falling in a dream
All the love that we could've been
I never get high when you're feeling low
I'm pulling down stars just to make you glow
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you're on your own
I'm chasing down light in the indigo
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you go
Promise I will never run
Catching fire, let the light become
Shallow edges of the sun
Feel the heat, hold it in your lungs
Never could've loved you more
By your side in a quiet roar
This is what my hope is for
Watch you float when the water's gone
I never get high when you're feeling low
I'm pulling down stars just to make you glow
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you're on your own
I'm chasing down light in the indigo
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And I will never let you go
No I will never let you go
Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I, did I, did I?
Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I, did I, did I?
Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I, did I, did I?
And I will never let you go
I never get high when you're feeling low
I'm pulling down stars just to make you glow
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you're on your own
I'm chasing down light in the indigo
It's just the way you are when you're overgrown
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you

Beyond the oceansize, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
They said the boat had sailed
I'd left them bare
Oh how the wind would wail
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
Beyond the oceansize, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
I lost my only space
To empty stares
Oh how the light would change
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
And oh my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can't forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
And oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
And oh my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

There's a space in between
Like a grey evergreen
Where the hurt never meant
Starts to linger
On the pavement below
See a crack that I know
All the corners of you
All the bones that I knew
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?
What a waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
There's a space in between
Like a grey evergreen
Where the hurt never mend
Starts to linger
On the pavement below
See a crack that I know
All the corners of you
All the bones that I knew
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?
What a waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
So alone, so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone

She knew exactly who I was becoming
Reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
Of who I might be
And for her it's hard to stomach what's left behind and what's to come in the same introduction of a king
Just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle that by any means
I produce like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
While these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young poetic genius
And I mean this, there's never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off
Get a break off just to rehire myself
For the take off
Beach House... the EP
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work

I fucked around and paid the rent for her
Feel like I'm the right pimp for her
But we got enough, she ain't gotta work
I give it to er, I got it first
She right here, I ain't gotta search
We in a party...
We in a party, I'm amused by how you move yo body
Baby girl she more poppin' in the 12 gauge Shawty

I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes
Hoes, I used to have a lot of kind
But when they realize that I gotta grind
I replaced the lies and the thighs and the hotter dimes
With the fuckin' rhymes and the ties and the dolla signs
The symbol of the producers
I full want my mental producers
I'm leaving these haters clueless
When I spit because they missin' what I get because I'm cold
Real niggas listen to the shit that I unfold
I cannot believe that whether they used to be lovin' these hoes
Now that I be on my money, it's funny the way that I govern these hoes
And I be runnin' these hoes, doin' whatever I wanna do with em
As long as I be on my paper, 'cause I'm gon let nothing in front of me after my currency flow
And if we getting the fetty so up
But I throw it away but the bitches don't want
If they talk about me
Your position to fall will be nothing
I'm done wit yo frontin, just give me yo dollars, I don't wanna holler
I don't want yo woman, I want the Apollo
But see for the Benjamins I got my shotta
And Twista love dollars but I admit
I used to love these hoes

I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money

Rappers Ty Dolla $ign and YG allegedly beat down a guy for cramping their VIP style in an Australian night club, Sunday night. Rappers performed at Eve night club in Melbourne. Police say a club goer is accusing them of punching and kicking him in the head in a dispute over their turf. The alleged victim claims he was hanging in the VIP area when the rappers and their crews rolled in trying to shove everyone else out. The victim says when he refused to budge, they unloaded on him and chased him outside. Cops eventually arrived and shutdown the club. No one else got arrested, but we're told they're now investigating the alleged assault

Burning to the ground
And I keep running, running circles, circles tryna understand
Why the dreams I die for are now killin' me
And I keep running, running circles, circles tryna figure out
Why this life is not what I thought it'd be
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings
It's like you're allergic to your medication
Meant to make you better, but it makes you worse
It makes you worse
It's like dying in your own living room
Like a U-Haul following behind a hearse
We all turn to dirt
And I keep running, running circles, tryna understand
Why this life is not what I thought it'd be
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings
Surrender of you
Surrender of you
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings
The sweet beginnings

Hope he gets me through this one more night
I pray to God, he's like one too many drinks

Mother Mary please, have mercy over me
The Sun came up and I can't believe you're over me
When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

No one's gonna love you like I do.
No one's gonna care like I do.
And I can feel it in the way that you breathe.
I know you dream of her while you sleep next to me.
I can't stop drinking about you.
I gotta numb the pain.
I can't stop drinking about you.
Without you I ain't the same.
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever!
So pour a shot in my glass 'cause it makes everything better!
Darlin' tell me what more can I do?
Don't you know that I was meant for you?
You say I feel like heaven on earth,
But you'd never know what heaven was if it wasn't for... her.
I can't stop drinking about you.
I gotta numb the pain.
I can't stop drinking about you.
Without you I ain't the same.
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever!
So pour a shot in my glass 'cause it makes everything better!
I can't stop drinking about you.
I can't stop drinking about you.
No one's gonna love you like I do.

I feel in the beginning, we were living
We were tripping, we were so high
When you told me that you love me, were you bluffin'?
Was it nothing? Now you're so dry
You can tell me that you're sorry
But I know that you don't mean it, baby, don't lie
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
And I can't blame myself
For getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here, all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere
Remember we were running up and down
And getting messy in the hallways
Told me that forever was the time we'd be together, baby, always
Now you're saying that you're sorry
But I know that you don't mean it 'cause you won't stay
No you won't stay, you won't stay
And I can't blame myself
For getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here, all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere
If there's winners and losers, then I'll be the loser
I'm still here, I choose ya
I don't want another, if we can't have each other
'Cause baby, I love ya
Maybe in a different world, baby, I could be your girl
Maybe then I'll be with you
If there's winners and losers, then I'll be the loser
I'm still here, I choose ya
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
To keep you here, ah
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here, all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

You said, "let me try you on"
So I let you try me on
That's the moment that we fell in deep
Oh, baby, I said, "just a little bit"
Then I got a taste of it
Now you got me fallin' at your feet
And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm makin' love to the enemy
I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses, small doses
Loving you, it's explosive, you know this
I can only take you in small doses
I didn't mean to fall in love
Took one hit and I was gone
Gotta get my fix or I can't sleep
Oh, baby, you're the one they warned about
Now I just can't do without
Baby, it's my appetite you feed
And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm makin' love to the enemy
I can only take you in small doses, small doses

G, Bebe, I got you
Friends come and go, friends come and go
Go like the seasons
I never know, I never know
What to believe in
And It's getting old, it's getting old
But no hard feelings
'Cause friends come and go, friends come and go
Without a reason
And I, I've been in L.A. for way too long
Can't get this air inside my lungs
It feels like I'm suffocatin' from
All the lack of the realness here
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle finger up
While I'm singing
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
And lately I've been dealin' with mad stress
Comes with the territory of a Hollywood address
Is anybody real here, I need some fact checks
I need more realness, need you to act less
'Cause they deserve Oscars, so many imposters
What's up with guest lists, can I come to your concerts?
We all got demons, I'm dealin' with monsters
I've taken every picture, signed titties and signed T-shirts
But at the same time I know I'm blessed to be here
So let's just be clear, how many kids wish they had this spot
I got success, it's not a sandy beach chair
Be careful with the people you meet here, I'm sayin'
Uh, yeah
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle finger up
While I'm singing
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
(We don't need 'em)
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

Now I'm stuck in your bed again
Oh my God, I'm too close, ooh
But this feeling is so damn good
Guess I'm loving it more than I should
I know I should leave but when you're next to me deep asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, woah
But you kinda know there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love
Oh my God, here we are
I'm fallin' deeper into this mess
Yeah, I know I shouldn't get undressed
We both know this ain't right
It's a little too dangerous
This little thing between us
I know I should leave but when you're next to me half asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, woah
But you kinda know there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me but don't fall in love

And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn
Dawg I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stuntin out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the chi the city of hella haters
Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back of hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing

Dawg it can't be
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family
A little bit a stuntin flickin dawg it ain't deep

Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lakeshore Drive, The Grammy Family
(Consequence)
Uh, uh, uh

Oh it can't Be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry

And after music meetings wit evenings with Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we, be in Miami
So when they spot me in Bentley it's gon be a stampede
'Cause we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix's
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And sense I got my shot like I was call and man b
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B
We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly paintin they nails in nothin' but they panties
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby
Headin to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step
So what y'all wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is

(This is, this is, this is
Yeah... yeah, uh-huh, uh uh, c'mon)
(Intro: Krayzie Bone)
Yeah check it out y'all, it's them Bone Thug niggaz
In the house with that nigga Twista, DJ Khaled
Duece-double-oh-six, we 'bout to do it like this - yo
(Chorus 2X: Krayzie Bone)
Just like that 9-millimeter comin' to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggaz gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun
(Twista)
Twista spit it for hustlers, Twista spit it for hoes
But I'm 'bout servin' these haters like I'm servin' that 'dro
Spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome
Spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome
Either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder
What a Twista and here I go and never on drama
With purple 'bout a pound, and my truck I pound the sounds
And my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round
Back on the scene now, and I'm always seen high
Still flow motion overdosin, smokin' on green now
When I'm on them Jordans, 20's look like 17's now
Sportin throwback Jordans from when I was 17 now
Still I'm steady (Po' Pimpin'), still spinnin and hustlin
Still (Adrenaline Rushin) like when the pendulum's cuttin'
Album comin' out soon, but I already had props
Pullin Benz's up on the block before I met yo' pop
(Twista)
The Twista, playa balla, slash pimp MC
Straight from Chi-Tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me
On some (this is, this is) and they call us C.M.T.
When they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me
With a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory
When you want that original sound, it's either him or me
The most underrated artist in this whole industry
If rappin' was the NBA I'd be Michael Finley
Still I'm bendin and grinnin, still I got pull in the club
Still I'm poppin' my collar, grindin on girls in the club
Servin' 50's, rims is bigger but I got love for the dub
They love the Twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug
'Cause I got that com' game, and I got that bomb flame
Let alarms ring when you hear the don's name
I copped the H-2-1's, some throwbacks like LeBron James
This time around I'ma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang
(Twista)
T be poppin' them tags, T be coppin them Jags
And if the T do a stick-up you be droppin' them bags
And I'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin' them rags
And if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags
T be thuggin' and clubbin, "Oh Twista that look tight"
Don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?
I'm officially fresh in my gear as I'm rockin' mo' ice
And the Mitchell and Ness from the year when I used to flow like
Annilisms are my verbal metabolisms
Shadow's prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm manor
Causin some dis-establishment-arianism
I vary in wisdom, wins only 'cause I'm carryin ism and um
A street lyrical phantom, full of verses when I chant 'em
When this shit here hit the street it's gon' be the ghetto's anthem
(DJ Khaled)
Bone Thugs, Twista, DJ Khaled, LISTENNN!
(Outro: DJ Khaled)
Shouts out to Steve Lobel
Krayzie Bone, Bone Thugs, Swizz Beatz I see you
Twista, shit's crazy right here
Cool and Dre on the track
It's DJ Khaled, historical, I'm a problem!
Listennn!

DJ Khaled, (Let Em' Know) So get your G's up
(Chorus - Lil Scrappy)
You can be as fuckin' real as you want
And hard as you will
But you will never be nothin' like me
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk
Get so drunk
But you will never be nothin' like me
You can go and fuck with a hoe
A pocket full of dough
But you will never be nothin' like me
Yeah yeah you wanna act hard
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin' like me
(Verse 1 - Lil Scrappy)
Born, Devil riches son the second
My daddy blessed me with a wonderful weapon
Hoes see me and they keep on stepin
So my momma took me to school taught me pimpin' lessons
Oh, I know you ain't tryin' ta call your people

Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen 'cause
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave,
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy
My paint wet (yup) watch it do the trick daddy
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me
If it fit then I don't want 'em they suppose to fit barely
I made straight As in Spanish Khaled they must have forgot though
(Khaled:How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one I got (oh)
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly (silly)
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it poppa willy
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em

Beanie Sigel
We The Best
(Verse 1: Beanie Sigel)
All the bullshit stops here (Here)
Let's get this clear (Yeah)
Shoot rear, fresh off the top tear (Unhh)
What I'ma 'bout to do for you, is not fair
I'm not answerin' questions for you, dat are not clear
Whuddup with State Prop. the crew, when they not there?
The moment dat they heard it the verdict, when it wasn't clear
Ya boi had the city, yeah did they really disappear?
Jay really not visit there? Dame and Beans are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from dat same fabric
Now rip the rock marriage straight from seams
Thing's ain't what it seems but at time do tell, the truth shall prevail
Until then, you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation (Fuck)
I know you hate it why I got chu waitin? (Shiiit..) - I too, am waitin'
Gotta see a couple faces, when I make 'em face it
Truth dat is dat ya boy have patience (Yes!)
As a matter a fact, it's wearin' thin
But I tell you this tho, when the New Year begins
Pussies who got nuts 'cause I'm goin' all in
(Chorus: Pooh Bear)
Can you hear me (Ay), came for attention (Ay)
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooh)
I'm applyin' every [?] in my {??} stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooh)
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooh)
Nah-uh...
(Verse 2: Beanie Sigel)
Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say dat diss record - I don't diss my dudes!
Outta respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you I couldn't get dat rude
Ionn give a fuck but I couldn't get dat crew
Cause knowin' what I do I can get like (Khh) ouu
You wanna know what I do, don't cha?
You'd love it if I told you lil' fuckers, won't cha?
Uh-unh, scrap gotta pay for this one
Sorry youngin', got to wait on this one (Yes)
The Solution, soon in stores
Date to be posted, until then - I'm on pause
(DJ Khaled: talkin')
Yeah, to DJ khaled aka We The Best
Beanie Sigel (Whudd!.. Ain't no more too it)
Give 'em more man, more
(Verse 3: Beanie Sigel)
Well fuck it I don't wanna stop
Whatchu forgot the gun'll pop
Tell me who ya wanna rock
This true love, Roc-a-Fella till I die
Nigga keep it movin', don't get caught up in this drive-by
The break's over, ya boi 'bout to take over
If dat number one spot opens, give it here (Here)
Get my crown, dust of my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sitted there
Back from the dead (Unhh) fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed (Get it clear!)
By the way, the wars on - you can't call it off
It's too late once the boss involved
Here I come!
(Outro: DJ Khaled)
In life-There's real niggas... And there's fuck niggas...

(Dre)
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because...
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(The Game)
Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs 'cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dawg
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From compton to being Dre's number one prospect so...
(Dre)
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because...
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know

(Jadakiss)
Aahhaa!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh

Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know eachother if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
(Dre)
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because...

All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(Trick Daddy)
Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared... The ghetto will still be here
(Dre)
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because...
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know

(Chorus: Paul Wall)
I'm comin' down, I'm actin' bad
I'm chunkin dueces and I'm choppin up the slab
I'm comin' through, I'm tippin dime
I'm sho a naked and I'm straight actin' a clown [x2]
Bun B:
I'm a certified D-boy, a real big nutta
A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta
Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta
Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda
What a fucked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario
Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial
They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial
Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go
Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and
Ni**a we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend
Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic
Watch what you say when we meet 'cause they know might get yo ass kicked
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK ni**a
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic muthaf*
Paul Wall:
This Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse spokesperson
Choppin up tha slab, spokes turnin', bobbies searchin
Shoppers splergin, Caked up cause my pockets swoll
I'm callin plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll
I'm from that lone star, tippin dime dat candy car
Get it shined on 59, Lean and tuck I'll cut some more
Hoes wanna who we are, Fathers wanna know what we get
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad 'cause they ain't hot
They ain't got the cash that I got,
They don't know what my hood 'bout
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop
Countin' cash and stackin not, South victory back to Scott
Crawlin like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho
Rick boy, yeah that's fo' sho', breakin 'em off, you already know
Drive slow like Kanye West, and Branyan Wayans, and Manny Mesh
A swishahouse chain on my chest, I keep it fresh, We are the best

I walk around like I gotta s on my chest
I walk-walk around like I gotta s on my chest
I walk-walk around like I gotta s on my chest
I walk around like I gotta s on my chest
That b that cash money piece cold restin the dead

(If youngin said a nigga dead then a nigga dead...)
(If youngin said a nigga dead then a nigga dead...)

The hustle that's in me, my thug mentality
Show me what to do to improve my salary,
Don't nobody move cause you could be a casualty,

One nigga left and they thought we was done,
Thought they could get rid a' da twist of the tongue,
They thought we was finished, but we just beginning,
They want me committed, to the murder, onneee
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die,
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin' my rhyme,
Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm,
Did I mention my fast flowin, lately its got my cash growin' wit'an ass showin,
These niggas can't see Bone, they already know,

And believe we ain't goin' nowhere,

Greetings from Miami Dade County Florida
Listennn,
(Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled)
One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Jadakiss:
Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together,
All I had did was hold on to the pieces until the puzzle came together,
Before it all got hyped,
I was in the corridor,
Apple before it got riped.
So I ain't gotta act like,
I'm on top of, or in front of them,
If I ain't the best dog then I'm one of them,
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss,
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth,
These niggas is different kind of soft.
Everybody know it all,
Nobody follow a protocol,
The money's only good until you blow it all.
Stacking every cents,
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president.
It's a shame what the game's became,
But the truth is,
There's really nobody to blame,
But the music.
Lets give it a minute,
Wtih no wack gimmicks,
Just hard beats and rhymes,
Blow breath back in it.
(Chorus: Jada and DJ khaled)
One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Mutha Fucka I'm the heart and sole of this,
You claim king, but we in control of this,
Name another rapper you see on the streets,

Huggin the block at the height of a beef,
Yellow tape and white sheets,
Yeah that's my back drop whenever I speak,
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me,
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy.
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit,
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant,
Joe's the business, Ask about me,
In the middle of the desert,
And they still can drought me.
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit,
You see weezy coming down on that forklift,
And money ain't a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit 'em with these little bricks often.
(Chorus: Fat Joe and DJ Khaled)
One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Ja Rule:
New york, New York nigga never went no where,
I just took off a couple of years,
But Now I'm back on my day to day,
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day,
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav,
'Cause as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art...
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds,
And argue all day about who's a bigger star,
Joe, Jada, or Ja.
SO close but so far,
So many there's no star,
I can't believe Fifty Cent and NY fell off,
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit,
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK
(Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled)
One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave 'em side to side
Put 'em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
DJ Khaled:
Shouts out everyone

I wanna go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black
When you left me alone
I never knew
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore no
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight
Put you in the past
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore
Yeah yeah
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight
No  I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
Can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you told me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, you say someday you will change
But I don't want to wait

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please")
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

I promise that one day I'll be around 
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound 
Right now it's pretty crazy 
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down 
Hey I know there are some things 
We need to talk about 
And I can't stay 
So let me hold you for a little longer now 
Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone 
When you miss me close your eyes 
I may be far, but never gone 
When you fall asleep tonight, 
Just remember that we lay 
Under the same stars 
Hey I know there are some things 
We need to talk about 
And I can't stay 
So let me hold you for a little longer now 
Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

I know that we just met
Maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something
From the moment that we touched
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you're lightin' up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I don't ever wanna grow up
Said, your place is kinda cozy
Your parents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
Just start tonight
If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby

But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause you make me feel like I got it all, yeah
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel like I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then we don't ever have to grow up
Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh baby

And I've got it, and I've got it all
I've got it all, and we've got it all
And I've got it all, and I've got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up

Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
No, yeah
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
I mean where did I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you never know what you did to me
And now you were gone
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
I don't even know your name
I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love
You punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
Till I hold you in my arms
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love
You punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
Till I hold you in my arms
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile l on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
And I don't even know your name

All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl, hmm
Met this girl when I was three or so
We were holding hands started going slow
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
'Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two sides of the stories in our defense
And I've said it once, say it again
And it'll only end up burning me
Years flew by I was less than twelve
The only reason I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me
Anytime you like and it'll work with me

And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl, hmm
So come on girl let me hold your hand
Let's go get lost, without a plan
You know you've got the world to see
You know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you have second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, yeah whatever the cost
And you know me, not the type of guy
To sneak around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized

Shawn:
Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard
Astrid:
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Astrid:
Always trying to put your two cents in
Then expecting me to change
Try to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained
Shawn:
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on trying to reel me in
But all I really need is space
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Shawn:
Tried to hold me down
But I'm surfacing
It's hard to let you go
But I gotta leave
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air

Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know
That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me

She would not show that she was afraid,
But being and feeling alone was too much to face,
Though everyone said that she was so strong,
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,
But she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,
Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,
She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright
And she knew that she would be okay,
So she didn't let it get in her way,
Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah.
A little too much, I said a little too much, oh.
Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah!
Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much.

I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of?
'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes
You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm trying to do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you
'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams, yeah
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
'Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on
And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh, and if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls,
These walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

Taking it slow isn't easy
If as far as you go 
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above
A little something and it's only because 
I don't ever wanna see you in love, but I know
That you've been coming off strong lately
And I can feel it, that you've been thinking that maybe
You got a, another shot at me 
Thinking possibly somehow, but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know
That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse if we bring it back
And I mean, if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me
And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse if we bring it back
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back
If we bring it back

Oh, there she goes again
Every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You've got me thinking what we could be 'cause
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not belong 
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
Imagination
Imagination
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

I wanna go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black
When you left me alone
I never knew
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore no
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight
Put you in the past
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore
Yeah yeah
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight
No  I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
Can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you told me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, you say someday you will change
But I don't want to wait

So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I
Am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just one more night
Lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sence of it
And you'll be gone in the morning
And you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget
Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
When you go
I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go
And you're miles apart
I wake up with shit everything
It's just a dream
Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I
Am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on

Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times
But I, I just sat next to my phone
Just know it takes it for me
To end this darling, oh
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to go

When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away
All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said
All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
Let's write our story
And let's sing a song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go
It's taking it's toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she is never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
If you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
If you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be all right, I know we'd be all right
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holding me back

Do you... do you think about me?
And do you... do you feel the same way, yeah?

You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you
Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart old and testified
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
(On my heart)Begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
It'd be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
I know I can treat you better
Promise I'll never let you down
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can

I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight
We're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further
Oh, we're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We tired, we can't take it anymore
We going through motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We don't have to keeping on saying those three empty words
No I can't keep on saying those three empty words

You've got my heart
But I can't let you keep it, babe
'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time
Trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess
You don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now kiss me softly before I say
And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
And just know that I do
Oh I really like you babe
And I wanna be there for you
For the rest of your days

They say it's not supposed to be
Tell me not to waste my time
This was never up to me
But if it was, I wouldn't mind
And I'm trying to ignore you
I try to go on with my day
But I still pick up the phone, yeah
And get lost in what you say
I can try to stop it all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down like this
And I love it how she's honest
You don't find that nowadays
And she's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway
I can try to stop it all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down like this
I can try to stop it all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

Chris Brown is in the building.
The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, cause you speaking that slang that I talk.
That sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all this jeans (?) may never see me.
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

You can be in the bac saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)
I know that baby we would disagree constitly on the basic things (we did, we did)
You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)
Baby I, want ? to decide ? by his side (I can't, I can't)
Baby, they know just what to say.
They wanna keep us away from one another
But Maybe they're right for a change
I think, God will give you

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know
But it's just 
There's some things I got to get off my chest alright
Yeah
Baby, come in, sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say, so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been 
No walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I'm finished, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so
How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
'Cause I know
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world, and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart, and I wanna know
How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryin'a say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl how you not gonna see it?
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Do you hear me crying?
There's never a right time
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
(About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
(Oh, no, it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go
(Go) 
Our separate ways
(Ways)
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Hook, line, and sinker
I knew she was mine the day I seen her
Got a big mouth bass
On the line
It's time for me to retrieve her
And go git her like a wild receiver
But we don't play no ball
See when it comes to you babygirl,
B.B. don't play at all
Verse 1 (Chris Brown):
On the real we need to nip this in the bud
'Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hating (everybody's hating)
It feels like they just waiting (for us to grow apart)
Yeah
It's just hard for me to do
But baby if I'm your man

These men just gotta understand
Little girl, with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl I can't front now

Wait, wait a minute

I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
I'm like hold up
Can I talk to her?
Hold up
Can I take her out?
Hold up, uh
That's why I gotta tell you
Verse 2 (Chris Brown):
Now a days is so crazy
Out here
You'd wanna be cutting me
If your daughter struts with me
Lucky me, and you'd be lucky too
No entourage, no crew
Just me riding with my boo
I got her
But don't think I'm replacing you
Girl know you know what I do
And I know you made your mind up
It'll take days and days and decades to find another
Dude, that's gonna walk in my shoes
And girl keep it one with you
As long if you do the usual
Now baby please
Hang up the phone

(Big Boi Rap)
Now is the time for me to come clean
Now is the time for us to turn that yellow light to green light
And proceed us together, be more better like lemon pepper on your wings
And you'll never find another fellow that's better than your king
Know what I mean, know what I'm saying, know what I'm talking about, girl who is playing?
But we can't have no picket fence 'cause we got acres and acres of land
The haters are taking it mad
That we can handle these fakers with class
Mannerisms on that C.O. five and a half on they ass
Girl, bye, give it a try, give your boy a chance
Ever since you landed in my space it seems like I'm yours again
My top friend, drop them
We don't need no audience
Pop them
Put old Google on a boss back

Wait, wait a minute

3 AM when my phone ring, beggin' me to come by, I was right around the corner...
I know I could've said no but I ain't stop, told me "come in, the doors unlocked for you".
My intuition, I should, have listened to it,
My girl, yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit...
She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off, but should've stopped, STOP!.. [sigh]
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently... she tempt me.
Right then I stopped thinkin' consequences...
Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute. listen.
Girl you know that I love.
Girl I love you.
With her that was lust...
Shouldn't have happened
I know I messed up...
One phone call started this whole thing now...
Look at the damage... damage...
Look at the damage...
Damage... damage that I caused you.
I know I broke your heart, 'cause I did you wrong.
Look at the damage, look at the damage that I caused...
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of, a few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love...
I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give, now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying.
Rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya...
No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with chu'...
Your kiss, your touch, girl you know I'm missin'
But you got my heart inside a prison, listen.
Girl you know that I love.
Girl I love you.
With her that was lust...
Shouldn't have happened
I know I messed up...
One phone call started this whole thing now...
Look at the damage... damage...
Look at the damage...
I was trippin', I was dippin', with these women, in these streets.
Lost my girl, lost out there.
Wish I could take it back.

Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds and I am trying to numb them all
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here
I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you, who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now
I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?

I have questions for you
How do I fix it? 
Can we talk? 
Can we communicate? 
Can we talk? 
Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? 
Is it my fault? 
Do you miss me?
I have questions

Baby, what'cha say?

When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye 
Now the sky, could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did didn't I can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of
Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of
Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
Novocaine for the pain
Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing
I can't feel her
Novocaine for the pain

I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try

- Stop! Let me go! You don't got no Jodeci?
- All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
- What's a Radiohead... anyway
- Whatever...

When I was younger I used to wonder like
If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school (after school)
Cause my dad don't clock off till late (off till late, off till late)
We could kick it in the living room looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
And every time somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair no fair that's cheating
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And every time a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair, no fair that's cheating
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more (no more, no more)
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me (heard of me)
Now every time somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it
And every time a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw
They say who do you think you're kidding
I know you, you stole my girlfriend
Now see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
Cause yo girl broke my heart in half
Now I'm singing 'bout heartbreak
And now I'm singing 'bout love lost

Talk to me and I better not hear a word
Do me baby, I better not feel it girl
Baby, I still got one bullet left in my nine
Finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
You write me love letters with your father's pen
If he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it
Is it really wrong that I want to be the baby daddy?
Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? Tell me it's a lovecrime
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes

Mr. Hudson:
And the city wakes

Mr. Hudson:
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
Frank Ocean and Mr. Hudson:
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But, but, but, but I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But, but, but, but I can dream
(I still dream dream dream
I still dream, dream
There will be tears)
Frank Ocean:
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on, think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles till the road runs out
I'm about to drive to the ocean
I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a ghost (no Swayze) ever since I lost my baby
I have this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile till the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
I'm going off
Don't try stopping me
I'm going off
Don't try saving
No flares
No vest
And no fear
Waves are washing me
I'm about to drive to the ocean
I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good

Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Nothing special
Every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, yeah, and keep living, yeah
And keep loving, oh, loving, loving, loving
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
Nothing special
I fell in love with you, girl, oh
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing and oh, I kept living
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I kept loving
And when the ink dries and them pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust

Ah
American love, American me
American you, American tear
American heartbreak
Oh oh oh
I took a walk with the palm trees, as the daylight fell
Sangria in the canteen, talkin' to myself
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ball gown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Gettin' married in the courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Makin' out before the judge, with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done, that I just might die with
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your, parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer, so baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment before this goes way too far"
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce
Well you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ don't break my heart, this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA
James Fauntleroy:
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch ass dude
They so vain I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga if I did it I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do

I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard and lay you on the grass
Give it you over again, over again over again
Over again over again, over again over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
Give it you over again, over again over again
Over again over again, over again over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally
My cavewoman, I'mma caveman
Doing wild things in a wild land
We keep going baby, we keep getting it baby
We'll get pebbles maybe a couple bam bams
Bam bam, bang bang, girl my heart
Goes bam and bang, feel my heart go, go, go

They look like twins
That was embarrassing

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you, hoo, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya, do ya
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)
How you feel (how you feel)
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not if my spirit keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo (ooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, hoo

Fertilizer, I'll take bullshit if that's all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer

We're spending too much time alone
We're spending too much time alone
And I just ran out of Trojans
Horses gallop to her throne
We're behaving like teenagers
Yes, wWe're behaving like teenagers
Making less than minimum wage
Still inside our parents' homes
No, I don't live in Denver
I don't live in Denver
I grew up in Sierra Leone
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I been gettin
Abandon mission abandon mission
You must be kidding
This shit feelin different
Shit feelin too good
To me glistenin
Shimmerin underneath the sunlight
The sunlight
And a new day
Will bring about the dawn
And a new day
Will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughters reaching for your nipple
'Cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle
If it's time for go to sleep
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby
She can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what I know
Knew what I know

Rosie Watson:
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'mma make more
No
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money, it's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom and disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you, absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have, ooh yeah, I'mma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you, saving my seven dollars

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high
The help don't stare
They just walk by
They must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love I'm searching for a real love
Real love I'm searching for a real love
Real love
(Earl)
Alright
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the xany gnashing caddy smashing
Bratty ass he mad he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams
With half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Annes and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck breaching all these aqueducts
Don't believe us treat us like we can't erupt
Yup
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
(Talkin bout) Do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge
She grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip I fall
The market's down like sixty stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love

I'm searching for a real love
(Talkin bout real love)
Real love yea
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin bout a real love

We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold baby, I told you I'm ice cold (ice cold)
You out here flying high
Go ahead fly that thing
High, high
But fly alone
You always smoking in the house
What if my mother comes over
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones
(What you know about him)
She took me high
(Oh did she now)
Then she took me home
(We talkin 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
Tonight she came stumbling across my lawn again
I just don't know why
I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reaching up your blouse
And no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones
(What you know about him)
She took me high
(Oh did she now)
Then she took me home
(We talkin 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
In the sky up above the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before you
Thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
I admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things, won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
Crooked cop, dead cop, how much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop, you're no good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three-hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds, ooh, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, ooh, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock, how you feeling girl? Ooh
How's the gutter doing? Crack rock

Oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose

Oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh, they have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Run, run, run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
And we'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls
Oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose
Aye, aye, aye, there's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
Aye, aye, they have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Oh, oh, remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Oh, oh, our war is over, our queen has met her doom
Oh, no more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
Oh, no more, it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl, for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra, then your six inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid, she's working at the pyramid tonight

Working at the pyramid, uh, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Pimpin' in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't go no gas tank but it still got wood grain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid, keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Yeah, working at the pyramid, oh yeah, working at the pyramid tonight, yeah

You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body, touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater, can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more, she's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Yeah, working at the pyramid, that's right, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ooh, working at the pyramid tonight

Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this

Lost in the heat of it all

Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Frank Ocean and Raoul Duke:
Got on my buttercream silk shirt
And it's Versace
(One of God's original prototype)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught, oh?
Frank Ocean:
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be
Whipping meals up for a family of her own someday
Nothing wrong
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons could you
He said, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ooh, this unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me love me love me love
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guessed it couldn't hurt me, yeah
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

Only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

I looked in my rearview mirror, (ah) and it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah...
I'm ready to make that turn, before we both crash and burn,
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us...
Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?
Hey, what happened to the butterflies? Guess they didn't count at that stop sign,
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light...
Hey, right when I think that we found it, well, that's when we start turnin' around;
You're saying "Baby, don't worry," but we're still going the wrong way...
Baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
Stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, baby,
Coastin' like crazy - Can we get back to the way it was?
They say only fools fall in love;
Well, they must've been talking about us,
And sometimes, I feel like we've been here before...
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right...
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight;
Honey, I know we can find our way home...
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
Traffic - I'm under pressure, 'cause I can't have you the way that I want;
Let's just go back to the way it was,
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, my baby,

Pressure... pressure...
Let's just go back to the way it was...
When we were on (Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue,
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue...)
(Avenue...) Let's just go back...

Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me, I don't know where to start;
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Yeah, yeah... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I love you more than anything, but the words can't even touch what's in my heart...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) No, no... (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding insane;
The words don't ever some out right...
I get all tongue-tied (and twisted,) I can't explain what I'm (feeling,)
And I say, "Baby, baby..." (Whoa, whoa...) "Baby..."
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,

Straight up, you got me all in, how could I not be? I sure hope you know... (I sure hope you know...)
If it's even possible, I love you more

That's why I keep saying "Baby, I..."
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby...
(Baby, I...) Oh, baby, baby, I...
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,

Sean Don!
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo,
On the moon - who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you... (got you...)
I got you...
Boy, you make me feel so lucky;
Finally the stars align...
Never has it been so easy
To be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...
You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh...
And I'll never let you go...
You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
I get butterflies just thinking
About you - boy, you're on my mind...
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming,
Lost in your eyes, and I lose all track of time...
You know what I need (Aye!), I know what you like; (Aye!)
Put it all together, baby, we gon' be all right...
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh...
And I'll never let you go...
You should know I'm never gonna change;
I'm always gonna stay...
When you call for me, I'm right there (right there), right there... (Right there...)
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...
(What, okay, what...)
Now if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to public transportation?
Would you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too - you know I had some girls missionary;
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,
And bible, I got it recycled - I love and I like you.
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-through,
That's why I got you...
And I'll never let you go... (I got you.)
You should know I'm never gonna change; (I'm never gonna change...)
I'm always gonna stay... (I'm always gonna stay...)
When you call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there...), right there...
'Cause you listen, and you care;
You're so different, no one compares,
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there;
I'll always be right there...
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it! I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
I'll always be right there... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
You got it, you got it, babe... (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party,)
You got it, you got it, babe... (Get your hands up... put your hands up...)
Got it, babe...

(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
You don't need a lot of money, and you don't have to play no games;
All I need is all your lovin' to get the blood rushing through my veins...
I wanna say we're going steady like it's 1954;
Now, it doesn't have to be forever,
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Ooh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Whoa-oh-oh, yeah...
You don't need to worry about makin' me crazy, 'cause I'm way past that;
So just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...
Wrap me in your jacket, my baby, and lay me in your bed,
And kiss me underneath the moonlight;
Darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart...) Oh, oh, babe...
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart, sha-la...) Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart...

Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Hold up, wait - before you go, just stay,
And talk to me for a little, baby, won't you loosen up just a little?
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...
(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
Hold up, wait - shut up and kiss me, babe;
I just wanna get a little taste, I just wanna get a little taste before you go...
See, what you don't understand - is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plans,
Started with a crush - I call you my man...
Thought that I'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill;
I spend all of my days doin', doin'...
(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time...
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
Time and my trust - don't mess this up!
(You got me falling in love, you got me falling in love, you got me falling so hard...)
Boy, you change the way I breathe when you put your lips on me - I adore you,
So let me make it clear to you that, boy, you're all I need...
Oh, baby...
(Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you, baby...)
Boy, you got all my time... (Baby!)
(I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
(Love and affection,) all my attention;
You don't gotta question if I'm really
(Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin', I'm lovin' it, baby...)
Boy, you got all my, all my...
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you got all my love, all my love?

I could write a song with my new piano;
I could sing about how love is a losing battle...
Not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
It's not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
And I could sing about Cupid and a shooting arrow;
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's so hard... (It's so hard...)
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand...
So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

And how I'm doing things my way;
If I got my piano, then I know I'll be okay, baby!

You walked in, caught my attention;
I've never seen a man with so much dimension...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...
So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms;
I know I was made for you - I'm in love with all your charm...
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you make me feel inside;
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes - I don't want to wait for tonight...
So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Well, I want you - got to have it,
And I need you like I never have loved before...
Oh, I want you - ooh, I need you;
Got to have you like I never had lovin' before...
So I'm daydreamin', with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...
Got me daydreamin' with my chin in the palm of my hands,
About you, you, and only you...

Mac:

Do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
"Do she love me, do she love me not?" (Love me not...)

Ariana:

When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it's ain't a question (q-question,)
'Cause boy, I know just what you like...
So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day;
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me...

I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind...
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time;
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you're sleeping in mine,
Come and watch a movie with me - "American Beauty"
Or "Bruce Almighty" that's groovy, just come and move closer to me...
I got some feelings for you I'm not gonna get bored of,
But baby, you an adventure, so let me come and explore you...
