Relationship with women. You know sometimes I get so
Deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
Oral sex would complete our relationship

Do what you have to
I do what I had to
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
And as I rank I wanna thank no one
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
You helped me around
My parents put me down
I never skipped town
I stood my ground
We kept showin up
Drinkin' and throwin' up
Rap was my life
As I was growin' up
Actin' a fool in school no one topped us
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious
Drivin' a bronco
Runnin' my own show
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes
And me and Bo got together
Made sense
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements
I scratched records and performed a few tricks
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown
Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock
The Genuine Article
They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice
It's like the roll of the dice
For a whole new life
But don't get my song wrong
I enjoy it alot
Walkin' around like a big shot
'Cause I'm Kid Rock
Smooth as an ice cube
Cool as an igloo
And more complex, than a rubix cube
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
And as I incline through time to get mine
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks
So I sought and fought
And alot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked
Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a sun of a gun
Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown
On the upside with nothin' too high
The Genuine Article
They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
Chuck nice break that beat down
Uh huh... Uh huh... Uh huh
KDC... huh
Six Generations of rap and I'm first
Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
I worked and worked and worked and I worked
When many thought I was just gettin' jerked
Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock
Yes me the low key MC
With the ability to rock a party
Anywhere and make people stare
I'm lookin' while I'm cookin with no care
Pumpin the new sound town to town
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown
And still I won't stop growin' this flat top
The Genuine Article
They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

Everything I do gonna be funny
New Player on the field so yield and get back
To the wall
'Cause I'm playin' ya all
Like a game
K-I-D is the name
Some complain
And they got a little fame
And it's a shame
For what its worth
I'm down with earth
Pourin it on like Ms. Butterworth
Rich and thick
Kinda quick not slow
The rhymes I fit into flow
All in a row, from the intro
To the end so, ho
Put down the microphone and go
Step a side as I make room to bloom
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style... style)
Cramp your style (Cramp your style... cramp your style)
Get down on your knees and pray when I break you
Down with a sound
Comin' down with a pound
Or a bang
If you can't hang with the slang
That I exploit
Comin' straight from Detroit
Rough without a doubt or a question
Kid Rock here in the flesh
And addressin and defining certain issues
To diss you (he diss me... aheo)
So wipe the tears from your eyes
You can't hide so don't be surprised
When I dismiss you from your throne
And send you home
As a Kid Rock clone
'Cause I can hold my own
Like ya hold a milkbone
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit
So when I hit the skit
That's it
So don't come in face with the base
And remember your just an imitation
Don't get buckwhile
In fact don't smile
'Cause I'll pull your file
As I Cramp your style (style... style)
Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)
I'll claim the boundries of my domain
Detroit... Detroit
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest
From MoTown... From MoTown
I'm like steel or concrete yo 'cause I'm the hardest
Down with a label known to be the largest
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin' to hang
Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O
I roll thick
I roll heavy
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady
So get ready to feel the pain
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane
So listen rappers and get to the program
Breakin ya down is the Kid rock slogan
And any rapper who thinks about dissin
You know what I'll say?
I got a great big dick
So anyone who can't adjust
Gets rust
And then bites the dust
Be ready to walk a mile
'Cause I'll smack that Kool-Aid smile
As I Cramp your style (style... style)
Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)

Burnin
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no...
Went to New York to cut my first LP
Ridin' down Broadway in a taxi
Hang a right at 25th
Just a little too swift, jo'
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on
Heres four bucks you drive like a moron
Lost in the apple and I'm all alone
Cause New York's Not My Home
In the village just illin with a forty in a brown bag
I'm seein freaks, and also fags
I see a set of nice legs within in my site
But it's a fuckin' transvestite
Walkin' in the daylight
Now I'm trippin' and I'm like blown
But I take another sip and say to each his own
He'd get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone
Cause New York's Not My Home
Now if your sounds are knockin' to the cool Kid Rockin'
Has got your girl jockin
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap
Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm goin' back to back
With a track, uh, that's just too clean
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty
Instead I rock the house in every major city
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali
I get down and I yodle in the valley
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brookland zones
Cause New Yorks Not My Home
Eigth ave in the 40 deuce, it's like a freak show
A lot of hookers try to pop that weak, so
I walk with a limp when I pimp through
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illin with the Beast Crew
It's pickin' up, ill check this fact
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac
Conjested, overcrowded, cya I'm gone
Cause New York's Not My Home

Bonnie shades
And a high top fade
So low you know on the mic with no aid
You didn't think in a blink no way
That I'd make the grade
But now you say I use to go to school with him
I use to go to dot dot bim
I use to know his older brother
I use to be his eigth grade lover
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak
He use to go with me, wrong you were my freak
I never gave a hoot
If a girl was cute
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots
And then they get dissed
Crossed off my list
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed
Just like so world the girls will go low
Just like Jock Custoe
And blow
Up come my drawers, see ya gotta go
It's to plain
Kid Rock's the name
And I run my game
From Frisco to Maine
Never fell in love
'Cause I'm a girl heartbreaker
But still I built my skills and I'm the
'Cause I'm the

You never had this
Wild style of my b-boy badness
Runnin' the show
Clockin the dough
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not
I'm Kid Rock
Flat top and all
Not Michael Jackson spinnin singing off the wall
But making everyone how I thump like thunder
Got over like a mother
While you went straight under
And now you can't stand
The way I jam
Hold the mic in my hand
And rock the whole land
Man get jealous if you want to
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do
'Cause I work to hard to make ends match
Started from scrath
And to a lot of crap
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch
And I'm a bad mother fucker
Believe that
I'll pop on top more flop no stop
Makin' every girl in the house want a piece of the rock
And then I'll bring a new swing
To make it understand the kid's running things
Mostly because I'm not an MC faker
And the rest because I'm the

Never thought about the other side, oh no
It was always lets go try to pull some hoes
And I pulled 'em like a tow-truck
Since I was a young buck

I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped
'Cause I'm K-K-K-K Kid Rock motherfucker
You wanna piece of me
You're just another sucker
But oh well you don't bother me none
Cause me and your girl have lots of fun

Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle
Not 'cause I make her, I wouldn't make her
But 'cause I mack her right, she loves me all night
With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody
Get down girl and read my mind
And you'll see that it's focused on your behind
You gotta lotta class and don't mind me askin
But can I go up in your fat ass
And just pump, pump, pump
What's next? check your money
It's scum and its time to jet
You bet she'll be into it more
On the bed the steps and the kitchen floor
You like the way the K-I-
Did it like I said I
Would, could, should I do it good
In your neighborhood
On your fuckin' block
'Cause I'm the coooool the Kid Rock
Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Rock, Kid Rock
Make it nasty
Hoes talk the same shit
Ya dress like a slob
But bitches still give a good blow-job
Up come my drawers and it's goodbye
The Kid Rock's just got to fly 'Cause it's 1-9-9-0
Time to fuck hoes
But before ya goin' put Jimmy in a lambskin
And we could bump all night you bet
So get set to jet and go get wet
Come on outta your girdle and slacks
And I'll shine that booty like turtle wax
With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody
Bitch

[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you know people are scared to have conversations
Like this and that's... and that's what it boils down to.
When you see a guy you already know whether not you want to fuck him,
Don't you?
[Girl:] Yep
[Voice Talking:] Guaranteed
[Girl:] Yep
All right we are gonna have a hot time in the old town tonight
See a fly skinny on the avenue
My shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
Could not believe my eyes so I lifted up my shades
And this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
Next the girl started steppin and she crossed the street
She walked to me and at that my knees got weak
Then I snapped to realize that it was my duty
To get this freak and co-wax the booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I gotta freak freak so I am gonna wax her booty
Heading for the crib I was reciting some rhymes
When the freak cut in and started telling of the times
She wanted to rock me and these were no lies
And that is when I contracted the rise in my Levis
Step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
So without delay I began to undress her
Unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
She said yes so I grabbed them titties
Next was the test to see if she was high rank
I dropped her panties and was slippin, I asked do you stank
She said no and noted to me that her shower soap is Gucci
So I dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
Headed fo her coochie
Grease it down real good
Headed for her coochie
Dang that's good
Now when I got to her coochie I looked close to see
If this girl had any types of signs of VD
She did not so I said to myself Oh goody
And I grabbed my dick and co-stuck in her puddy
Started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
You should have seen in her booty I was tearin it up
Next I whispered in her ear baby please turn over
And rocked doggie style while I was calling her Rover
Still tearin it up on her face was a grin
Holdin' on to her waist pumping harder than sin
But she was lovin' it all with her back in a arch
I busted my nut and she started to bark
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Na na bop but nop but
Now if you think the story is over just listen to this
I thought my mission was complete so I gave her a kiss
Then I was searchin for a towel to clean off my dickie
'Cause it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
And to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
The bitch dropped to her knees and licked the tip of my dick
I started trippin' cause this was something I've never seen
The girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
And when I thought that was as gross as one girl could get
She stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
Oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
In my opinion she was plain nasty
But never the less I completed my duty
I got this freak and co-waxed the booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got the freak and I waxed her booty
I love the booty, you love the booty
Hey freak come here and let me wax your booty
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop the beat
Hey yo short dog can I get a bitch
Biiiiiiiitch
Now if you like the booty come on fellas show it
This is your last verse to wax so why would you blow it
And if the ladies if you are tired of a man on your fanny
Then fuck you go home and watch the tube with granny
Cause this is booty night non stop
With the number one wax and me Kid Rock
So let's get hyped 'cause if I see you calm
I am gonna think that you are waxin with Rosie Palm
I mean really how could you be so dumb
Just look at all the girls that are dying to get some
Man, just don't be a wussy
And I'll guarantee you could get a piece of pussy
But to get it you have to realize
Don't brag to the freak about your dick size
Man, that's not the way to win it
Cause it is not the length of your wand it's the magic in it
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got freaks and I wax those booties
[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you... you know... you know what I'm sayin'.
What kind of Popsicle you like?
[Girl:] What kind of Popsicle?
[Voice Talkng:] Yeah
[Girl:] Don't matter
[Voice Talkng:] Huh?
[Girl:] It don't matter
[Voice Talking:] It don't matter?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] So what, you gonna do that to mine, ain't you?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] Well you ought to.
I mean you ought to go run to the store
And you know they would never know what you practicing for.
They'll like, "Girl you trying to put some weighty not a Popsicle
And in the back of your mind no I'm practicing to suck Kid Rock's dick.
You know? That would be kind of sweet, wouldn't it?

For the 1990s... Hoe

I think you might like to hear something from us
Stand up
Put your hands up
Come on get up
Kid Rock's in the house yo, Ready to pick up
The tempo and you know in so I will fo somewhat unconventional
But comprehendible
I'm the presentable the good lookin'
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin
Heatin the house up just like a hot plate
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate
You didn't think in a blink I'd stand here
But now you're in fear and stand clear
You can't come near this hot stylin
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
Also the perfect lyric announcer
On the set with a cold forty ouncer
Ready to glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step In Stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
'Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
N-N-Now yes I'm new
But before I'm through
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe
'Cause I'm solo
A young pro on the go
Close to an angel
But I wear no Halo
I just shake, create, and never act fake
And I learned to dislike and not hate
Because hatred leads to an uproar
Violence is one thing I am not here for
I'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do
Pump it up like an air comb presser
Teach to each like a wise professor
No job I strive to reach high
Make the girls in the house all sigh
And I'll glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Applied, Step in Stride you bet I do
Get you high like a bottle of German Brew
Comin' clean
New on the scene
Makin' girls scream if you know what I mean
'Cause they dream of me to rock the place
And put a big smile upon their face
Any girl of any race
But they have to like the b-b-bass
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on the set
Workin up a sweat
No Jive Kid Rock uparrivd
And I Step in Stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria I believe should be applied Applied... applied... applied... applied
Applied... plied... plied... plied

White boy get ready to do his thing's here
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh
Here's a new jam for you to cling to
A funky rhythm that you can swing to
Kid Rock that's me
And the party jumpin' is what I'm for seeing
So just chill or I'll boot you
Get on me and I'll shoot you
I'm fresh to that there's no guessin
Rock the mic without any fessin
With your blessin
I will get stupid, you didn't know it
I thought you knew it
I'm the kid that comes exactin
With my ace the black man
To B Boys from the Midwest
Rock the shows cause were professionals
On the set night and day while the girls say
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
The bass drops and works its hardest
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist
Clockin paper 'cause I got soul
Comin' at you from the Motor capital
Shakin booties
Not all the cuties
I'm too cool to be a little fruity
Drinkin' forties every weekend
I'm the master who's always speakin'
To some freak and if I freak her
It's at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper
But off that topic got to get it
Super dope, extremely poetic
The K-I-D-R-O-C-Kin
I love girls that's how its layin
With these jammies
Fuck the grammies
All I care about is shaking fannies
And I have been doin' it for a long time
But now I'm nineteen
And in my prime
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
On the mic is solo
'Cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos
Only rappin' 'cause I don't sing dope
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo
Lace up the Reebox
Comb the high top
Black dose with a little hip hop
And I style it with some uniqueness
You say I'm not fresh
But I could careless
One of a kind
When I rock the mic
And I'm the one that your girl is likin
Picture the girless women not lookin'
Create a beat that is fully hookin
'Cause when I get dumb
People have fun
Sisco save me the magnum
In a hell of a show I always display
While the girls say
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Ooh... oh
Upside Kid Rock, Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
On the Upside

Non-commercial lyrics run like Hershel
Walkin' fast 'cause I'm a smooth talker
Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel
Just heal
And always look for the seal that's real
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this
Kid Rock serious and I mean business
Ascending up and up I keep boosting
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston
With a mind of violence, right, I might
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's
To release to each and be friends of
Every single, individual
Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin
Come together
Jumbo, yo that's how I'm movin
I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority
Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'
A lotta just came in, sound the same in
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan
'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak
And if you step out of line your up shits creek
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it
His style ain't dope, it's a throat, and I slit it
I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride
No half steppin, I always take a full stride
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made
I used to come correct in the projects
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement
House and parties like real estate agent
So on, so strong, and everyone got along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out
New tax the acts and half the drug industry
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up
For one to get over, one must get stuck up
One will roll up, another will smoke up
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air
Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin' for a hooker
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her
For a place to hide and when he got his ride
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died
Her family cried over this homicide
And why they pondered, why she wandered
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
All to smoke a little cooked up rock
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein
Maybe I'm ahead of my time
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
Surrounded by the Great Lakes
I was once out cold at 15 years old
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes
But now I realize it wasn't too wise
So now I teach, I'll reach to each
And every single individual
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Come together
Come together
Come... come... come... come together

People like the way my style is rollin'
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin
I'm not bullshittin
Heres how I'm hittin
Funkin it up more than George Clinton
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that
I'll impress the best, I won't rest the best
'Cause I'm blessed and I just won't settle for less
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up
The one with the hair that stands straight up
People look and stare in shock
Trippin' over a Rock
Trippin' over a Rock
Chased and chased and chased, but never close to caught
And the skills I filled were all self taught
With so many styles on each panfulls
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
As the girls admire the way I aspire
To move higher and build my own empire
Not a liar, I tell no lies
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
But don't get me wrong I get wicked
Shake that ass in my face and I'll stick it
Hit it, get wit it
Knock it out the box
Trippin' over a rock
Trippin' over a rock
A genuine badman
Like Yosemite Sam man
I c-c-c-can rock the land
And bring a new swing and sensation
To represent the next generation
So slack up, you better back up
Come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
Fuck with me
With no doubt
I'll put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
I'll go deep in I won't weaken
Guarenteed to keep the house leapin
Girls flockin guys
Try to to cockblock
Cause everybody's Trippin' Over A Rock

I had a realization of God, I saw God And umm,
Its not a face or a figure or anything It was a presence,
Umm the woods (all natural) God is all natural The sun,
The universe, everything You, me were part of God,
Were part of God It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me

Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothing
Pot smokin' beer drinkin' mother fucker that's me
In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the muther fuckin' midwest 'cause there's no contest
For the pimp in the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education
All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killin' brain cells
The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
I go to sleep at night watchin' Kojak
Fuck hoes 'cause I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this...
People wanna know what I'm thinkin' but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from the shelter but I really don't give a fuck
'Cause I still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
Forties of Busch I be poundin'
I ain't dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than muther fuckin' Ted Danson
Hanson brother style when I'm rumblin'
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumblin'
Fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealin' U-hauls
I'm not into havin' clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun
But I'm no gangster like Gotti
"I'm just an M.C. to put the boogie in the party"
Back in black plus a new track
And I won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the guitar I'd probably strum it like this...
So give it up bitch 'cause I'm the kid rock
And today I know you don't wanna get shot
You look gay you're too cliche
So fuck all y'all hoes and yo Chuck pass the jay
Sellin' me out like bitches to make a quick buck
But muther fuckers like y'all just have no luck
Your little plan was a flop
Tryin' to get 'em on by sellin out the Kid Rock
A part of me was with you but yo he died,
And I'm glad you stepped off 'cause I ain't givin' no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it mother fucker if you want it let's get the beef on
'Cause I'm sure I'm sure ya
Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
'Cause I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real mutha for ya
Better jet so 'cause I won't let no hoes from the metro
Take mine "what up doe"
Come look son I'm number one...
"'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done"
In the twilight zone with Rod Serling
I ain't goin' bald so fuck Sy Sperling
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the harmonica I'd probably blow it like this...

'Cause growin' up I was never
The logical one
Packed my shit and left home
Like the prodigal son
With a bottle of jack
And my shotgun strapped
I went looking for fame
And yo I've never been back
Filled with spite
Staying high as a kite
I was dealing and stealing
Everything in sight
Pool hustling
Trying to make that green
I've been ramblin and gamblin
Since the age of 13
Working like a bitch
Like a god damn tank
Some disagree because
My rents had bank
But all that's gold
Don't always glitter
So I'll take another puff
From my one hitter
I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
Blow all my cash
On cheap women and wine
'Cause money, money, money
Ain't shit to me
But I gotta make a lot
Just to be free
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere
Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show
Please God please
I'll pay any cost
If you'd just stop the world
'Cause I wanna get off
There's too much hardship
There's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers
Tryin' to get in my brain
I've been to your mountains
I've been to your seaside
And everywhere I went
Somebody's wanted a free ride
But parasites can't fake the Rock
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot
'Cause I hold key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Shall be put to rest
I hold the key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Will catch a bullet in their chest
So pass the buddha
The funky tie hooter
And watch me rip
Because I'm such a slick shooter
Not a generic dime-
A-dozen M.C.
Never was in a posse
Never wanted to be
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere
Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show
Now I've been walking the earth
Since the beginning of time
And won't leave till
I've received that 7th sign
All this talk
Their gonna drop the bomb
But life keeps going
On and on and on and on
The world's end
Don't worry me
And I'm gonna get where I'm going
Just don't hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush
And I can't stand rushin
Everything is slow motion
Like I'm trippin' on tussin'
Fussin with the girls
They waste my time
Thrashin and bashin
Going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics
Everyday
'Cause I really ain't got
That much to say
I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
I don't wear a watch
And I don't keep time
I live my life
Just like the skipper
But only at night
Because I'm a day tripper
Twitchin, shakin
And I get more bass
Then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head
And I won't stop trippin'
Till the day I'm dead
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock hoe and I'm everywhere
Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah on down
Hey... hey, hey... hey, hey, hey, hey
On down, on down, on down, down, down, down, down
Well, well, well, well
Hey heeeeeeeeeey
Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Get my money

You can have my car if it will drive you crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Yeah you fuckin' with the Kid Rock baby
You can have my car if it will drive you crazy

Have you ever known a free lancer
Thinks that he's a camper
Known around my way as the cramper
Like P.M.S. always pokin'
But he won't go away with a little Motrin
Now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder
The worms kinda like I guess a modern day Felix Unger
When ya first meet 'em ya think he's O.K
But then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way
Hear say here I say through the grapevine
He squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line
Just like a little fuckin' fag
He always wants to get high but never has a bag
Never works says he can't find the right job
Ain't got a dime and when he does he's a tightwad
He's the dampest there's no one damp
Huh huh... he's the mother fuckin' cramper
Now the crampers red, there's no one redder
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater
He's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer
You come home he's at your house drinkin' your last beer
Pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him
Always wearin' out his mother fuckin' welcome
And then sporty's never that cautious
He sips from your forty and he always backwashes
Talk about a certain subject, he'll jinx it
Let him borrow a shirt, the stooge always shrinks it
He's the dampest, there's no one damper
Huh huh... he's the mother fuckin' cramper

I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick
I'm nothin' but a funky country hick
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump
Never been questioned by the F.B.I
Although I've tried every method just to get high
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin' on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin on
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin on
But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin on
Down to the muther fuckin' A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
No brain no pain... Now c'mon y'all and tell me what's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come On, Come On
What's My Name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Sing that shit
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uh I said what's my name?
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Now break it down like this
3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin
Taggin hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock
I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio wanna get rich ho
So count my props you can't get with me
And fuck all you cops you ain't shit to me
But hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one
For anyone tryin' to bust
And I show no shame 'cause I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on bitch
What's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on, come on
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uh I said what's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock

I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you
I'm like a train I roll hard, lettin' off much steam
In the Carhart flannel and dusty jeans baby
I never was cool with James Dean
But I be hanging tough with my man Jim Beam
I swing low like a chimp
Back in '86 man I was seein' a shrink
But now I'm humble and I can only think
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp
So ask no questions and I'll tell no lies
I got big ol' pupils and blood shot eyes
I'm on the brink if you know what I mean
And a 12 step program couldn't keep me clean
'Cause I'm the bullgod, you understand
The illegitimate son of man
The T O P to the D O G
Or the P O T to the G O D
And I'm trippin'
Said I'm trippin'
I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you
A lot of people poke fun and that's all right
But when I start pokin' back they get all uptight
You can't cap with the master son
So sit your ass down before I blast you one
'Cause I'm so greasy you can call me mud
And I feel a little Hank runnin' through my blood
I wanna flood the world with my twisted thoughts
You can bet all day but I can't be bought
Uh Break it up let's tie one on
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn
So I grab my walkman but before I cut
I got behind the garage and fire it up
'Cause I'm the bullgod, you understand
The illegitimate son of man
The T O P to the D O G
Or the P O T to the G O D
And I'm trippin'
Said I'm trippin'
And you know...
I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
Forsaken, yeah!
You ain't nothing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on get 'em up
Come on get 'em up
Come on get 'em up
I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed (yeah, yeah, yeah) on all that is forsaken
I am the bullgod (yeah...)
I am free
And I feed on all that is...
I get a feeling of peace, from a low so high
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by
These thoughts I have can't mold to sense
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense
Born and raised in the outer lands
And at times you can say I'm outta hand
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run
Every time that paper hits my tongue
And sometimes it seems so odd
When my veins are popping and I'm on the nod
I am the bullgod, you understand
And here in my head is my master plan
Uh, I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you
I see through you!

I'm not the trash you think I am talking trailor park
Come to my mansion bitch and watch me stick it after dark
I'll take you higher, higher
I'll take you lower, slower
I'll make you talk that talk and walk that walk hoe
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind till you just can't see no more

Back in the muther fuckin' saddle
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin' for a battle
Out on the plains I'm just a loner
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin' me a boner
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
And we didn't even fuck
I gave my last gold tooth 'n' gold nugget to get my dick sucked
3 days out on the frontier
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer
I need a slut for a service
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous
Man I gotta get my rocks off
'Cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger... go figure
(Chorus) I'm a desperate rado
Didn't take any practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote
Horny as a toad trippin' off peyote
Holdin' uptrains and gettin' goods by the sack
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack
And to the law I'm no stranger
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger
And then Tonto tried to get down
So I boned his bitch slit hes throat and then I skipped town
That's the way I run my show
Paint towns red
Fuck hoes and then I lay low
I know you think I'm archaic
But my dick's like a sword
I see pussy and wanna slay it
Out on the plains it gets linely
Sometimes I feel homely
New faces
New towns no one knows me
Guns cocked in my holster
U see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster
I'm always lookin' for the quick buck
Then always blowin' my cash on a bitch with a big butt
Some say my head's hollow
Fuck em... I'm just a
(Chorus II) Desperate rado
Trottin through the bad lands
A desperate rado
Tokin down with all the cowhands
A desperate rado
Didn't take much practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow
In any town I can be found at the local bordello
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,
And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin'
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand
I'm a low down buckaroo
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had
Known as the ruff ridin' Texan
A bad buck from the day of my inception.
And I was raised in the poor house
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house
Now since the day I left the corral
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside
And told me that high was the best way to ride...
(Chorus III) Now I'm a desperate rado
Always lookin' for a fight
A desperate rado
Puffin on a peace pipe
I'm a desperate rado
On the run from the law
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw

Back from the dead second l.p. here we go
Comin' at ya from the r.o.m.e.o.
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
Hat turned back in some airwalk jimmys
Never slackin' hoes I be mackin
Not wacked I don't try to act black when
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt
Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
Hit bound from the mo-town allen
Fuck a 40 I drink it by the gallon
I started out in mount clemens as a d.j.
Park parties gettin' drunk on Sunday
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip shit up
An now I've toured this nation
Pimp of the nation
Pullin hoes
Rock the set in each city then step
Me, blackman and funk daddy def stef
Bitches, they think I'm sexist
But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
And gimme a plate of that pussy on the side
Triple x on the set showin no class
Just a foul mouthed little fuckin' smart ass
No fool I went 2 high school dumb ass
Smoked dope and I flunked every class
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash

Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin' grass
Now I reside on the eastside lovin' it
Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it
Flex, sex, run of the next
Flippin and trippin' and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2
Front an get around 2 the
2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
I'm shakin and takin' and breakin I rip the mic like
Every time fuck I don't eat no manwich
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich
Somebody said I'm the best in the mo-town
But this town ain't shit but a ghost town
Who ever said it they lied they fessed
Bitch I'm the best in the mother fuckin' midwest
Wanna be heard when I rap so I yell it
Sport a tigers cap like my man tom selleck
One bad bitch I smoke hash from a stick
Got more cash than fuckin' white boy rick
My first LP wasn't pushed for shit
So jive records yo, go and suck a fat dick
'Cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like hee haw
Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down gratiot
In my grand marquis I pimp to the beat
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I've been livin' a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto look like heaven
And I believe it stems down from my family situation
I never liked my old man
I couldn't stand to be around him
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin' at his picture, yeah
My heart turns to stone and I think of this
I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
You never loved me, you never held me tight
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night
You tried to make me think that your ways were best
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress
Life it's the ultimate sin
A game with no rules that you're expected to win
My personal hell's hidden with a grin
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool
UYoushould've went to school like your bigger brother
But you played the fool with a different color
Runnin' ship with a whip
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped
Money made you so wise
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes
Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first
You said a man is as good as his word
But your mind was closed and mine never heard
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
Look at you then look at me...
You ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me
And all you ever gave a fuck about was money see
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free
Now I know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy
And I know at times I was not always there for you
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so
I always loved you I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know
Dah
All right, get down baby
Yeah
I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I need somebody please, please help me
I need somebody you must tell me who I am
Hey, hey, hey
Tell me who I am
Hey, hey
Tell me who I am
I am, I am
Tell me who I am, am, am
Tell meeeee
Tell meeeee
(A Minute Or So After The Song Is Over...)
If it looks good, you'll see it.
If it sounds good, you'll hear it.
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it.
But... if it's real, you'll feel it.

Cruisin through town in my jacked up truck
Eyes open 'cause I'm scopin for a big butt slut
One that I can take straight back to my house
And that will suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth
Now get get with it look across the street
I seen a skinny in a skirt boppin to the beat
So I gapped up my 40 stuck it under my seat
Rolled up on the freak and I started to speak
But before I could talk, she goes and grabbed my dick
Licked her lips and started talkin' that porno shit
She said look here I know you're kid rock
Then whispered in my ear ("I wana swallow your cock")
Well blow me up and then blow me down
'Cause I think I just found the biggest freak in town
And now I can't wait to get her back to my house
Set her on her knees and put my balls in her mouth
Balls in your mouth
Ballls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth) 2x
Went back to my crib with no delay
Big grin on my gril with not much to say
Except hey yo bitch how's about
I drop my drawers and put my balls in your mouth
Then it was like straight audible porn
She dropped to her knees and started blowin' my horn (horn blows)
And after that, without a doubt
She opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth
Next the cutie started rubbin my back
And she put her finger right between my bootie and crack
So I grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut
"Ain't nobody stickin nuttin in my butt"
Now right then I knew I had a hoe and a half
And all that I could do was sit back and laugh
Stare at the ceilin thinkin' about
This chick I just met's got my balls in her mouth
Balls in your mouth
Balllls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth)
2x
After I busted my nuts I drove her to the cut
She said ("i hope you don't think that I'm a big slut...
...And please don't tell anyone wat we've been through")
The next day I told the whole fuckin' crew
Spread the news to the whole damn town
And to that chick, it musta got back around
So I told the hoe sorry and tried to make our mends
But she tried to front me in front of my friends
Runnin' off with her lip talkin' all that shit
That I'm a bitch I'm a prick and that I gotta small dick
I just waited till she walked away to shout
Fuck you bitch you had my balls in your mouth!
Balls in your mouth
Ballls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth)
2x

Hey Kid Rock, tell 'em how your livin'
Man I spend my birthdays at Denny's eatin southern slams
I'm not a butt nut you know that I never bang
But I lick more coochie than K.D. Lang
But I'm not gonna kick an X-rated rap
And even if I did you know that you couldn't fade it black
Cause my rap's like gold, or precious gems
While your rap's like an 8th full of beeners and stems
Kid Rock I love to sing
Call me the king of pain, but my name ain't Sting
Or Roger Clinton, I'm not riding off my brothers fame
Cause all you sap suckers don't even know my brothers name
Bill Ritchie he lives in Chicago
He rides through town in an Eldorado
Maldo black, real white so I'm lookin'
And I gotta give it up to my homies in Brooklyn
Romeo Mt. Clemens to Metro Beat
From Huston, to L.A., back to Stoney Creek
Like I said, roll it up take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down grass shit
It's guaranteed every time we get hoe's
I play on my guitar, puff loud through my big nose
You'll never see me in Thyland
But you can catch Kid Rock on a hot day rollin' on the island

Sugar walls to my balls that how I'm shovin it
Wham bam thank you mam a dirty nigger wrote

Pop, pop, pop, pop, now watch that nigger drop
There goes my girl, yell the phone somebody call the cops

With the 40's, hoe's, do I make myself understood?
Yeah, I put you on them black hoes
They used to like your white ass, your blue eyes and your pionty nose
Yeah we poked hoe's in heards (word)
Then I took your black ass out to the subberbes
People don't know about you and me (or unity)
Ain't it funny how were still down in 93
Don't let me catch them slimmys when you roll 'em through
'Cause if you do then ima hafta choose the weapon that I gotta use
And light my infared dead on that forehead
Woof, woof, woff mother fucker now your left in red
Your runnin' around with a string of chicks
Now nigger you don't wanna see me or the K to the I to the mother fuckin' D
Straight G's from the streets
I'm droppin' your lyrics on your best Kid Rock beat
Now ima kick ya like this and like that
I'm kickin a funky track with Kid Rock because we go way back
Back in the day's to the late 80's
When I dropped the gang stuff, drunk, and dirty young niggers
Crazy, but now were kickin it in the 90's
And Cruew St. is where the niggers were frontin
Just coolin with my buds, slangin shit late at night
But the jealous niggers trying to tell us
Slangin ain't the way to get paid
But fuck the bullshit all I'm thinkin' about is ponytail
I gotta get made, I got a pocket full of lint
Too much late former rate, and I gotta rest it
Shit the hookers, the hoe's the takers, the pros
A nickel plated nina ready to explode
On any nigger tryin' to jack, rat-a-tat-tat
Put his ass on his back for the comosat
Now can I keep my style and get wild?
Me, Kid Rock and Wes Chill, just coolin on the island
It's like this and like that
I told you mother fuckers better pack your back

I got my Harley on the highway revvin
If a whip-it was a nipple I'd be lost in heaven
I'm rollin' straight 7 so what up?
Like Bush Wisk said you play pussy get fucked, your outta luck
'Cause I'm the best mother fucker from this time
For breakfast I snort cocaine and eat pork rines
Shockin signs is what I'm sowin
I'm the hoe and I'm knowin' the mind blowin' home growin'
In my back yard, lyin' in the sun you know I fry quick
Gettin' lit when I be smokin' that tye stick
Cause that's what the Kids all about
I like rollin' up on hoes and screamin balls in your mouth
From South Alabama, North Montana, I'm smokin' and
Chackin cause you know I am a
Little long haired high on, and you can find Kid Rock
In the gutter on the mother fuckin' island

You wanna get fucked by me dick mick dangles
Then drop your funky drawers straight down to your ancles
And swing that big ass in my direction
For a little safe sex for the inspection

I'm learnin real quick gotta wrap my johnson
But just insace I hope your on the pill
'Cause I been known to ride a pussy like bad boy Bill
And I hate to spill, or raise the stakes
And nutin all up in your shit if my rubber breaks
Now my dick rocks when I'm lickin' all that gin
So spread your phony legs and let the games begin
Wait, hold up bitch, say what's with the bad cough
I see ya right away, I think I'm gonna go jack off

Dum diti dum dang dang di dum
2 bums in an alley with a bottle of rum
1 bum said look Jack I'm the shit
Put his knees to his ears and sucked his own dick
My mothers crazy I think she sniffs glue
She never liked me and I know that's true
Kicked me out the crib becuz I got a tattoo
No one loves me and no one cares
And all I ever get is funny stares
I can't help it if I'm nothin' but a wino
So I hang at the zoo chillin' with the rhinos
Stealin' bottles of booze outta A &amp; P
I know a girl at Denny's and I always eat free
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper
For Christmas I bought the old man the Clapper
I'm so dapper you can call me Dan
But they call me round eye when I'm chilin in Japan
Got a bad ass bitch and she ain't no dike
But fuck that ho and let me tell ya what I like
I like bean burritos from Taco Bell
I like trippin' on acid with Dick Vitale
My hair ain't plastic and my clothes aren't clashin'
I write my rhymes on a schooner in a 90's fashion
Took too many many trip and now I can's stop trippin'
My mellow D. killed a rat in the kitchen
U think you toke tuff I'd disagree
Nobody blows more doobs than Richard D.
I get ill on hoes who I know ain't fertile
I'm a real jet setter like Cecil turtle
I'm down with Bill Bands so Fuck Joe Glover
And while I'm at it muther fuck fat ass Sally Struthers
U look fine girl kinda undercover
But I can't fuck ya 'cause you look like my mother
I said dang digee dang di dang dang
It ain't Eric Estrada or Kool and The Gang
U know I hand in the Clem chillin' on the strip
With all them mother fuckers who slang that shit
U know I'm a pimp hold my dick like a holster
U sing it "all the girls want a kid rock poster"
Lifes a big joke and that's how it strikes me
But fuck it 'cause I know "Somebody up there likes me."
Assholes are only assholes, fo sho'

Smokin' any thing that I can fit in a pipe
Slammin' bottles of tussin and going fishing for pike
Never uptight my high won't permit it
My problem's life but I don't sweat it, just live it
And I'm not your average rapper
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper
So bitch better watch your back
'Cause I push more power than a Marshall stack
Never the wack but oh so pesky
Some say I can't flow but muther fucker don't test me
And if you arrest me you dumb cop
I'll find your daughter and I'll give her this cock
Kid Rock's my mother fuckin' name
Bitch you know me so pass the O.E.
And don't talk about takin' me out
'Cause I got your girl and I'm makin' her shout
Just like a piano I'm really grand
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan
Some friends call me fly
But most just call me when they wanna get high
It ain't the disco Cisco Kid muther fucker
It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting
Dick-swingin' pussy lickin' punk
Little skinny muther fucker and I'm not no hunk
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk
Walk with a limp 'cause I pimp like a pro
And if ya dis me punk I'll fuck your ho
And though you think I'm nothing more than a young punk
I'm like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk
I move quick like a cheetah
And it ain't shit to me to just beat a
M.C. down who looks like a dick
Jumpin' 'round like a homo on a pogo stick
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk
And just "Give 'em an example of how a D.J. works"
'Cause it's blackjack and I got two aces
Been many places seen many faces
And everywhere I go people wanna jive
So I keep my fingers on my .45
So don't cross my dusty path
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass
Don't front ho pass the jay
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J.
To the beat y'all and I won't stop
And I'ma rock this shit till your eardrums pop
Everybody's tryin' to get a piece of the pie
But I don't let bullshit spoil my high

A bottle of jack's got my manager grinnin'
Yeah that's me that keeps the turntables spinniN'
I'm countin' cards and I keep on winnin'
I know God hates me 'cause I'm always sinnin'
U don't know me blow me ho you wanna get hot
You'll get your ass blown out fuckin' with the Kid Rock
Eatin up ya suckers just the same way a beast could
Tearin through your town like muther fuckin' Clint Eastwood
'Cause I be fakin the rhymes that keep ya shakin'
Makin' a lotta money but don't let me be mistaken
I never thought about climbin up the pop chart
And I don't give a fuck you can't buy my tape in K-Mart
Give me a choice between soundin like an ass wipe
Or sittin' in an alley smokin' crack from a glass pipe
I'd be as skinny as a junkie with the AIDS plague
But still I'd look better than a puppet tryin' to get paid
Now check the rhyme as I climb and I co get rude
And send ya runnin' playin' pussy like Shaggy and Scoob
'Cause I'm the wrong dude to fuck with my mouth is mental
And I'm a tear shit up like they did in South Central
Son of a bitch I'm the son of a bitch
Nobody ever loved you so you're the son of a dick
I'm a product of a young girl top in her class
You're a product of a hooker who was sellin that ass
And your styles in the past it's old and dusty
So from now on I'm callin u M.C. Crusty
'Cause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted
So now I'm gonna drop ya like a hit of acid
And when I rip ya people they might stare
'Cause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair
An yo buck won't you please be a friend
And tell your mom I wanna fuck and I'll pick her up at 10

She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talkin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
Mmm-hmm, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her
Oh-oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me, I get turned around
(Oh-ohoh, oh-oh, oh-ohoh, whoa-oh)
She's got a smile it heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
Mmm, I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
Anyway, hey

You can make me free
You can make me smile
You can make me be
Like a little child 
You can melt the ice that chills my body 
You can dry my every tear
You make the lonely hours disappear
You can make me free 
You can make me rise 
You can make me see 
So open up my eyes 
Don't you know my only real moments 
Are the ones I spend with you 
How I long to drink some wine again with you 
I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with its heart full of song 
Won't you color my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 
You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime 
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 
I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song 
Won't you cover my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 
You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime 
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 
I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song 
Won't you cover my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 
You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 
You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try

Baby all the lights are turned on you 
Now you're in the center of the stage 
Everything revolves on what you do 
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age 
And you can always have your way somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
You can walk away from your mistakes 
You can turn your back on what you do 
Just a little smile is all it takes 
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too 
Loneliness will get to you somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply 
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry 
So do I 
All the people want to know your name 
Soon there will be lines outside your door 
Feelings do not matter in your game 
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore 
So your life is only living anyhow 
And everybody loves you now 
Close your eyes when you don't want to see 
Stay at home when you don't want to go 
Only speak to those who will agree 
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know 
You have lost your innocence somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever 
And it's all been done before 
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor 
No more 
See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl? 
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down 
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall 
This is what you wanted; ain't you proud? 
'Cause everybody loves you now

Of all the people in the world that I know 
You're the best place to go 
When I cry, when I cry 
I never asked for much before, not before 
Things are changed; I need more 
Tell me why, Judy, why? 
I never thought that she would say 
Say goodbye; but she did 
And now I wanna die. I wanna die 
I never thought that I would need, need a friend 
But I did, in the end 
Tell me why, Judy, why 
Oh, what a scene 
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way 
Oh, where you been? 
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day 
A man my age is very young, so I'm told 
Why do I feel so old? 
Tell me why, Judy, why? 
Oh, what a scene 
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way 
Oh, where you been? 
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day 
There's no tomorrow 'cause my dreams did not last 
So I live in the past 
Tell me why, Judy, why?

Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain
In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain
Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me
High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain
Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me
So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.

Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream 
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 
Oh, Elisa, you must begin again 
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end 
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend 
I loved you but I thought I was your friend 
Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 
Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea 
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me 
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be 
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be 
So turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song
And I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free 
Feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face 
It's liftin' me high above my ordinary place 
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace 
Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And who knows what your next move will be? 
Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free

I've been livin' for the moment 
But I just can't have my way 
And I'm afraid to go to sleep 
'Cause tomorrow is today 
People tell me life is sweeter 
But I don't hear what they say 
Nothing comes to change my life 
So tomorrow is today 
I don't care to know the hour 
'Cause it's passing anyway 
I don't have to see tomorrow 
'Cause I saw it yesterday 
So I listen for an answer 
But the feeling seems to stay 
And what's the use of always dreaming 
If tomorrow is today 
Still I'm waiting for the morning 
But it feels so far away 
And you don't need the love I'm giving 
So tomorrow is today 
Oh, my. Goin' to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me 
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it 
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it 
Too late. Too much given 
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it 
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way 
And some day if your dreams are leavin' you 
I'll still believe in you 
I don't care to know the hour 
'Cause it's passing anyway 
I don't have to see tomorrow 
'Cause I saw it yesterday 
Though I'm living and I'm singing 
And although my hands still play 
Soon enough it will all be over 
'Cause tomorrow is today

Well so here I am at the end of the road 
Where do I go from here? 
I always figured it would be like this 
Still nothing seems to be quite clear 
All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled 
But I just can't decide where to go 
Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep 
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know 
That I've got to begin again 
Though I don't know how start 
Yes, I've got to begin again 
And it's hard 
Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head 
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes 
I see the way that I been spendin' my days 
And reality has caught me by surprise 
I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today 
And it sure was a grand waste of time 
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face 
I just can't get you out of my mind 
That I've got to begin again 
Though I don't know how start
Yes, I've got to begin again 
And it's hard

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way
Said now, this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray
Mmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday
Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
With me

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"
La, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"
Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"
Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, dum
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
Gotta get ready to go
You say you went out late last evenin'
Did a lot of drinkin', come home stinkin'
And you went and fell asleep on the floor
And then your lady comes and finds you a sleepin'
Starts into weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'
And you better get your ass out the door
Ain't no crime
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
It ain't no crime
Well, ev'rybody gets that way sometime
It ain't no crime, oh
You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
And you gotta get ready to go
Well, now you tell me you love somebody
And you'll love 'em forever, you may love 'em forever
But you won't like 'em all of the time
Well, now you tell me you need somebody
For the rest of your life you might have somebody
But you won't want 'em every day
Ain't no crime
Well, it's just human nature, happens all the time
It ain't no crime
Well, don't think twice about gettin' it off your mind
It ain't no crime, oh
Ain't no crime,
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
It ain't no crime
Well it's just human nature, happens all the time
It ain't no crime, oh
You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
Gotta get ready to go
And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'
The grass keeps growin', you gotta keep goin'
And the Lord'll have mercy on your soul
Oooh, yeah, Lord, Lord
La la la la, ooh

When you look into my eyes
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow
Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home
When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
You say, "Use my body for your bed
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night"
Well, I'll never be a stranger and I'll never be alone
Whenever we're together, that's my home
Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indiana's early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you
Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home
If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
There's a roof above and good walls all around
You're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house 'cause you're my home
You're my home

From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande
Well, he started with a bank in Colorado
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
And the word spread of Billy the Kid
Well he never travelled heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
And he never had a home
But the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name
Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they love to tell
'Bout when Billy the Kid came to town
Well, one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said, "String 'im up for what he did."
And the cowboys and their kin
Like the sea came pourin' in
To watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid
Well he never travel'ed heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
Well he never had a sweetheart
But he finally found a home
Underneath the Boot Hill grave that bears his name
From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande

Today I'm livin' like a rich man's son
Tomorrow mornin', I could be a bum
It doesn't matter which direction, though
I know a woman in New Mexico
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong, oh
And if I don't have a car, I'll hitch
I got a thumb and she's a son of a bitch
I do my writing on my road guitar
And make a living at a piano bar, oh
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong
(Ooh) Lightning and thunder
Flashed across the roads we drove upon
Oh, but it's clear skies we're under
When I am together, when I sing the song
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong, oh
Fun ain't easy if it ain't free
Too many people got a hold on me
But I know something that they don't know
I know a woman in New Mexico
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong

He always found it hard to take her
She wouldn't listen to advice
And though he never tried to make her
She often thought it would be nice
Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
It's been a long time comin'
But she's feelin' like a woman tonight
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye
She tried for years to be a good wife
It never quite got off the ground
And all those stories of the good life
Convinced her not to hang around
Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
And she doesn't know what's comin'
But she sure knows what she's leavin' behind
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye
And though she finds it hard to leave him
She knows it would be worse to stay
He wouldn't understand the reasons
That make a woman run away
Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
With some money in her pocket
She's a rocket on the Fourth of July
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye
She's headin' out to California
With some money in her pocket
She's a rocket on the Fourth of July
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Though I know it wouldn't change your feelings
And I know you'll carry on the best you can
If I only had the urge to tell you
If you only knew how hard it is to say
When the simple lines have all been taken
And the radio repeats them every day
If I never find the song to sing you
If you always find it hard to comprehend
Well, you know there wouldn't be much meaning
If I had to sing those tired words again
Life goes on and on
And tonight will soon be gone
But if we try we can be sure
If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
But I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man
La la la la, la la la la
If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Oh, but I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man

Well, it's a rainy night in Paris
And I'm sitting by the Seine
It's a pleasure to be soaking
In the European rain
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine
Oh, but in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line
Oh, in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line
Sweet Virginia Cigarette
Burning in my hand
Well you used to be a friend of mine
But now I understand
You've been eating up inside me for some time
Oh, and I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line
And I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line
Somewhere along the line
Well I know it's just a matter of time
When the fun falls through and the rent comes due
Somewhere along the line, woah
Well, you know I love my woman
And I would not let her down
And I did my share of lovin'
When I used to get around
Now I'm satisfied that she is lookin' fine
Oh, but you pay for satisfaction
Somewhere along the line
Well, you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line
Hey, it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes, a young man is the king
Of every kingdom that he sees
There's an old and feeble man not far behind
Oh, it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
Well, it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
Well you know, it will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line, oh

Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
You're tired of livin' in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while, hmmm
So you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile, mmm
Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin', oh yeah, yeah
Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call, mmm
So you stand on the corner in your new English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Oh, but still your finger's gonna pick your nose
After all, mmm, yeah
But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, you'll be smilin', oh, oh yeah, yeah
So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
And what for, mmm
So, you've got everything but nothing's cool
They've just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore
But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
La da da, oh yeah, yeah
So you play your albums and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong, mmm
And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you're twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long, oh, oh yeah yeah
But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
Oh, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will make it right tonight
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight

Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain
In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain
Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me
High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain
Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me
So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way
Said now, this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray
Mmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday
Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
With me

She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talkin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
Mmm-hmm, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her
Oh-oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me, I get turned around
(Oh-ohoh, oh-oh, oh-ohoh, whoa-oh)
She's got a smile it heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
Mmm, I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
Anyway, hey

Baby all the lights are turned on you 
Now you're in the center of the stage 
Everything revolves on what you do 
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age 
And you can always have your way somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
You can walk away from your mistakes 
You can turn your back on what you do 
Just a little smile is all it takes 
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too 
Loneliness will get to you somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply 
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry 
So do I 
All the people want to know your name 
Soon there will be lines outside your door 
Feelings do not matter in your game 
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore 
So your life is only living anyhow 
And everybody loves you now 
Close your eyes when you don't want to see 
Stay at home when you don't want to go 
Only speak to those who will agree 
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know 
You have lost your innocence somehow 
But everybody loves you now 
Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever 
And it's all been done before 
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor 
No more 
See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl? 
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down 
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall 
This is what you wanted; ain't you proud? 
'Cause everybody loves you now

Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream 
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 
Oh, Elisa, you must begin again 
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end 
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend 
I loved you but I thought I was your friend 
Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 
Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea 
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me 
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be 
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be 
So turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song
And I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long

Come around when you're feeling low
When you're down you can be sure
That I am the one place you can go
It's been a long long time
And you haven't made up your mind
It's been a long long day
And there isn't enough to say
It's been a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.
Make a call when you want to know
After all
You should be sure
That I am the one place you can go.
It's been a long long road
And we've still got a way to go
It's been a long long song
But we're gonna try rambling on
Baby
Baby
Such a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.
I'm heading back to where I've been
But there's a change
I can't get used to being free with you
It's strange
It's been a long (such a) long while
Now I see you smile
Nothing left to do but to let it rain
It's been a long long road
And we've still got a way to go
It's been a long long song
But we're gonna try rambling on
Baby
Baby
Such a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.
I'm heading back to where I've been
But there's a change

Didn'cha know what I mean
When I said 'I love you Josephine'? Yeah
Josephine.
Nothing I say does justice to you
Or lights up the day the way that you do
Josephine.
Like a beautifil queen
You deserve a crown
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.
Well
I pick up the phone and give you a call
You come around with your sneakers and all
Josephine.
Well
Sit right back. Suppose I went away. Ah
Honey.
Would your love turn sour and moldy green?
When I take from you the light of yoodle-eh-hi-hoo
Would I make you sad
My Josephine?
You arrived on the scene
You made me glad I'm alive
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.
Well
Nothing I say does justice to you
Lights up the day the way that you do
Josephine.

When will it come around
The wind that will inspire
When will it make a sound
The sound I desire
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true
Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw my mistake
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true
All my life I have known who I am
A troubled man, but I stand
All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream
'Cause we all need something to do
A certain someone... that's you

All I got is a black cross
And two crabs in my left eye
What you say you want you want
Like a lump in your right thigh
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
You the users of the wheel
Stink of oil and electric eels
Users of forbidden tools
We must be the fools
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
Cancel the world
Erase history
There is no future
As far as I can see
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend

It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautiful
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I gotta shout, shout
...And then gotta shout, shout
Blues for Meister
You sweet little thing
Blues for Meister
I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up
Sittin' on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby
I really miss you now
Well have some respect
For my cat
He got squashed by the wheel
Of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico
Your food's still in the cupboard
Hangin' in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see

Show me a sign that I love you 
Blow me a mind as you always do 
Remind me to tell you that I've come to 
Believe in the beauty, the power of you 
Woman, dissolve into the sea 
The body of water is calling me 
The god of my daughter is always free 
There's nothing to solve and you're solving me 
Ooh, I'm in your company 
Ooh, body that's calling me 
Ooh, I'm in your company 
Throw me a line I could use one 
I special-design me 'cause I'm your son 
Two thousand below where I feel my love 
The body of water where I come from 
I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal 
Fire from the other side out there 
Formations flow like screams 
I'm made with a life to spare 
Get the jizz, Mister sism? got a rhythm 
Technology of a prayer 
Scientist to the prism of faith 
And hope so I am there 
Baby I'm old, can you come here? 
The science of love is becoming clear 
Invisible love with the color still 
I need to a place in the atmosphere 
And I may believe...

There's a port on a western bay 
And it serves a hundred ships a day 
Lonely sailors pass the time away 
And talk about their homes 
And there's a girl in this harbor town 
And she works layin' whiskey down 
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round" 
She serves them whiskey and wine 
The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 
Brandy wears a braided chain 
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain 
A locket that bears the name 
Of the man that Brandy loves 
He came on a summer's day 
Bringin' gifts from far away 
But he made it clear he couldn't stay 
No harbor was his home 
The sailor saidn "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes 
When he told his sailor stories 
She could feel the ocean foam rise 
She saw its ragin' glory 
But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man 
And Brandy does her best to understand 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 
At night when the bars close down 
Brandy walks through a silent town 
And loves a man who's not around 
She still can hear him say 
She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 
"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

She
She
She
Lock the bus undo the chain
Getting all to hot, gotta head on Fifth and Main
I look like you I feel the same
You don't even know my name
I got this tied up to my cell
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shell
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy
I don't like blood into the chain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body
I must still, taking your bod away
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you. I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body

In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all untrue I
Know, I'm a little slow
Desperate and it shows
In the name of spending street
Burning bush and a busted knee you
Stole, all the rain and snow
Who will be my Eskimo
It's what I wanna know
It's time to undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Searching for an Eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
What did they say
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an Eskimo, someone, like you
In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my price I
Sold, just a little love
Who will be my Eskimo
That's what I wanna know
Before I undergo
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to
Ooh aw
Searching for an Eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
Hey, hey, hey
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an Eskimo, someone, like you
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find an Eskimo

They say, in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it 
Oh, I do you
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 
You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated 
Oh, I do you
Now, put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 
The medicated state of mind you've found is over-rated 
Oh, I do you
You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 
Come on God, do I seem bullet proof... 
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded

Fuck you!
Fuck your whole family and your bare legged kids
Fuck you!
Fuck your little sister and your little brother
Fuck you!
Fuck all your friends and everyone
Fuck you!
Fuck your little puppy and your puppy dog
Fuck you!

It must have been your funny face
It must have been your love
Must have been your paper chase
That wasn't quite enough
Must have been your tiny dance that
Made me laugh out loud
Must have been your angel dust that
Put me on your cloud
You're the reason why
You're the reason I
It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said
It must have been your love... in a little bit
It must have been your love
It must have been your poppy eyes
That made me step outside
It must have been the sight of tears that
Let me know I cried
It must have been your bunny shake
It must have been your love
A lot of girls won't come around they
Treat me like a wolf
It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said
It must have been your love... I gotta give it that
It must have been your love
You're my angel, baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo-lo-lo-lolita
Let her see me deep in love
You're the reason why
You're the reason I
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
You're my angel baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo-lo-lo-lolita
Let her see me deep in love
Lopsided eyes and a crooked frown
Make more of life, just settle down
Every single little princess needs a crown
Make more of life, just settle down
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love

Ooh
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free
Ooh
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me
Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love
I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
Ooh

I told you before, stay away from my door 
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone 
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
No! 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Now that I showed you what I been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa 
They didn't want me so they made me a star 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 
I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 
I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, feel your own pain 
I, I found out! 
I, I found this out! 
I, I found out!

Bang on my window if
You want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when
She took her little book out
I'm steady loving on the
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So advantageous
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight
Under the hula moon I'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture
This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing
What you lose?
Your virginity
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
My intuition was a
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in
Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above I'll
Take the time to thank it
Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa
But they call her Desdemona
Come out and see me for
Some street communication
I think it's sweet of you
To be my motivation
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always seemed
To stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One look was all it took
And now it's much too late for me
To take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance to
Show you I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
Now since I've been true where it's at
I want you back!

Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
Burn it up, no need to reconcile
Come and see me, I'm your west end perfect stranger, in America
Lady on that state's so full of style
Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe
The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin' night and day (?)
No one said that you would need a crowd
The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now I only see your face in clouds
Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe
Tell me so (?)
Do you know
Does it show
When I'm low
And then again, when I feel your love from far away, I think of yesterday
I see a family we know how to smile
There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
There comes a time when we will walk that mile
Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

On the corner into my car
I drive forever never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star
California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it off
Take more than your...
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
A pendulum inside of my bed
Swingin' low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough no
Another drop will never fix it
California mountains in the mornin'
Get along, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get if off
Take more than your friends
If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
I shut it down the look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement
Take more than your friends
If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man
On the river into my dock
I paddle thought the shadow and fog
To ponder all of those who came before me
Another piece for building my arch

Let's make evil
Let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirty wood
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away
Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some seem dirty
Some stay clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

I will follow
I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see
A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found
Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give it to me
Just give up your eyes
Oh
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow

I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.
My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.
I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.
Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.
Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will.

Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, Yo-ho-ho.
Yes, and I know the truth about you.
She cat.
And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one

Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, Yo-ho-ho.
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

Into the heart of a child
I stay awhile
But I can go there.
Into the heart of a child
I can smile
I can go there.
Into the heart, into the heart of a child
I can go back
I can stay awhile.
I can look straight
Into the heart.
Into the heart.

Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
You say how long
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

There's a place I go
When I am far away
There's a TV show
And I can go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh
There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh
Sometimes the lady takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys

A picture in grey
Dorian Gray
Just me by the sea.
And I felt like a star
I felt the world could go far
If they listened to what I said.
Just me, my ego by the sea.
It washes my feet
It washes my feet
Splashes the soles of my shoes.

Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I wasn't sleeping, what's at stake?
A day without me.
Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?
A day without me.
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
They shed a tear and on they go.

Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye.
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all.
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed.
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.
Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she was gone with the morning sun.
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.
Another time, another place
We lie.
Another time, another place.
We lie.
Another time, another place
We lie.
Your time, your place.

Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to.
Toy, broken toy
You can shout and shout, 'til you're inside out
But if you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric co.
Red, running red
You play for real
But the toy can feel
Holding your head
You won't shout
You still beg
If you don't know
The Electric Co.
If you don't know.
Electric co.
If you don't know
Electric co.

Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night.
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same.
Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.
Life through a window
A discoloured pain
Mrs Brown's washing is always the same
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Do you feel in me
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
This love is like a tightrope
Hanging from my ceiling?
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.

Into the heart of a child
I stay awhile
But I can go there
Into the heart of a child
I can smile
I can't go there
Into the heart, into the heart of a child
I can't go back
I can't stay awhile
Into the heart
Into the heart

I will follow
I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see
A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found
Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give it to me
Just give up your eyes
Oh
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow

It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
And the boys and girls collide
To the music in my ear
Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying  
Take me home 
A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong 
Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home 
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song 
La lah la la, la lah la la
La lah la
La lah la la la la
La lah la la, lah lah la 
La lah la la, la lah la la
La lah la 
La lah la la la la
La lah la la, lah lah la 
Same song, sad song
Same song, sad song
Oh, same, oh 
Call out your name
Call out in shame
Call out your name
Call out
You better call out
Call, call, call out

Thank you
Don't mention it
I'm pleased to meet you
Don't think I'm very good at this
Let me show
I don't wanna know
I just wanna go (down)
F-f-falling... the world is by your side
Falling... did you find a place to hide
I just wanna know
I just wanna go
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
She said, the twenty second floor
But I said, I can't think what it's for
I just wanna know
I don't wanna go
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
I'm t-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you

Gonna push it, wish they got it right
What they call you when you're in life
Ran for an ocean, they running's done
Running for a lady at the speed of life
Of life
My question, at least you got it right
They got you when you're in sight
Running from the ocean on stepping stones
Running from a lady at the speed of life
Of life
On your way inside a mirror turning in here, in his hand
Love's still well if father keeps me home, it really is
I am higher, way up, fall

They stood on his shadow, they always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places, second-hand faces 
He saw but never knew
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She looked like a painting, a picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others, they call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
They met at a streetlight though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second, it felt like a year
He waited for her second tear
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh...
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Can you soar any higher, if you can't let go?
To save her in the fire, she won't say no
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh...
Downtown...

Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
You say how long
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl 
Boy-girl 
Finding out 
I'm finding out the things 
That I've been talking about 
I'm finding all the things 
That I've been missing out 
Finding all the things 
I lose my mind 
Sometimes fall behind 
You and I we live on the big ship 
And time goes by 
You make up and I believe a lady's lie 
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream 
Sometimes I scream 
Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl 
Boy-girl 
We go out 
A picture or a disco or a roundabout 
I walk you home, I hold you there 
You're giving out 
I open doors so I can shut your face 
Know your place 
Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl 
Boy-girl 
You can take me in your hand 
Stand back, leave me, come in 
Up and down and all around 
You will sideways to the ground 
Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl

There's a place I go
When I am far away
There's a TV show
And I can go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh
There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh
Sometimes the lady takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go
Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Stories for boys

Wake up 
The dawn of another dull day 
Take up 
Your dreams and on your way 
Oh oh ooh 
Daylight 
Mother stands in the hall 
Last night 
Head against the wall 
Oh oh ooh 
When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 
Stop, shake out 
They came my way 
Oh oh ooh... 
Boy, salute in a street uniform 
Toy, soldier ripped and torn 
Oh oh ooh 
When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 
Stop, shout 
They came my way 
Oh oh ooh

I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.
My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.
I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.
Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.
Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

Boy-girl, boy-girl

Mr. Burk is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr. Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
Mrs. Brown is off to town
She carries shopping in her shopping bag
Mr. Brown is working hard
For some degree at university
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It really is
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
Uncle Tony hates a drag
He didn't give me a lot of time, dear
Jack and Jill go up the hill
To pick some flowers and daffodils
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon

I try to sing this song
I, I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet
I try, I try to speak up
But only in you I'm complete
Gloria, in te domine
Gloria, exultate
Gloria
Gloria
Oh, Lord, loosen my lips
I try to sing this song
I, I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there, you let me in
Gloria, in te domine
Gloria, exultate
Oh, Lord, if I had anything, anything at all
I'd give it to you
I'd give it to you
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria

Julie says, John I'm getting nowhere
I wrote this letter, hope to get just someplace soon
I want to get up
When I wake up
When I get up
I fall down.
Julie wake up, Julie tell the story
You wrote the letter, said you were gonna get there someday
Gonna walk in the sun
And the wind and the rain
Never walk back again
I know you fall down
You're falling down
You fall down
You fall down.
Julie say something, Julie say you're sorry
You're gonna get better, you better not leave me here anyway
I want to get up
When you wake up
But when I get up
I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
I broke myself.
I fall, I fall down
I'm falling down
When you fall
I fall with you
And when you're falling down
Is when I hit the ground.
I fall with you
I fall down.

I was talking, I was talking to myself
Somebody else talk, talk, talking.
I couldn't hear a word, a word he said.
He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother (Brother)
Got to get out, got to get out.
I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself
And my reflection
When I thought about it
My direction
Going nowhere, going nowhere.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than he who will not see.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me.
I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you
Be my brother
There is no other way out of here
Be my brother
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get out of here.

It's falling, it's falling
And outside a building comes tumbling down.
And inside a child on the ground
Says he'd do it again
And what am I to do?
What in the world am I to say?
There's nothing else to do.
He says he'll change the world some day
I rejoice.
This morning I fell out of bed
When I woke up to what he had said
Everything's crazy
But I'm too lazy to lie
And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me
Rejoice
Rejoice
And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me
I rejoice
Rejoice 
In the rest of the world

The wind of life and air from above smells of death.
Angels sing of the end.
Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.
Human race prepares to die...

Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat, There's no one to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away.
AWAY!
Right?

I came here for something and I'm not turning back
Strong in the mind, but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience, but it means the world to me
You have the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death
I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees, forgive me please
Tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion
You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, right now,
Now you turn the other way.
You've turned away from me,
The future's much too far away to see.
I hope you learn the truth,
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you.

Darkness coats us.
The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
The chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.
True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.
Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.
Smell the burning embers, time flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.
(3x)
And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.
Smell the burning embers, night flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.
And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.

A living nightmare, asleep but still aware.
The endless torture.
The painless pleasure.
I grasp myself.
Trying to regain control.
I experience and learn.
In another faction of my mind.
So confused.
But everything makes perfect sense.
Can't feel the pain.
Emotional pain's so much deadlier.
Lost, you've just been raped.
Pain. Your friends can't help you.
Why won't they help you? Another reality.
This can't be happening.
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck. Are you?
Trying hard to figure out what's done.
I scramble but now I run.
The images in my head.
All the problems that I've been fed.
All the problems that I've been fed.
Punching slowly my mind can't change the speed.
As my victims bleed.
No matter what I do or how hard I try.
I can't use my abilities.
Use my abilities.
Art of Illusion.
My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
But I can not take their soul.
Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
Disappointment. Discomfort.
My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
But I can't take their soul.
Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
Disappointment. Discomfort.

Black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls.
Rain plays a heart warming tune, on the pavement.
Emotions stir.
A feeling of warmness, compassion, I feel at home.
Disguised by surroundings.
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
A silhouette stands still.
A cactus on a warm summer night.
But the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright.
Black as night.
Cold as ice.
Warm as home.
Ready to live.
Stars they shoot.
In a clear.
Across the sky.
As does my time.
Waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion.
Crying, breaking, loving, nothing.
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?
Falling down, breaking down parts of me.
Falling down, breaking down parts of me.
Fuck. I need this place to get away from you.
Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?
(3x)

The mark I breathe on you.
It's burning through your soul.
The breath I waste.
Losing control.
I bleed in pain.
Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from here.
No one's innocent.
So why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me (up on me).
Guilt. Tearing me up inside.
The innocent.
An evil in disguise.
The face of beauty to fall for.
I fall to my knees, deceitful.
Brought down by feelings of regret.
Again your mind has failed the test.
Not everyone feels the same.
Pacifist blinded by the game.
Stand tall. They'll break your heart.
Stand tall. They'll smash your ego.
Stand tall. They'll tear you down.
Stand tall. Scar your soul.
Break your thought.
Fuck your mind.
The mark I breathe on you.
It's burning through your soul.
The breath I waste.
Losing control.
I bleed in pain.
Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from this hole.

Your hazel green tint eyes watching every move I make.
And the feeling of doubt. It's erased.
I'll never feel alone again, with you by my side.
You're the one, and in you I confide.
And we have gone through good and bad times.
But your unconditional love, was always on my mind.
You've been there from the start for me.
And your love's always been, true as can be.
I'll give my heart to you.
I give my heart,
Cause nothing can compare in this world to you.
(2x)

So much time I've wasted.
I can truly say I never thought it would come to this.
Never would I doubt you, but the truth kept smacking me in the face.
Reality. You never stopped to think and you ripped us apart.
How could you? Now our time is gone but it's still breaking my heart.
Tears run down as I think of the days we've had, and the memories will last forever,
But you and I have died and gone our separate ways.
You are the one.
You are the wrong one.
Breaking the mold.
Going your own way.
All I feel, betrayal.
So much time I've wasted, and I never thought it'd come to this. (4x)
We had something great, then it was washed away.
We had something more, then I can explain.
I'm sorry. No! We had something great, then it was washed away.
No! Not all friendships last, the genuine are harder to take.
No! Time to start again, hope someday you'll think of me.
No! The end reality, I know someday I'll think of you.

When you see them coming in form.
And they say they do what's best for you.
Fighting for one total control.
They are planned and organized for you.
Breaking their hold. Breaking their hold of control they strive.
To keep you down, behind your back, the time has come, the end is near.
It's when you sleep, so late at night, and in the light, getting prepared.
It's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you won't exist.
They are the few, with all the power,
Our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out.
Screaming, pulling on our pride.
Stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise.

Forgotten faces.
Lost in yesterdays realm.
Drained with confusion.
Where did it all go?
Look into the past, look into their faces.
Never, the thought of being time fucked.
But now they're all gone and all that's left is this blank faced picture.
Ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished,
Coasting through life didn't seize the day.
No one ever realized that they're already dead.
By the time you realize, you'll be dead too.
Without another chance to save the world,
These things they're gone, you're gone, forgotten.
Now your face in my picture frame. (4x)
It's gone, forever.
Right before my very eyes.
And just when I thought I made light of things.
It slips away, into darkness.
My life passes now I see.
Just what this world does hold for me.
It's getting hard, harder to breathe.
Am I out of time is that what this means?
Well that's what it means.
That's what it means, you and me try to breathe.
Now you. Realize.
Your life, flies by.
Now I. Realize.
My life, I die.

I don't want to know.
And I don't want to see you in this place.
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face.
And I don't want to hear anymore.
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.
Get the fuck out of here now.
Come on you kids, stand your ground.
This is your show, it's your family.
All of my friends there for me.
There's four-hundred more of us then them.
So kick them out.
Keep it positive.
Keep it real.
Keep it true.
Together with my friends.
I'll be there for you.
(2x)
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my brothers, I'll be there for you.
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my family.
I'll be there for you.
I don't want to know.
And I don't want to see you in this place.
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face.
And I don't want to hear anymore.
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.

You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
No need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
Look what's happening now.
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?
You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.

No need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.

I see you fading away from us.
I'll miss you very much.
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams, and pride still running high, always on your side.
But I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
I don't want to see you like this.
We all tried to save you but missed.
I still feel the hope on your road.
Now come back to us like the days of the old.
I still feel you there, trying to get on top.
You'll always have my support, in my heart.
People you've hurt.
Friends that you've lied to.
But we understand, and that not (you) can see the end of the road,
I can see it too, for you, I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared.
This time, if you die.
I watch you, right before my eyes.
Just trust me, and listen.
You have no self control.
This will take your life.
Overdose and then indulge until you die.
Pondering, we all ask the question why.
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.
And we are left the only family that you've ever had.
(2x)
I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
Help you see it through.
Fight this me and you.
Reaching deep inside.
Problems not just you is what we find.
Our friendship makes it mine.

Wake the ones and rise tonight
Fallen souls we shine so bright
Rise now and ever
We command you
Rise now and ever
We command you
No one can touch us

I'll try, she said, as she walked away
Try not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting tested and secure
Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near
Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

(Give me your hand
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man, punishment too great to bear)
Conceived and born was one of light
Rain and dark, the other born black night
Raise your head and taste the courage
(The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight...
It's cold tonight as the clouds turn gray
And from my hands to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man...
Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go
Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit

With this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate,
And the axe comes early
(Only naturally) So what does that matter?
There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me,
On the other side
They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)
Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
(Nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype
Belief, structure built up in you.
I'll tear you down and the one who created you
If they didn't have One how would they act?
If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse
If they slaughtered innocent beings?
Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?
A good friend once told me you are memory
Without it we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I wanna be
Suddenly my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down
But keep away from me... keep away from me
(It's hard, to keep me in this place, keep away from me)
We may have created the beginning, mentally
We may have created the beginning, physically
To the end of our human existence...
I see through you
The fear that's in your eyes
A good friend once told me you are memory
Without them we equal nothing
All I can see is the place I wanna be
Timeless my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down - confused
I don't know the answers but neither do you.

Hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
Disappointed, we don't agree, I don't need your praise...
(Don't look my way for help.
From the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me,
I don't want your praise (we won't play your games)
Look down on me, spit in my face,
You're nothing to me... not to me
Darkened eyes you'll see,
There is no hope, no savior in me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care,
What happens to me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help,
From the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers,
You won't find them here. (we don't want your opinion)
And I don't want you. I won't let you think,
Compromise is near, 'Cause it's not near.
Darkened eyes you'll see,
There is no hope, no savior in me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care,
What happens to me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
You'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed
Far away, you keep on trying...
Holding me down, breaking away,
Trying to distance my life.
Not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
The one that could change your mind
But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time, and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, I won't soothe your soul
And in the end you're all dead to me...

Black enchanting eyes,
Cut through my heart
With no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
And cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles, haunting every step
And they won't stop hunting me down
I know the time will come,
When all around me's burned
And you'll still see me there
Asking where you went to
And what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
Cold out in the night
And calling for you all alone...
Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
They'll find you alone,
And your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
They seek more then vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
Burn for the rest of time
Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
Lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
And you're the lost mother they're calling (They seek more then vengeance) (Go now run and hide)
I hear them crying at night (Your pain is their satisfaction)
Outside when the planets are falling (For the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now run and hide)
Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
Eternal Rest... in time
Eternal Rest... in time

We keep writing talking and planning,
But everything is changing.
We all know what to do but no one does it.
Now this time has passed and full of regret.
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone.
When they get back, it won't be the same
My life, you've always been there.
Now you're gone and my head's spinning.
Left the childhood, left the memories,
Left the good times in the past.
Moving on... your time has run out.
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait.
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends.
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life.
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.
Never will I forget you, and all the memories past.
So rarely I get to see your face.
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us,
But you're still so close to me.
To me you were my life.
To me you were my soul companion.
Now you are so far away.
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
Come back - to the days when we were young,
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered.
To the days when nothing mattered
And I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night
As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.

Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awake, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb
No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through...
You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
No... This gun has stopped time in it's tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace
I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
Fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me
My voice has been taken from me.
The more I listen, the more I have to say.
You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
(And taste the blood she cries
And taste the blood she cries)
I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
Fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved
Building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me,
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight
So far away, I'm gone.
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide... suicide
I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please...
Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...
Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.
(Take back time)
I can see just fine, with you in my life,
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
Nightmare- full of pain
Nightmare- full of pain
I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll
Take away... Take away... Take away... Take away
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I care for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away
Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.
I can see just fine, with you in my life,
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow (x2)

Dust begins to fall, to the ground
The air is cold and thin
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
This will never end, When I'll bleed forever
Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
Outside shell is strong, Confident
But slowly eats away
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
Through my pores it seems to seep
When I'll bleed forever
Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
And why you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing
There's nowhere to run and hide
When you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house
No one's around
Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
But in my life, I wanted more, I needed more
I taste... more!

Lived through you,
Safe with how we lived our lives,
With how it all turned out.
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,
Will make you change your mind
Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right
When I see you, I can read it in your eyes,
Fate misunderstood.
(But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for,
Thinking with your heart.
Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right
I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know.
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be all right
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold so black so alone)
Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by.
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.
Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right.
Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation. (whoa)
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right.

This shining city built of gold
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye
'Round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The beast and the harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The city dressed in jewels and gold
Fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world
Sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky
The beast and the harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Looking back on her to see there's nothin' around
I don't believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set
Forever
She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don"t need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Whoa, yeah!
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day
The fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
(Chorus vocalizing) 
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Ha! Yeah, yeah!
Run from me before I tear you down (Be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (Despise what you say - Chorus vocalizing)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side - Chorus vocalizing)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end (Chorus vocalizing)
Sweet child we'll miss you
No, so far away, far away
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes - Chorus vocalizing)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Falling away
Can't buy back time
Burn it down anyways

And we're at it again, I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'
Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and
Everyone eventually will take the step 'cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right I feel the hate you've built
For me and I say pay attention baby)
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forget
How to speak how to ask all the questions
The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do from on the outside looking in your government is listenin' to
Push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell and your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to (run)
Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
You're scared seductive system
Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote and most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty
As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to run
You've fallen asleep here in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
As I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today
Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right
I'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die

Keep on writing you're just raping yourself (nothing can take my mind away from them)
Don't you ask about me, ask 'bout somebody else (Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can't feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far ya take it (Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we' re destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen (Resentment building, you've put
Our lives on hold)
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Play your game and walk away your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else (Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell (Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me, should make you worried (Long way to go and you're
Right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes sure you can't breathe (Pick at pieces of my body below)
I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar (There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right, I'll justify the means (Nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine
Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn Impostor are you out of your mind?
I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devils appetite is tonight and now I'm all right
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time
Play your game and walk away your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out
I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control
Don't try and get the best of me (No one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world keep dying, no more use in tryin'
And my body's trashed and low, but to you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And I've seen it all before but I'll settle the score, I'll never join your side

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I remember
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep this silence up
No, you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord

It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Well I wait in every day, just in case,
You decide to call
And I can hardly wait, 'cause I never thought time could pass so slowly
It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again, but now I know
It's you that I've been looking for
And day by day more and more
I know what you think, you've heard it before
Don't tell me I know
But this feeling inside my heart,
You know I'm never letting go
'Cause I think that...
It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Words can only say so much
It's hard to express
The things you do to me
You're everything I could ever dreamed you'd be
This must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love...

I held the book so tightly in my hands,
I saw your picture, heard you call my name
It was strange I could not look away
I had to be there, I wanted to go
You gave me no reason
You gave me no warning
But I was with you,
By your side
Give me the strength, so I can help you
And I can be strong now, they don't frighten me
It's written in the book
The sun is hotter than before
But inside it's cold, I wonder why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Well I believe we can make it right
It's time now
To show our feelings
Looking through you

Your heart's empty
Whatever happened to you, you can't change it,
Nowhere to run to, please, oh please don't let me down
But wait a minute I don't understand
It's getting stronger, hold my hand
Don't want to leave you I don't want to go
But I'm a' losing all control
Can't you see me I'm slipping away
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
Oh Lord
It's written in the book
I held the book so tightly in my hands
Saw your picture, heard you call my name
Oh, and even though we never, never touched
I keep waiting for you just the same
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la...

The roof is leaking and the wind is howling
Kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
I've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old
It's been months now, since we heard from our Mary,
I wonder if she ever made the coast
She and her young man, they both moved out there
But I sure hope they write, just to let us know
And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But Spring'll soon be here,
Oh God I hope it's not late
Ma and Pa lived here, and theirs before them
Tried their hardest to make it a home
Seems so long now since they passed over
Hope my children'll try to make it their own
The roof is leaking and the wind is howling
Kids are crying, 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
I've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old
And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But Spring'll soon be here,
Oh God I hope it's not late

So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own
I try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Well it feels like something you want so bad
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
You can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch
And I feel it coming at me
I can feel it coming at me
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again
I'm waiting in line, but would you say if I was wasting my time
Or did I miss again...

Just as I thought I'd make it
You walk back into my life
Just like you never left
Just as I'd learned to be lonely
You call up to tell me
You're not sure if you're ready
But ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave
Leave me alone with my heart
I'm putting the pieces back together again
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
I can do without you, know what I mean...
I wish I could write a love song,
To show you the way I feel
Seems you don't like to listen
Oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave
Leave me alone with my heart
It's broken in two and I'm not thinking too straight
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
You've taken everything else, you know what I mean

I never thought I'd ever get tired of playing games
But I've been holding back for too long
Now the time has come to get it right
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong
'Cause they said thunder and they said lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right
Never ever did believe in guiding lights
'Cause what you didn't hold, slipped away
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoe
'Cause things look like they're going my way
'Cause they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right
I never ever did believe in a second chance
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
If you played the game, you got treated right
Oh but I'm not playing the game, no more
'Cause they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right

If you feel it do it,
You don't need a reason
For all you know it could be good for you
To show your feelings
Don't just leave them
Do the things you believe in, it's all right
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here
I'm not moving... no really
You just try and push me out
No, I'm not moving... no really
No, I'm not going anywhere tonight
If you think it, say it
'Cause no one will stop you
Don't keep quiet, just 'cause you think you ought to
Feel free to shout it loud, speak your mind, spit it out
'Cause I'm not moving... no really
You just try and push me out
No I'm not moving I can sit it out
No really, there's no hurry
So don't worry turn around, I will still be here
If it hurts don't do it
'Cause no one can take you make you drink
And no one can tell you what you think
Remember if your spirit starts to sink
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here

I read all the letters...
I read each word that you've sent to me
And though its past now, and your words...
All the memories I've had, still remain
I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no one knows
Oh sure my friends all come 'round,
But I'm in a crowd, and own my own
It's 'cause you're gone now, but your heart... heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again
You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No, you would not let me go
Seems I was wrong,
But I love, love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away
But just remember...
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
Hoh...

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, oh it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is beginning, oh it is beginning
That love is all and love is ev'ryone
It is knowing, oh it is knowing
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, oh it is believing
So play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of, once in a lullaby

Well, you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play
'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
They don't care anymore
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway
I won't be there anymore
Get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Well, I don't care now what you say
'Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself
And I don't care now what you say
Hey I'll do all right by myself
'Cause I know
'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
I don't care anymore.
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
I don't care anymore
D'you hear?
I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
I never did believe you much anyway
I won't be there no more
So get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
D'you hear? I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
You listening? I don't care no more
No more!
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
You know I don't care anymore
Don't care no more
No more, no more, no more
Don't care no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, n-no more

When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
'Cause I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind
But I remember not so long ago
I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine
Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening, but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
'Cause I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine
Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna wake up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay
Oh, 'cause you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know.
Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine
Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
But over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay
'Cause you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
Chorus to fade

My mom and dad both say
I must be crazy to be this infatuated
But I know you know
We got something special never felt before
You get me going just looking at you
And the feeling's not hard to recognise so
All right I'll come out in the open with it
Will you walk out with me?
'Cause you're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
'Cause I know who I am
Your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars
You're just like a picture book standing there
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way that I do
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
'Cause I know it's your first time
Your mum and dad don't like me
And they tell me every time I call around to see you
I don't know why
'Cause I always straighten my tie and comb my hair
I know your brother thinks that
I'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town
I know he's got me wrong
Because I'm really not like that, I'll tell you why
You're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
'Cause I know who I am
I remember the very first time I held your hand
And that was the last time you were so close to me
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way as I do
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
'Cause I know it's your first time
I know you know and now I want to, I want to tell everybody
I know you know and now I want them all to see
Repeat to fade

You said you would, you didn't and I wanna know why
And don't make no excuses
You promised, you promised, you better explain
Though I don't know what the use is
You said you could, you couldn't, now why did you lie?
You made it look so easy
You did it, why do it, what was your point?
Laughing while you tease me
Oh, do you know and do you care?
I said I did, I shouldn't 'cause the magic will go
It happened once before
You'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away
And then come back for more
Don't say you would, you wouldn't 'cause I saw you myself
It's too late for your reason
You're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time
I'm sick of all the cheating
Oh, well do you know and do you care?
'Cause I watch you
Oh every day I watch you pass me by
I'll get you
Yes in the end I'll get you
Just watch me try
Oh you make it hard to be hard but I'm trying my best
'Cause down inside I'm burnin'
You want it, you got it, now take it and run
I'll hide how much it's hurtin'
Oh, well do you know and do you care?
Oh, well do you know and do you care?
Oh, do you know, and do you care?

I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break
Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
(Well now wait)
No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

Well it don't matter to me what you say, what you say
And it don't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right.
Because I've heard it all so many times before
Just what you're saying and
I don't really want to hear it all no more, no more
Don't wanna hear it no more
'Cause there's no way that you can run
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's nobody that you can turn to
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you
That it don't matter to me what you say, what you say, say, say, saying
Well it didn't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right
It seems to me it's been too easy for you for too long
So you'd better climb down before you fall and hurt your pride, your pride
You're gonna hurt your pride
'Cause there' nowhere that you can run to
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's no place that you can stay
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you
That it don't matter to me what you do
Well it don't matter to me, I'm talking to you, talking to you
Well it don't matter to me believe me
Well it don't matter to me
Repeat to fade

I can hear through these walls
I can hear it when they're foolin' around
I can hear through these walls and
I hear every sign, every sound
I can hear through these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down
Every word that they say
Every move they make feels it's coming my way
My favorite moment, putting the glass up next to the wall
Imagination, though I see nothing, I hear it all
Putting my sign up, do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out
Oh, when my clothes, they're all laid out
I can see through my windows
I can see the girls and the boys
I can see through my windows and
I can imagine the noise
I can see through my windows
I can see them playing with toys
Oh I hope it won't end
If I promise not to touch, just be a friend
Life is so lonely and I don't get high off just being me
I like pretending wanting to touch them, wanting to see
It's only normal creeping behind you, now don't shout, 'cause it's alright
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight
Ooh I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage no way in, no way out
And it gets so lonely am I really asking a lot
Just to reach out and touch somebody?
'Cause when I look through my windows or open my door
I can feel it all around me
And I can hear through these walls
I can hear it when they're foolin' 'round
I can hear through these walls
I can hear every sight, every sound
I can hear through these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down
And every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way
Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

You were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to tell you it'll all work out all right
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
You can look at him the way you did me
And hold him close say you're never letting go
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me
So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of the wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right
'Cause I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely
But hoping you could be strong
But can you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?
So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
Well he's gonna try to make it work for you
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
Think about me, oh! and don't be fooled by his kiss
And don't let him steal your heart away
Please, don't let him steal your heart away
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of your wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right
You know I'm right
'Cause you were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be all right
But he's no good for you
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this
And whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss

Why can't it wait 'til morning?
We can talk about it then
'Cause I've had a drink too many
And my troubles, well I ain't got any
Why can't it wait 'til daylight?
Things will seem much clearer then
I'm tired and my eyes are weary
And I just want you lying here with me
So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice
Well I don't wanna think about what we've said
And I don't wanna know why we hurt ourselves
'Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me
It'll take care of itself and I wanna sleep
So why can't it wait 'til next time?
'Cause that time may never come
Stay here with your arms around me
You're going nowhere without me
So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice for you

There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Oh, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio
Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Su--su-su-sussudio oh, oh
Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio, oh
Ah, she's all I need all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I'll say the word
Su-Sussudio oh, oh oh
Just say the word
Ooh, just say the word
Just say the word
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Sussdio
Su-Sussdio
Just say the word
Su-Sussdio
Just say the word, oh
Just say the word

We know you really only wanna hear
The things we like to say
But if I said to you please don't do it
You do it anyway
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel
Be cruel to be kind
When I ask you, what you see in me
You say our love is blind
'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Whenever I think I know you better
Better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything
Then you say, O.K. what else
And when I run away you always cry
You always over react
But I don't know if you know how you really feel
But you better know before I get back
'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Just try to remember
Now I'm the one you love
You told me, ooh try to remember
I'm the one you're always thinking of
You told me, please try to remember
Before I walk away
Remember
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday
'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say, yes
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know...

While I sit here trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go
I've seen all I wanna see today
While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
And it would seem that we've still got a long long way to go
But I can't take it anymore
Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off it will go away
Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off or look away
While I sit and we talk and talk and we talk some more
Someone's loved one's heart stops beating in a street somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go, I know
I've heard all I wanna hear today
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off it will go away (switch it off it will go away)
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off or look away (switch it off or look away)
Switch it off
Turn it off

It's over, oh yes it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long
She said it, and now she'll regret it
But if she'd ask anyone
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late
'Cause I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no
They warned me
Oh yes they all warned me
They told me now don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no no
Oh it's too late
She made a big mistake
It wouldn't be the first one anyway
Tell me how many more, no no no
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no
It's over
Oh oh it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long, oh oh
They warned me
Yes they all warned me
They told me, now don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no no, no no
I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna get me back, no no
I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can try all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
No no, no
No no no

One more night
One more night
I've been trying for so long, to let you know,
Let you know how I feel
So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,
So I can make you see
Please give me one more night,
Give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
I've been sitting here so long, just wasting time,
Just staring at the phone
And always wondering, should I call you,
Then I thought, but maybe you're not alone
Oh please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
Just give me one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
Like a river to the sea,
I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you
To give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn
Ah give me just one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever
Just give me one more night,
Oh give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
And nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
"I'm never coming back", I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Searchin' through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop until they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand, they never asked him why
"Get out of my way", I heard a shout, then a blinding light
All I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Now don't give up, oh Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, 'cause you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy
You'd better, you'd better, you'd better run for your life
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
I'm never coming back, I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh Billy

I know she says she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would
I'm not the only one, but I'll do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should
Tell me, who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
Who said I would (who said I would)
Now she knows when she calls me, I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
And she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
(Who said I would)
(Who said I would)

You keep on walking so you don't fall down
It's the same old story
You keep on hiding so you can't be found
It's the same old story
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran
You know why, it's because you can, oh
It's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
My friends keep falling and they can't get up
It's the same old story
Well one says white and the other one black
It's the same old story
And I don't know why you keep emotions walled up
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
But it's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Things can change, from a misunderstanding
Nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh
Makes me wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
You keep on looking for that higher ground
It's the same old story
Your glass is empty and the chips are down
It's the same old story
But I don't know why, your emotions walled up
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
But it's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Repeat to fade

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can 
Don't even try to understand 
Just find a place to make your stand 
And take it easy 
Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see 
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy
Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe 
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh we got it easy 
We oughta take it easy

Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her finger tips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight
Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye
She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon
Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman, she got the moon in her eye
Well I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother, she's been sleeping in the Devil's bed
There's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the nighttime till your skin turns red
Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

You scare me a bit,
But that's all right
You know when I want you
Most every night
And I've been meaning to tell
You baby that it makes no sense
Still I'm finally convinced
Yeah yeah
I believe we could chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove
Is right you're so much woman I
Believe we could chug all night
On the day that I die, well
I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
I'll be alive in a dream
You better listen to me baby
Cause you know that I'm hung on you
Till I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do
I do believe we chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove is right
You're so much woman I believe
We could chug all night
No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo
So long and dark and real
We're gonna do a little chugging
We're gonna do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman,
I believe we could chug all night
I said a yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Woo! It's only midnight baby
Come on and do it to me

Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?
Tell me scarlet sun
What will time allow?
We have brought our children
Here Who can save them now?
Oh, Weeping woman try to smile
Like the coming dawn
Most of us are sad it's true
Still we must go on
Love was here today
Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you faraway
Love is here tonight
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby
Just want to let them roll
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy
I'll tell you why
I got a woman who can take me there
The apple of my eye
Oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no
I love her so
Don't let me see that morning paper
'Cause I don't need those dues
It's just the same old murder movie
But they call it the news
I'll tell you what would be some story
And what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
That just happened to me, oh,
I just don't know, no, no, no, no
I'll never let her go
Every time I hear somebody sneakin'
Up behind whoa, I turn around
But I still hear that sound
And just when I'm about to lose my mind
Here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way down along that devastation trail
Well tell the Lord above
She's got a brand of love
That cannot fail
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
That's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
The apple of my eye
My inspiration, too
She's got a lead on my heart and
My soul and she knows just what to do
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no
No, I get so low, and my mind's about to go
But wait a minute, here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn, let the floods return
We will prevail
Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know

I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have
Been completely blind
So, if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this morning, and
I don't know, what I might be on
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would
All be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on
There's a train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on
1320 North Columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was getting time to leave
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on"
Cause there's a train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on
And there's train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on

Open up your eyes 
Take the devil from your mind 
He's been holding on to you 
And you're so hard to find 
The wind outside is cold 
Restless feeling in my soul 
Tempting me to get away 
But there's no place a man can go 
God, will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show 
No, No You are the one, oh, how could you be so blind? 
The devil prays on runaways 
He's never far behind 
The many years I've tried 
Now have been revealed to me 
Closer is the love you'll find 
Waiting so patiently 
God, Will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show. 
NO, NO 
Take the devil 
Take the Devil 
From your mind

Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his life denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is well when
All is really going wrong
The Earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And puts my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please
Ah, ah, ah ah...
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away

I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a million stars all around
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I think you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
But she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I bet you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
I get this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
And I get a peaceful easy feeling
And I'm sure you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing
Oh, I'm already standing
Well, I'm already standing 
Yes, I'm already standing on the ground

I'm just arriving in the city
And there's music on my mind
Lookin' for my destination and
My home is far behind
'Cause it's a long road ahead
And you can make it in the end
And I'm gonna make it with my friends
And I'm tryin'
It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's gonna take some time before
I get back, help me girl
'Cause you can make it if you try
You gotta lay it on the line
And everything will be fine if you try
Sittin' smokin' just a thinkin'
Is an easy thing to do
We gotta keep on trying for
The feelin' to come through
And it's a lonely way to live
You gotta take it, you gotta live
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying, yeah!
Got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Yeah I'm trying...

They were doolin', Doolin-Dalton.
High or low, it was the same,
Easy money and faithless women,
Red-eye whiskey for the pain.
Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will,
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville,
Two voices call to you from where they stood.
Lay down your law books now,
They're no damn good.
Better keep on movin', Doolin-Dalton,
Till your shadow sets you free
And If you're fast, and if you're lucky,
You will never see that hangin' tree.
Oh the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin'
For the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy lord cause
Nothin' ever changed
Till Bill Doolin' met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap, just bidin' time
And then he laughed and said I'm goin'
And so he left that peaceful life behind...

Twenty-one and strong as I can be 
I know what freedom means to me 
And I can't give the reason why 
I should ever want to die 
Got no cause to be afraid 
Or fear that life will ever fade 
'Cause as I watch the rising sun 
I know that we have just begun 
I might spend my life upon the road 
Just tryin' to add to what I know 
Then someday I might settle down 
And all my friends will be around 
They say a man should have a stock and trade 
But me, I'll find another way 
I believe in getting what you can 
And there ain't no stoppin' this young man 
Because I'm you and fast as I can be 
I know what freedom means to me 
And I can't give the reason why, 
I should ever want to die 
No I can't give the reason why 
I should ever want to die

Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shinin' down
Well, I can hear the night wind howlin'
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I can't feed my starvin soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control
There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free
All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again
I got me a friend and I think I'm gettin' out of control
Oh, oh, oh
She's cool water, her momma taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone
And if anybody's lookin' for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try
Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why
You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm bettin' my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm gettin' out of control

It's another tequila sunrise
Stirrin slowly across the sky
I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' round
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise
And this old world still looks the same
Another frame

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the Queen of Diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the Queen of Hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see
They say that he was crazy,
The kind that no lady should meet
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
He wants to dance, oh yeah,
He wants to sing, oh yeah,
He wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen
To the thunder ring
He saw it in a window
The mark of a new kind of man
He kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt if,
He knew he could stand with the best
They got respect, oh yeah,
He wants the same, oh yeah,
And it's a certain kind of fool who
Like to hear the sound of his own name
Ooh...
A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire throught the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the runnin', but now he's runnin' everyday

I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me
I'm the man who won
Woman don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
Ooh...
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
Some me call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me sinner, Lord
Some men call me saint
Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothin' left to gain
Outlaw man
Outlaw man

Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
The years brought the railroad
It ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows
And dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave
Go 'round with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell the dancer
From the dance
What ever happened
To Saturday night?
Choosin' a friend and losin' a fight
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

Once I was young and so unsure
I'd try any ill to find the cure
An old man told me
Tryin' to scold me
"Oh, son, don't wade too deep in Bitter Creek,"
(Bitter Creek)
Out where the desert meets the sky
Is where I go when I wanna hide
Oh, peyote (oh, peyote, mm)
She tried to show me (tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep at Bitter Creek
(Bitter Creek)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
We're gonna hit the road for one last time
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind
All that money (All that money, ooh..)
No more runnin' (No more runnin')
I can't wait to see the old man's face
When I win the race
(Bitter Creek)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo...

Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seats?
Watch 'em Duelin', Doolin-Dalton, high or low, it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women, you will never kill the pain
Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back
The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out and it' finally turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado (is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust (maybe tomorrow)
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado

Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day 
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf 
But let me tell you I got some news for you 
And you'll soon find out it's true 
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself 
'Cause I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song
Woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo 
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why 
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right 
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky 
You can see the stars and still not see the light
And I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this vict'ry song
Woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo 
Well I know it wasn't you who held me down 
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free 
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains 
And we never even know we have the key 
But me, I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song 
'Cause I'm already gone 
Yes, I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song 
'Cause I'm already gone 
Yes, I'm already gone 
Already gone 
All right, nighty-night

You never cry like a lover should 
Sigh when it feels real good 
Or see the sky through the stone and wood 
You never cry like a lover 
I thought I saw somebody I loved 
Sleeping deep inside you 
If I could catch you in an unguarded moment 
I'd stay right here beside you 
You never smile at me late at night 
Laugh out loud when we get it right 
You can't get loose if there's too much light 
You never smile like a lover 
I can't live with you baby, can't live without it 
And sometimes I believe in love 
Sometimes I doubt it 
But your life goes on 
Like a broken down carousel 
Where somebody left the music on 
You never move like you used to do 
Pour it out when you're feelin' blue 
Somebody must have put some pain on you 
You never cry like a lover 
(You never Cry Like a Lover) 
Cry 
(You never cry like a lover) 
You never cry 
(Cry like a lover) 
Come on and cry 
(You never cry like a lover

Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer,
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe, maybe San Antone,
Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone
Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind
'Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on

Tell me the truth, how do you feel? 
Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels? 
Don't feel too bad, you're not all alone 
We're all tryin' to get along 
With ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way 
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say? 
Just go along 'til they turn out the lights 
There's nothin' we can do to fight it 
No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain 
And we who must remain go on living just the same 
I once knew a man, very talented guy 
He's sing for the people and people would cry 
They knew that his song came from deep down inside 
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes 
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone 
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind 
Called him home 
My man's got it made 
He's gone far beyond the pain 
And we who must remain go on living just the same 
We who must remain go on laughing just the same

Cruisin' down the center of a two way street
Wond'rin' who is really in the driver's seat
Mindin' my bus'ness, along comes big brother
Says, "Son, you better get on one side or the other"
I'm out on the border
I'm walkin' the line
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine
After a hard day, I'm safe at home
Foolin' with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in
And says, "Hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been"
I'm out on the border
I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine
Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard
I'm stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
(On the border)
Leave me be, I'm just walkin' this line
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
All I wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
Can't you see I'm tryin' to change this water to wine?
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
(I'm out on the border)
I'm sick and tired of all your law and order
(On the border)
Say Goodnight, Dick
(I'm out on the border...)

James Dean, James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean, James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wond'rin' who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
You were to fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye, bye

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger
Six in the morning
Gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger
Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck

How come you love him when he 
Takes you for a fool 
He's only lookin' for a good time 
How can he love you when he 
Treats you mean and cruel 
He's not the best thing that you could find 
Is it true? 
I can't believe it 
Is it true? 
I just can't see it 
Is it true? 
Is that you? 
When we were young, we didn't really have a care 
You were hung up, I had a good line 
I never knew it then but, man, I was in love 
How could I know it was the right time? 
Is it true? 
You've lost that feelin'? 
Is is true? 
You might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Don't wanna find out 
Yes, I was so wrong 
For leading you on 
There wasn't much I could do 
I was a wild one, but I can change some 
If that's important to you 
Is it true- you've lost that feelin'? 
Is it true- you might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Is it true? 
She's really leavin' 
She's really leavin'

Move in, 
Can't you see she wants you 
She has you deep in her eyes 
You been wond'rin' why she haunts you 
Beauty in the devil's disguise 
She can tell you all about it 
She sees it in the stars 
She'll burn you if you try to put her down 
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 
Higher, 
She can keep you loaded, 
Feedin' you whiskey and wine 
Fire, 
The devil's on the phone, he laughs 
And says you're doin' the just fine 
In that big book of names I wanna go down 
In flames 
Seein's how I'm goin' down 
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 
Truckin', 
That's all that I've been doin' 
Ev'ry girl's a fork in the road 
Stuck in some sticky situations 
Feelin' like I wanna explode 
All this gratification and sick conversation 
Someone get me out of town 
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

'Cause it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go
Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
And I'm feelin' fine
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up
And ball tonight
I got a date and I won't be late
Pick her up in my '88'
Shag it on down to the union hall
When the music starts jumpin'
I'll have a ball
Along about 10 I'll be flying high
Rocking on out into the sky
I don't care if I spend my gold
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Break my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' close to mine
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' close to mine
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah

When my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger in our hearts
Memories that make my heart cold
However some day they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When they gave out eyes like diamonds
That would shame the stars that shine
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line
When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line
There may be others
That know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other
Could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me
I'm yours, oh please be mine
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'
The first, and the last in line

When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day
Ever since that day you came my way
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning
At night I'm still the same
Do you remember that wonderful time
You held my hand and swore that you'll be mine
In front of preacher you said
"I do" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed

My baby's long and tall
She's like a cannonball
Say, every time she loves me
Lordly, you can hear me squall
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
When my baby does what she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me
I get high every time
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll
Old Shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him Jim
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old Shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home

Ready set go man go
I got a gal that I love so
I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
I'm rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy teddy
Rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy to
Rock 'n' roll
Going down to the corner
Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby
She's the apple of my eye, 'cause
Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me
I dig that crazy style 'cause
Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby
Pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left
I shuffle to the right
I'm gonna rock 'n' roll
Till the early early night 'cause

Whether you're riding down a highway
Or walkin' down a street
It makes no difference baby
I'm gonna love you just as mean
'Cause holdin' your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Whether we're standin' on a doorstep
Or sittin' at a park
Or strollin' down shady lane
Or dancin' in the dark
Well I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Give me a cave up in the mountain
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven honey
If you are there with me
Well kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Baby I'd live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go be
If you were there with me
Well I could love you all the time
Baby, a jungle would be fine
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
And I'm asking you darling
How's the world treating you?

How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
How do you think we stand?
Well, I know you've made your plans
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The one I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
Well, how do you think we stand?
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
How do you think I feel?
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
And you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?

I got a woman,
Mean as she can be
I got a woman,
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me
She makes love without a smile
Ooh, hot dog that drives me wild
Oh, I got a woman
Mean as she can be
Sometimes I think
She's almost mean as me

Baby, let me be
Your lovin' teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
I just wanna be
Your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
Baby, let me be
Around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Just wanna be
Your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
Oh, let me be (oh, let him be
Your teddy bear)
I just wanna be your teddy bear

I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you
And, if I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me, and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you

Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
There's a moon that's big and bright in the milky way tonight
But the way you act you never would know it's there
So baby, time's a wasting
A lot of kisses I ain't been tasting
I don't know about you but I'm gonna get my share
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
There's a balmy little breeze
That's whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting
Why don't you start co-operating
And the things I say are things you want to hear
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone
Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
Saddle up and ride you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star
Ride. ride, ride, ride along cowboy
Sing, sing, sing, sing a song cowboy
Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine
Gotta find what lies beyond the mountain
Gotta rope and tie that dream of mine
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
If you don't call me baby
Then I'm never coming home

Hot dog, you say you're really coming back
Hot dog, I'm waiting at the railway track
Hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
Hot dog, I'm going to keep knocking on wood
And baby, I can hardly wait
I'm gonna meet you at the gate, hot dog
I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now you're coming home to stay
Hot dog, soon everything will be all right
Hot dog, we're gonna have a ball tonight
I've got a pocketful of dimes
It's gonna be just like old times, hot dog
You went away and every day was misery
But now you're coming back to me
Hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog, when you come walking off the train
Oh how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog, baby, baby, hot dog

I feel it in my leg,
I feel it in my shoe
Tell me pretty baby
If you think you feel it too
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul
I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room
Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor

I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

Suntanned, windblown, honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par, oh how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So, on and on it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel on high
With nothing to do but to give to you
And to give to me love forever true

Don't leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through
Don't break my heart
This heart that loves you
They'll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now
What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust
Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now

Have I told you lately that I love you? 
Could I tell you once again somehow? 
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you? 
Well darling I'm telling you now 
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping 
Every dream I dream is you somehow? 
Have I told you why the nights are long 
When you're not with me? 
Well darling I'm telling you now 
My heart would break in two if I should lose you 
I'm no good without you anyhow 
And have I told you lately that I love you 
Well darling I'm telling you now 
My heart would break in two if I should lose you 
I'm no good without you anyhow 
And have I told you lately that I love you 
Well darling I'm telling you now

I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on
I need your arms
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home
When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door
When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so
When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door
When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

Every time I look at someone new
Tell me why I think of you
Then you sometimes ask me by
You're playing with love
Darling tell me why
You left me all alone
To cry over you
My heart is torn and broken
There's nothing left to do
In my prayers, I'll mention you
When you're gone I feel so blue
Why can't I have all of you
Oh, somebody, please tell me why

Oh, if you tell a lie
You know that I'll forgive you
Though you say our love is just a game
And when you hear my name
You'll say I'm from a strange world
But is it so strange to be in love with you
Is it so strange
That I love you more than all the world
Is it so strange
I have no eyes for any other girl
Oh won't you take me back
And say that you still love me
To waste a love like ours would be a sin
Let us kiss again
Let me hold you near
And take me from this strange world
That I'm living in

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide
Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

You know what it takes,
You've got it, baby.
You are the only one I chose.
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
Only you and heaven knows
About my troubles troubles troubles.
When it rains, it really pours...
You shouldn't have took away my loving
You know you thrill me from head to toe.
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles.
When it rains, it really pours...
You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose.
You got what you wanted, now you left me.
That's the way the story goes.
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles.
When it rains, it really pours.

I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling please don't break my heart
I beg of you
I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
I you only say goodbye
Darling please don't say goodbye
I beg of you
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you

I feel it in my leg,
I feel it in my shoe
Tell me pretty baby
If you think you feel it too
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul
I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room
Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor

Jennifer lost the war today
You'll find her burned and raped
Through it all
She must have wondered
What have I done
But nobody really cares today
The world's a busy place
Guess she must have really sinned
I guess we're all just soldiers
She was only six years old
Left to die by strangers
Her family waits
And if we're all just soldiers
Is it so wrong to be afraid
Phoebe lost the war today
There must be some mistake
Say it happens all the time
And it's said and done
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed
Guess you must have really sinned
Morality won't help her
When she lies silent in a morgue
And all our sorrows just don't count at all
But will the morning headlines
Even say that it's a shame
What are we headin' for
Seen it all before
Silent on the ground
As he's walking away
And I wonder how many more
Everybody takes it
Like it's nothing at all
Jennifer lost the war

When we younger
There always seemed like
Some perfect mold
That we're supposed to be
But now we're growing up and
I see it's just not that way
Now I feel like someone's lied to me
'Cause I've been true
Made good for you
And now I feel used
I'm asking you
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be like you
Tell me now elders
What were your reasons for
Making it seem
Like you were so much more
If you want to feel good
Because of our accomplishments
Why the fuck
Don't you just do it yourself
'Cause I've tried
Man I've tried
While you all lied
So now just tell me
How does it feel
How does it feel

Look at my soldier boy now
With that big gun in your little hand
As you patrol this foreign land
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet
Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time
As you sit here all alone
Will your buddies come and save your life
But as the enemy appears
See your life flash before your eyes
Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time
Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
It's your life
Uno, dos, tres, quatro

Time has washed away
And now I may wonder
How did it all slip by
'Cause I always thought
We had forever
Future calls to me
To take me away from things
I don't want to leave behind
Like I'm slipping away
I can't hold on
Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home
Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home
Through it all
My mind still wanders
To the one who touched my soul
Though her road leads away
She's still my
True love
I could believe
Will is not enough when all those
Lost days stand in the way
But she was
My hopes and dreams my
Whole world
I could believe
I still want to know
Who can see for me
Crossroads tell me
Now you'll have to trade
Your past away
And find another day
So is change a friend or an enemy
Through what comes to pass
I'll find my way
I've seen it all before
But is the best you can be
The best thing to be
Some people say
You're just wasting time
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

Clouds pass over the moon
Like an eye that shows impending doom
Tension in this misty air
Souls pass into the room
Drawn in by a lost memory
You will join them in the moonlight
You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in death
Time passes like the wind
As we race to beat days dusky grin
Mornings just a moment away
Your body glistens in candlelight
As we all look on in fiendish delight
The ritual is just beginning
Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
As virgins and spectres sing
This madness will never cease
In the dead of night
You will follow
In the footsteps of many others
Who have come before
I will show you the altar
Your Aztec eyes, Egyptian hair
Your beauty bestowed upon my lair
I've loved you before, in other lives
But you've never meant as much to me
Never meant as much to me as now
In this night of sacrifice
Where blood is spilt
That will never spill again
But in your linen robes
We want you now
We want you now
You could never ask for more than that
You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in
Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
This madness will never cease

Mommy doesn't have a head any more
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor
Well that's alright, that's OK
She never really used her head anyway
Daddy called me a silly bore
Bet he won't say that any more
Because the way his body is severed too
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use
Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes
Watch my girl friend come to the door
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor
Now watching my baby's jugular blow
Really makes my motor go
Wrap a towel round the bloody stump
Take my baby's body to the city dump
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack
Beheaded, watch her spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes
All my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles
Use to be a little, but a little got more and more
Now I'm craving yours
Night brings bad dreams, bad dreams and guillotines
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Find another victim for my machine
Put him in a home-made guillotine
Blade falls, gonna need a casket
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket
Leave the house at a quarter to four
Come back with sixteen or more
Cause the more I walk, the more I see
I got a funny feeling coming over me
Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

In your plane in the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is no Vietnam
We will win in Iran
The President said let it ride
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran
Warrior, the time bombs
About to go
What will you feel
Will you even wonder
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye
The Captain said kill or die
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran
Great Satan
Our flags our burning
Soon America may find
Its young men in the sand
Where their casualty
Is just a number
In Iran
The President said let it ride
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you
I'll tell you no lies
When all is said and done
Does it really matter who's wrong or right
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
As I lie bleeding here I still
I still reach for you
A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes
Your eyes are open now but you know
It's still hard to see inside
When action and intention
Are two separate things
Now I somehow wish I could explain
Why we hurt each other again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you
A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes
Forever we've been
Trapped by our hearts
Trapped by our minds
I'd like to leave
I'd like to win at love
But I just can't let it go
And I just can't watch it slipping away
And I just can't let it go
And I just can't stand another minute
Maybe now someday our shattered live
Will mend themselves again
But now a million miles away
I still wish I could
And though I somehow know, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you

In this world of hate and shallowness
Where enemies become your consolation
And those of us who win the game give up our minds
I don't call that winning
Say this doesn't apply to you
But ask yourself first
What have I done today to win the game
And just what have I sacrificed
Win the battle lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel
Reflect on all our yesterdays
My own words choke me
Why were they spoken
Regret for the things I've said and done
Just can't compare with
Regret for those that I have never tried
So blame this world or blame yourself
It's really all the same
When you are standing on the precipice
From which you just cannot return
Win the battle or lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel
In the style of forgotten men
I look to my horizon
I see nothing
While thoughts of guns and desecration
Sweep through my mind
But only coffins and bones remain
As I look to you
The emptiness behind your eyes
Seals my decision
Can't carry on in this world of jugglers
Where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings
Your key to success
What kind of tradition to carry on
Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball Your evil ways
Have found their way inside me
Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball For a better life
In this high tech dog eat dog existence

Once I had a friend that I could count on
So I thought
Well so it seemed
But times of need are not enough
To prove your friendship to me now
Once I saw a face that I believed in
But a mask was all there was
So who wears the masks and who wears the faces
Well I guess I'll never know
But as I stand here alone in a room full of people
With nothing to say
Beer on their minds, and smoke in the air
Call them friends but they just don't care
Friend for life
Such shallow words for broken minds
Show me a friend for life
'Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day
Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
'Cause when we're together we just can't get enough
Or is it we just can't get what we want
Once I saw a dream, I had to chase it
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Who's at fault in this game of yours and mine
Well I guess I'll never know
But as I sit here alone
Think of the girl who came softly inside me
The look in her eyes, the smell of her hair
Call her my own but is she really there?
Love for life
Such noble words for noble minds
Show me a love for life
'Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day
Once I had a friend that I could count
Times of need are not enough
Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
Once I saw a dream I had to chase
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Now let me close my eyes
Because I don't want to see anything anymore

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy
In a world without leaders
Who'd make people starve?
The world that we're saving
Will always be ours
Everyone says, well maybe I'll make a difference
Thinking they've got plenty of time
But you're squeezed a little tighter everyday
Punished before you can commit a crime
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy
America, all of your enemies come from within
But you lash out so it is seen like some frightened child
In an angry world or the fall of Rome
Your demise comes from your own hands
In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours
In a world without leaders
We might have a chance
But we'll never see it
As long as there's
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president now!

I've been told that to get what you want
You just gotta give what you can
But I know for what I want it don't come easy as that
They say, "Look out, boy
Tomorrow comes and things will look better by then."
But I'll look out the window
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again 
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 
Do you think you'd sell your soul
To just have one thing to turn out right?
For the thousandth time you turn and find
That it just makes no difference to try
Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself
There's got to be a better way
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
Dream of brighter days 
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 
No way out
Same old stuff always drags me down
No way out
Never gonna get it 
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never
Never never never never get it

Hey Joe, 
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Hey Joe, 
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Said I'm gonna go down to shoot my old lady 
I caught her messing around with another man, 
Said I'm gonna go down to shoot my old lady 
I caught her messing around on me, 
Hey Joe, 
I heard that you shot your old lady down,
Hey Joe, 
I heard you caught your old lady fucking some other guy and you shot her down
Well you know, I guess that's true
I guess you can say I shot her her down
Yes I did, I shot her down
I took out my gun, 
Then I shot her down!
Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Where you gonna go? 
Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me, 
Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me. (no one gonna) 
Goin' way down south, 
Way down to Mexico way 
Goin' way down south, 
Way down where I can be free

In your plane in the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is not Vietnam
We will win in Iraq
The president said, let it ride, ride
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
Warrior, the time bomb's about to go
What will you feel?
Will you ever wonder
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye?
The captain said, kill or die, die
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
Great Satan,
Great Satan,
Great Satan, (our flags are burning)
Great Satan, (our flags are burning)
Great Satan, (our flags are burning)
Great Satan, (our flags are burning)
Great Satan, (our flags will burn!)
Soon America may find its young men in the sand
Where their casualty is just a number
In Iraq
The president said, let it ride, ride
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Baghdad
In Baghdad
In Baghdad!

Ah, fuck! Fuck fuck fuck!
I don't know when it got this way
I don't know how long she's gonna stay
Every week it's the same
In her room, that's why I came
Here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me
Some might say it's a fling
For all I know it don't mean a thing
Either way I can't complain
Ain't no strings, guess I got it made
Here I go, I go again
The little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me
Here I go, I go again
The little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session
I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me

We are one with ourselves
Don't give a shit about no one else
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
We are one, you know it's true
Don't fuck with us, or we'll fuck with you
It's a mentality that kills the best, we better stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
We are one, it won't be news
Hang ourselves with one collective noose
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down
We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa
Bigger they come, harder they fall, whoa

Hey you're a riddle
I say as I move aside
Like I really need your advice
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try but don't get a lot done
Living in sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes
When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright
Hey, everybody's supposed to be the same
So how come they're so lame?
It's like taking a fall
Keep on running back into that wall
Awake in a dream, get up and go to work
But I'm feeling like such a jerk
Like I said before
Little men come when everything goes
When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright
So you're a riddle
I say as I move aside
Like I really need your advice
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try but don't get a lot done
Living in sin don't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes
When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright

When you won't go along
Some will feel like you can't find your way
Heaven knows
Heaven knows I've seen it all before
Now don't get me wrong
I've seen many a life gone astray
When someone goes
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go 
Shut up and take it like a man
You need us to get a life
For your own good we'll take you by the hand
'Cause you need a little more 
Maybe no one will say it
Maybe no one's aware it goes on
All I know
All I know it's like going off the deep end
Could you make a decision?
Could you think for yourself and go on?
Everyone knows
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes 
Shut up and take it like a man
You need us to get a life
For your own good we'll take you by the hand
'Cause you need a little more 
Close your eyes
Look away now
Make believe while you can
So you'd best go along
Don't let on if you can't find your way 
Many more
Many more do it for you
Because heaven knows
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire
Your life's a throw

I've been told that to get what you want

In my own simple way
I think she wants me only
She said "Come over right away."
But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on her brand new face
Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic
I should know better than
To think I'd reach inside her
It's all a cloudy kind of daze
She's not so sweet today
She mocks me, I'm no fighter
It all just seems like such a waste
Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic

When you're feeling low
Hypodermic's where you go
When you're with yourself
You wish you could be someone else 
Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away 
Once you get a ride
Doesn't matter where you lied
Once you shoot it in
Doesn't matter who you've been
Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away 
You're reaching in
But you don't know where to begin
All your dance and song
Won't matter when you're gone
Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

I think I'm burning up inside
I think I'll take a little ride
I'm gonna light up everything in sight
I'll drive on by your yard
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car
Then another in the local bar
Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Tonight this 'hood will be a pyre
I'm gonna set your house on fire
I'll dance around the pretty flames
Such a wonderful game
I want to make a tiki torch
I'm gonna throw it on your porch
Then I'm gonna run away
And come back another day
Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
So many houses, so little time
So many reasons, I'm not a crime
I'd like to set you up
I'd like to set you up
Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Once you said you'd stick to it until the end
I guess you lied, they call it suicide
Now you're gone
What was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had
Johnny was a weirdo so 
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself 
I should have known, you went through it alone
I wonder why. Did you even try?
You could have come to me
I would have helped you see
You could have found a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had
Johnny was a weirdo so
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself
'Johnny's strange behavior
Was a tip-off,' they say
But I ain't no fucking savior
I'm just living day by day
Little things, little lives hanging 'til the end
I say it doesn't really mean nothing
Telling truth, telling lies
I used to have a friend
I say it don't really mean nothing
And I can't let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this, let it go
Once you said you'd stick to it until the end
I guess you lied, they call it suicide
Now you're gone
What was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had
Johnny was a weirdo so
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself
'Johnny's strange behavior
Was a tip-off,' they say
But I ain't no fucking savior
I'm just living day by day

When cops are taking care of business I can understand
But the L.A. story's gone way out of hand
Their acts of aggression, they say they're justified
But it seems an obsession has started from the inside
They're shooting anyone who even tries to run
They're shooting little kids with toy guns
Take it to a jury but they don't give a damn
Because the one who tells the truth is always the policeman 
Beat all the niggers
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D. 
The city of L.A. feels like a prison 
With helicopters overhead and bullets whizzing by
Martial law ain't no solution
Police brutality's just social pollution 
Beat all the white trash
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D. 
They say they're keeping the peace but I'm not buying it
Because a billy club ain't much of a pacifier
"Protecting your freedom", man, that's just a lie
It's an excuse for power that's more like an alibi
Law and order doesn't really matter
When you're the one getting bruised and battered
You take it to a jury, they'll throw it in your face
Because justice in L.A. comes in a can of mace now
Beat all the niggers
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
L.A.P.D.
L.A.P.D.
L.A.P.D.

Things are coming down on me
They never seem to let it be
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight
The pressure's building up inside
I gotta let it out tonight
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright
Gonna break it
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something
Cut me for the lion's share
It's mindless, but I don't care
'Cause no matter what I say I'm in another fight
Take more shit, I've had enough
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright
Gonna break it 
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something
Gonna break it 
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something

Look at me while I look at you
Seeing eye to eye we can never do
You try to tell me what is right
I may not know a lot but I know one thing 
If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just keep it your own 
I wonder why our world is ablaze
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say
I try to have an open mind
But your brain and mouth must not be connected 
If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just leave me alone 
I would be patient but it takes so long
I don't want all this misinformation
All the words that you say
Lean on me while I lean on you
If we destroy each other
We might save a life or two
A little sun, a little shine
Separates us both by forever and a day 
If you've got a vision
Then I don't want to see
If you've got a notion
Don't waste it on me

Ah, it's time to relax
You know what that means
A glass of wine, your favorite easy chair
And of course, this compact disc
Playing on your home stereo
So, go on, and indulge yourself!
That's right, kick off your shoes
Put your feet up!
Lean back and just enjoy the melodies
After all, music soothes even the savage beast

Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
We are the ones
Who are living under the gun, everyday
You might be gone before you know
So live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
Hey, believe it
The official view of the world has changed
In a whole new way
Live fast 'cause if you don't take it 
You'll never make it
So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means
You'll live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow!

Hey man, you know I'm really OK
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap
When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off; it makes me insane
Open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh ooh oh
They say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease, something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker!
I open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Oh oh ooh oh

Starry sky, oh starry sky
Tell me if you can
Why do all you favors fall?
Is this in your plan?
Every hour of every day
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself for you
Bible man, oh bible man
Tell me if you know
Why do all the straighter vein
Wreck upon the shore?
Every hour of every day
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself for you
Her love is like the sea
Crushing endlessly
Every hour of every day
She'll await for you
Every hour of everyday
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself for you
Her love is like the sea
Crushing endlessly
Her love is like the sea
Crushing endlessly
Every hour of everyday
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself
And save herself
And save herself
For you

You said you'd never love me
I said you'd never try
I can't believe this world is gonna die
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
You said you'd never need me
I said you'd never care
I can't believe this world is gonna end
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile isn't all that great
My fashion sense is a little whack
Got nothin' in my pocket
I didn't go to boardin' schools
Preppie girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothin' in my pocket
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
'Cause I'm the next big thing
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
The truth is I don't stand a chance
It's somethin' that you're born into
And I just don't belong
No I don't
I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Livin' in Beverly Hills

I thought that he was cool.
I thought that he was strong
And then one day he proved me wrong.
He said he felt one way, but acted like another,
He just wanted to fit in.
Bobby no morals (bobby no morals lost his edge)
He was all along
And he couldn't resist,
The temptation was to strong,
Now hes all alone
Trying hard not to look back
'Cause if he does he might regret.
Bobby no morals (bobby no morals lost his edge)

You want it
You got it
You flaunt it and
Get your feet on the ground
And love me right now
You like it
You hate it
You bought it and
Glued your butt to the sound
And love me right now
You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah... uh
You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah

Go with the flow
It's the morning after
Don't pick on, don't pick on me
'Cause I don't believe in a burn like that
I pick up my donuts for free
And when she come 'round her picture captures me
So get with the groove
'Cause it hurts me so bad
Don't trifle, don't stifle me
'Cause I don't expect to be torn to shreds
Every time I am in need
And when she comes 'round her picture captures me
And when she comes around
Her (???) joins the sound
Whoa whoa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa
I don't expect to be torn to shreds
Every time I am in need
And when she comes 'round her picture captures me... me
And when she comes around
Her (???) joins the sound
Whoa whoa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa
So get with the groove
'Cause it hurts me so bad
Don't trifle, don't stifle me... yeah
Don't trifle, don't stifle me... yeah
Don't trifle, don't stifle me, oh

Ev'ry night when I go out to the clubs
The wrong way is the only way that I rub
I stand there oh so still
I must be on some pill
'Cause no one wants to see that I'm alive
Ev'ry night when I go out to the bars
People think that I just came down from Mars
I don't say anything
This is why I sing
To get these stupid feelings off my chest
Ev'ry night when I go out chasing chicks
I drop a line, but nothing seems to stick
I fumble for my shoes
I sing the white-boy blues
A ghetto sucka gets some other dates
I don't say anything
This is why I sing
To get these stupid feelings off my chest

Hey, Neighbour
Can you give me the time?
It always feels like it's rock-thirty in my mind
Are you up for it?
Are you ready to run?
Turn it out and shout your way through the next song
I am only happy when it's possible
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
(Let's go!)
Don't matter
Any time, any day
Just come for fun and all will be okay
Poindexter
Nothing to figure out
Every line can rock so stop worrying about
I am only happy when it's possible
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
(Let's go!)
I am listening for a spark
Hold yourself for the good part
I am listening
'Cause I want to hear a hitch
I want to hear it quick
We're all diving in it
Right here, listening (?)
I am listening
(Ha!)
Commotion
Fills up all of the space
Don't you know I won't show if I've got my own place
'Cause I want to hear a hitch
I want to hear it quick
Hell, you can rest assured
Hey, neighbour
I am only happy when it's possible
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
(Let's go!)

Until the day and my Goddess away
For you under planet and feed you a pomagranite
And the snakes, wish to rape
The lady will be faking love
From a firey pit
And when the night's moon
Lights up a bright room
I watch you rest with lunar eclipses
Come up from a Goddess Of Love
Come with me Goddess Of Love
Goddess Of Love
Goddess Of Love!

Just two good old boys
(Everyone now, come on)
Never meaning no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
(What were they doing man?)
Straightening the curves
Flattening the hills
Well, someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will
Making their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow
Just two good ol' boys
Wouldn't change if they could
They're fighting the system
Like two modern-day Robin Hoods

Headache, you give me such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache
'Cause you're so uptight
Sometimes it's just so hard
To put up with you
I've come to rely on a pill or two
Cause you cause me such pain
Why does it act this way?
I'm so frustrated with everything
Won't you be nice?
Bring some ice for my head?
Headache, you give me such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache
'Cause you're so uptight
Sometimes it's just so hard
To sleep beside you
While we're in bed
I still lie awake
With a headache, you can be such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache, yeah
In my head
In my head
In my head...
And I don't know why

How can you go on this way?
A waste of every day
It's meaningless and sad
And I just have to say
That no one really wants to see you try
They like how you don't bitch about your slice of pie
I think you're a hundred times as good
Now what makes you want to stay?
I ask it everyday
It's not as if they had
Respect for what you say
'Cause they don't really want you to succeed
They're happy with the way you have a need for them
I think you should push them all away
Even if you stay and succeed
You will know that it's nonsense
And it doesn't wash off for a very long time
So don't be the one that didn't have the nerve
To stand up for yourself because you had to serve
Someone with some pretty dumb ideas

Ain't that bad a place
I was born that way
I bite my fingernails
Still got bills to pay
You sure know what to say
I'll put you in your place
Land of the free, I'm on my way
I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA
Stop at coffee bean
This is like a dream
Let's run across the beach
Mama, what's the deal?
Nothin's wrong with me
Still waters running deep
Home of the brave, dog on a leash
I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA
And God save the king
God save the king
God save the king
Won't feel a thing
God save the king
God save the king
God save the king
I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA
Planes up in the sky
There's a missing man
A boy who didn't make it

You know I'd like to think
That you've been pretty cool
But I have given up lying to myself
You know it makes me laugh
To see you doing well
But it never fails to leave me so mystified
I'd like to know I don't think
That I will ever understand
Feeling pretty good about the big success
What makes people feel, the need to get their fill?

I guess it's not too hard to preach it to the choir
When you show them how to sing it and they sing along
I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand
It beats me down a little further every single day
I've made a natural selection of course it's none of the above
I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand
I want to feel like I don't have to try and understand

I understand the need to feel love
But this time you've gone way too far
And now you believe that everyone's bad
And everyone's evil inside
I don't understand how you can think that way
'Cause there is a book and it says that this is all true
I understand the need to feel safe
But this time you've gone way too far

It's easy to see when you believe
That we're all so evil inside
There are so many that want you to think that way
'Cause there is a book and it says that this is all true
Yes there is a book and it says that this is all true
There is a book and it says that this is all true
Yes there is a book and it says that this is all true

Any day now you'll call me up on the phone
Say you love me more than you ever did before
It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home
Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
That we're waging on each other forever more
It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home
Say you love me now
It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home
Say you love me now
Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
That we're waging on each other forever more
That we're waging on each other forever more

Would you like some lemonade?
No, this ain't no minutemaid
Just today I picked them fresh
From the tree that I love best
Couldn't let them rot away
Like my father used to say
Oh, happy day
Lemonade
Long ago, I didn't know
Didn't care and couldn't grow
On my way in such a fuss
Passed the tree and catch the bus
Till the day I couldn't pass
Fallen lemons in my path
So with my mom, I now agree
And use the lemons life gives me
Oh, happy day
Lemonade
Hard times come to me

Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it
Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, Don't try to shade it
Beauty is naked
Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it
Anticipate it
Yesterday's faded
Nothing can change it
Life's what you make it

Listen, pretty mama
I want to be with you tonight, oh yeah
I know you left me
For someone younger than I, oh yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
Listen, sweet baby, yeah
I know it's too late to 'xplain, oh yeah
Why I can't please you
I got you when I was sane, yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
And the love you gave to me
Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
And the love you bring to me
Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah yeah
Down, yeah
Down, yeah

Bip bopping strangers
Downloading highs
Destroy the old god
Just pay the checks
Thank god breath of life
Has come to make us right, right, right
Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw
We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh
Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing
(Lead break)
We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh
Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing
Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw
Talk to our bodies
Say what you will
Without our numbers
Are we a pill?
Ooh, ooh-oh

Never before have I fallen for someone who'd go on and do me like this
You were the one who would always follow through with the ease of building care
For a kiss
Say you love me
Say you love me
Get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
And say
Betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove
Say you love me
Say you love me
You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth
(Solo)
You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth
Get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
And say
Betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove

Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol thing.
Trucks are tryin' to rock my back
To the place I couldn't keep.
I'm an a$$hole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground.
Take no prisoners, we're just visitors,
We don't care about anything.
Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol crap.
Trucks are trying to grease the wheels
So they can get laid back.
I'm an a$$hole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground.
Take no prisoners, we're just visitors,
We don't care about anything.
That's the way the modern dukes rollin'.
It's every man here for himself.

Everybody
Love your body
'Cause it's here that you got to stay
Take you chances
Find romances
But you still got your bills to pay
When nothin's on my mind
She can't be far behind
Oh, beggin' me to stay
Or pushing me to crime
And I feel so helpless every time
Mr. Taxman can you hear me?
'Cause I know that you got one too
Down your jock strap
Don't you talk back
'Cause she's still got a hold of you
When nothin's on my mind
She can't be far behind
Oh, beggin' me to stay
Or pushing me to crime
And I feel so helpless every time
That's what you get for being blind

Jamie says since you called yesterday
I have felt so swell
Come back, come back from Mexico
I need your strength I need your help
Hated me won't you put me through
I miss you both, can't you tell
Please let that be you
Knocking on my door so loud just like you do
Bring in a letter or two
Jamie you are my faith and I love you
Hey midge, what you guys been up to
How's prince is he okay
Mrs. young I think you're the best
That's all I'm trying to say
Please let that be you
Ringing my phone right now let the wish you were too
Callin' with some good news
Jamie you are my faith and I love you
You are my faith and I love you
Stand by my side always be true
You are my faith and I love you
Raise my right hand I swear it's true
You are my faith, you are my faith, you are my faith, you are my faith
Please let that be you
Singing my song so nice like you do
Humming along to your tune
Jamie you are my faith and I love you.

My avaline
Say you'll be mine
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
Way down yonder in the old corn field
For you
I've pined
Sweeter than the honey
To the honey bee
I love you
Say you love me
Meet me in the shade
Of the old apple tree
Eva-iva-ova-avaline

My brain is working overtime
I need something to ease my mind
'Cause as my thoughts go manic
I really start to panic
There's no place to hind behind
I'm freaking and hallucinating
Going last when I should wait
My parents think I'm crazy
But damn I'm going crazy
I can't help my mental state
No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way
I work into a frenzied fit
I bite the corners of my lip
I'm losing my appetite
My pants don't even fit right
Take away the the month old dip
Give me something for my hair
A fresher pair of underwear
'Cause if I was run over
By a brand new range rover
I just want it, I don't care
No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way
I tell the world to fuck itself
It's you who decides what sick or health
And all the people I see
That's making lots of Benji's
Make me want to puke myself
Start a brand new fashion trend
Those are for the deeper end
Sedatives and No Doz
And edible pantyhose
They're on your plate so dig right in!
No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way
I don't care

My Evaline
Say you'll be mine
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear?
Way down yonder in the old corn fields
For you I pine
Sweeter than the honey to the honey bee
I love you
Say you love me
Meet me in the shed
Of the old apple tree
Eva Iva Ova Evaline

My summer girl
She was my world
He's got her now
Charmed her some how
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I'll never be your type
All summer long
Feelings grew strong

All through the time
I was not blind
My summer girl
My summer girl
My summer girl
My summer girl
I'll never be your type
I'll never be your type...

Everybody, don't make me laugh
'Cause it's not so insane
In the morning it comes to pass
And there's no one to blame
I'll tell you
My weakness
And if you knew the things I say
Then you'd have to believe
In the spirits above the sand
And the man in the tree
I'll tell you
My weakness
If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay
I'll tell you
My weakness
If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay

Is this it, are we done?
Must we carry on?
Like such fools shameless fools
Is it finally over?
Why when I call must you take so long?
Maybe weeks sometimes months
For you to call me back
You're so naive (you're so naive)
You're so naive (you're so naive)
My friends were right
Should have played it smooth
Should have tried to laugh

Instead of being true
I feel so numb inside
As I rest my head to go to sleep
One more time
Though I know it's wrong
Maybe you should do mine
And everything is fine
Feel so naive (feel so naive)
Feel so naive (feel so naive)

Are you ready?
This place inside my mind
A place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Another means I'll find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That I can never find a way to reach
My inner self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind

There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me.
Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?!
Ball Tongue!
You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me.
Ball Tongue!
The rag I'm on, we are justified.
Ball Tongue!
Congrats you just fucked-up my make-up and shit.
Ball Tongue!
What have they done for me?
Why are you at home buried in your own self pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me.
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?
Ball Tongue!
You have come to take from your buddy.
Ball Tongue!
You have never been so funky.
Ball Tongue!
The higgle got sick of me.
Ball Tongue!
Ah the dick is fine for the day.
Ball Tongue!

Ball Tongue!
I've driven right by my friends.
Ball Tongue!
They've taken the take above me.
Ball Tongue!
And you're a psycho monkey.
Ball Tongue!
They've come to enslave me
Ball Tongue!
They've jacked themselves onto me.
Ball Tongue!
Your fuckin' gangster signs.
Ball Tongue!
They've come not to save them, but they take...
Ball Tongue!
Fuckin' death to fuckin' me.
You're all psychopaths.
You're all psychopaths.

Ball Tongue!
Berome's dead at the technodrome.
Ball Tongue!
You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped. But who was it?
Ball Tongue!
It doesn't of the rhythm of the damn monger.
Ball Tongue!
Never die! Never die!
Ball Tongue!
And then, the man kept kickin' me.
Ball Tongue!
He gets him on, they're cool.
Ball Tongue!
He wasn't dead and then they knocked him on the head.
Ball Tongue!
No more, he's rid of you
And you're a dyke

I 
I am confused 
Fighting myself
Wanting to give in 
Needing your help
Skin cold with fear 
Feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you
But inside I'm fine
Can you see it in me? 
Skin cold from touch
Each day confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer
I push you away
You tell me it's okay
I can't help but feel the pain
I hate you
Why are you taken?
I love you
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I lay with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?

Scream at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself, a cowardly man
I don't run around, trying to be what's not within' me
Look into my eyes, I am free, you're just a wannabe
Scream at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

Take away the only love inside you
I see your face through everyone
Inside I've just begun
You think I'm out to scare you
I'm only out to prepare you
For when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down
You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
And you're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine
Tell me why you never liked me
Tell me once that you'll fight me
Pull down and wait for the perfect time
To take what's rightfully mine
You think they're dumb to defy me
You said you don't, but defy me
You wait, you don't want anyone
Oh well
You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
And you're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine
You know what? Fuck you

You'd beat me at my own game?
You try to see what you got
Me ripping at your brain

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away
(HIV)
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
(HIV)
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay
As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away
I can see it's hard to find

I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck right now? I got something to say
To all the people that think I'm strange
That I should be out of here, locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To a world that never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fuckin' like it

Go
I can in every way 
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes at me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away 
It's so predictable
I can in every way 
Feel the stress that tangles up inside
Too blind to see
Emptiness and the sorrow of their lives
You run away 
To the cover of their pointless ties
You ask me
It's so predictable
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
Another day
Silence overwhelms my mind
Who's to say if I have the time or why?
Should I pray for all the hate to go away?
Another day
I can never break free
You wait for me
I crawl up to you
Another day
I'll live forever
Why should I?
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
Oh
Fuck
I'm gonna try (should I?
I'm gonna try (should I? (oh fuck)
I'm gonna try (should I?
I'm gonna try (should I? (oh fuck)
I'm gonna try
But I'm gonna die

I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand what you put me through
Your life's a lie
That you hide
Is it that terrible being you inside?
I can't stand all the thought of you
I can't stand all the things you do
Why do you try to justify?
You are just too scared to be you inside
Let (it all go)
Let (it all go)
Let (it all go)
Let (it all go)
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
I can't stand what you put me through
I can't stand even the thought of you
Your secret lies that you hide
Is it that terrible being you inside?
Let (it all go)

Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
You try so hard to be wanted
False emotions tears you fronted
I feel being a person relies on one thing, be yourself, let you come through
You're too afraid to really be someone who isn't false, who doesn't care to be
You're too afraid to really be, be yourself, let you come through

I would like to
Search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Search through these problems that haunt and taunt you?
I smile
While you're afraid
You run
While you're so in pain
Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears
Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears
I would like to
Search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Open your body and let me touch you?
Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears
Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your fears
I want you to see
The life you have disguised.
The world of things that hurt you 
Kept all these useless lies.
I want you to fear
Fill you on up inside 
Once I took you in
I'll throw you out next time 
I tried
You win
My life
Is rippin' your heart out and destroyin' my pain!
Go!
Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears
Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life

Pain!
Buried so far away. 
Into my life of nothing.
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
I am so high always. 
Burying my life so slowly.
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
It opens my mind to feelings. 
Can't face boredom without something.
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Re-entering my head, 
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me.
Can't you feel this pain?
Reaming through my heart!
Screaming through my veins!
Nothing I can kill!
Screaming a
Lie 
I
Am
Can't you tear 
My 
Eyes 
Out?
Can't you take my heart?
Away
To heart
Good-bye
Sick of the same old thing

Why can't I decide?
Why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind, 
That thorn in my spine.
Oh sure, it feels fine, 
Wasting all our time.
In the back of my mind, 
That thorn in my spine.
Wait! 
See it before my eyes.
Why? 
Do I turn away?
Looking all the time, 
At your face so blind.
Feeling uptight, 
Always the same fight.
Hey man now decide, 
Go ahead take your time.
Kissing all the time, 
That thorn in my spine.
Wait! 
You cannot see inside.
Why! 
Play yourself out that way.
Why! 
You and me always hate.
Wait! 
Weren't you my friend?

No pain? 
You don't know what I have had.

I'm so for sure.
Right now, 
I am yours. 
My sorrow,
I swallow!
Follow me!
Oh hell no!
It came unknown to me.
Paranoid, 
It's controlling all of me
Somehow, 
Terror so pure.

You came into my life 
Without a single thing
I gave in to your ways, 
Which left me with nothing
I've given in to smiles, 
I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now, 
I hadn't let you in
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
The sea of life, 
You're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain
I scream without a sound.
How could you take away
Everything that I was? 
Made me a fuckin' slave.
Your face that I despise.
Your heart inside that's grey.
I came today to say
You're fucked in every way
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
The sea of life, 
You're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my mind
You stole my life
Without a sigh
You suck me dry
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face

The sea of life, 
You're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my mind
You stole my life
Without a sigh
You suck me dry

I see your faces and I do not understand why
Each time I dream you're standing there right by my side.
Why do you make me? 
You take my pride
And in my eyes, 
You kinda rape me inside.
I have no place to run and hide.
I have no place to hide, which I like.
Some will look at the time I looked back into my life.
You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes.
Why do you make me? 
Remember my hate, all this shame?
Don't you hate me sometimes?
I have no place to run or hide.
I have no place to hide, which I like.
I have no place to run, so don't come follow me.
I don't know where to run, so don't make fun of me.

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin.
Gotta phat frown 'cause I'm down,
So take a look around
All you see is big black boots,
Step in, use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet, you want to live with this nigga to with a stick
Uh, but that's nasty, 'cause I got a Body Count like Ice-T
From here to New York I get them skins, and I ain't talkin' about pork
Your sly, you pig, dig

But your talkin'.

Ready to bring that noise and kinda trigger happy like the Ghetto Boyz
December 29th was power to the people, y'all might just see a sequel
'Cause police got equal, hey, A horse is a pig that don't fly straight
I'm doin' Daryl Gates, but it's Willie Williams,

Always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies

It's in the low rider it's a little lower.
Take a little trip, take a little trip, take a little trip with me.
Ah yeah.
Aww shit, aww shit, awww yep

I hate writing shit, 
It is so stupid. 
What's my problem today?
Maybe I'm depressed, 
Maybe I'm helpless to what comes out my hand.
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
I hate writing shit, 
It is so stupid. 
Why do I feel this way?
Feelings in my heart, 
I'm in way too far. 
Can't it won't go away.
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Before long, 
My song is dying.
Before long, 
My song is dying.

Ain't looking forward to it.

Feeling all that's mine 
Come right out my hand.
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!

Before long, 
My song is dying.
Before long, 
My song is dying.
Tell me now I want to know, 
Is that me inside you see?

Free.
Set me free.
Just set me free.
Just set me free.
Just set me free.

That's why I die.
That's why I try.

Living life
Don't you cry
My life
Pain is God
Many nights
Painful thoughts occur
Yell at me, 
Again I'm wrong
In denial
I tried to be your friend
I tried to be 
A good boy
All I see
A hate deep inside
Startle me
Someone save me
Now these memories
Fill my heart
They bury me
All I want to do
(You are not my real mother)
Is kill you
(Should I beat and stab and fuck her?)
All I want to do
(You are not my real mother)
Is kill you
(Should I beat and stab and fuck her?)
All I want to do
(You are not my real mother)
Is kill you
(Should I beat and stab and fuck her?)
Looking back
I was never ever right
You were my stepmom
Who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walking in and I'd say, "Hello"
But you would slap me
And you would make some fucked-up comment about my clothes
But I tried to let it pass
But the pictures in my head were with you
With a knife up your ass laying dead
So I popped some more caps in your ass
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch, never try to play me!
You make my life
Not so good
All I want to do
Is kill you
All I want to do
Is kill you
All I want to do
(You are not my real mother)
Is kill you
(Should I beat and stab and fuck her?)
All I want to do
(You are not my real mother)
Is kill you
(Should I beat and stab and fuck her?)
Wish! 
Ha ha!
You! 
Ha!
Were dead! 
Ha ha!
Now! 
Ha ha!
Now I know.
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Now I know.
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Never loved
Never loved

Come on!
Save some for me, it's what I like.
I wanna play, you know it's time.
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling.
Come on!
It's on!
Now see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time.
Once I cave in, what can I fight?
I can never win, my self I don't like,
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like.
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling.
Come on!
It's on!
You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time.
This time. This... time.
For me, inside. Put me inside.
Hold me, this time. Put me inside.
Come on!
It's on!

So you see I've gotten this far
Please give me some place to hide
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away
Life sometimes pisses me off
It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is gay
Give me some patience, so I pray
It's time to die, is that what I want?
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life I'd like to be really set free
Let me be me
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is gay
Give me some guidance, so I pray
It's time to die, is that what I want?
(Take)
Take me away
(Take)
Taken away
(Take)
Take me away
(Take)
Taken away
Something I get, I got to get home
Run, run, run, run running home
Where is my home?
(Incomprehensible)
(Incomprehensible)
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is gay
Give me some patience, so I pray
It's time to die, is that what I want?
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is gay
Give me some guidance, so I pray
It's time to die, is that what I want?

Don't want to be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just want to break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so rundown and
You're so cynical
Narcissistic Cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead
Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time 
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way is
Haunting me taking it's sweet time
Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days
Don't want to be rude but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through
I just need to look around
And see the light that has come unbound and
You're so cynical
Narcissistic Cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead
Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way is
Haunting me taking it's sweet time
Sometimes I hate
The life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way is
Haunting me taking it's sweet time
Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days
Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life 'til the end of my days

Well, now slow down, baby,
And gimme a little time.
If you want me hangin' 'round,
Gotta give me some peace of mind.
Oh, get down, boy.
Well, get back, woman,
Before you bring it down.
Well, now get back, baby,
Before you bring it down.
Or you can tell it to the wall,
Without me hangin' around.

It's been an awful long time since I been home,
But you won't catch me goin' back down there alone.
Things they said when I was young
Are quite enough to get me hung.
I don't care! I don't care!
They came and took my Dad away to serve some time,
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind.
Folks said I was full of sin,
Because I was the next of kin.
I don't care! I don't care!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
I don't care! I don't care!
Folks were out one night to put me up a fence,
And you can guess that I've been runnin' ever since.
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help,
And I'll keep on, I tell myself.
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!
Ain't no one that's 'bout to help, 
And I'll keep on, I tell myself.
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!

Some people laugh in the dark,
Some people cry alone.
Some people talk without sayin' a thing,
And ev'rything turns out gloomy.
Some people count your money;
Someone is countin' your days.
And somebody got to keep track of your mind
When ev'rything turns out gloomy.
Brothers'll make you look sideways;
Fathers'll make you look back.
And when you're done talking, you still got to shoot,
'Cause ev'rything turns out gloomy.
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

Late last night
I went for a walk
Down by the river
Near my home.
Couldn't believe
With my own eyes,
And I swear I'll never leave
My home again.
I saw a man
Walking on the water,
Coming right at me
From the other side,
Calling out my name
Do not be afraid.
Feet begin to run,
Pounding in my brain.
I don't want to go;
No, I don't want to go.
No, no, no, no, no and no,
I don't want to go,

What would you have me do?
Just turn and walk out on you,
And leave you standing there pretending I don't care?
When you know as well as I, that would be nowhere
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
What would you have me say,
After I walk away?
Would it be the end or just a second wind,
For the good old song that we used to call pretending?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
It's not the first time that you had me turn away
And I know it won't be the last time
But you've got to say it, you've got to
Should we make a brand new start,
Or are you gonna break my heart
And leave me standing there pretending I don't care?
When you know as well as I, that would be nowhere
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
It's not the first time that you had me turn away
And I know it won't be the last time
But you've got to say it, you've got to
Should we make a brand new start,
Or are you gonna break my heart?
Will it be the end or just a second wind
For the good old song that we used to call pretending?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes,
But you've been talkin' to someone else.
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago.
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago.
Your mama said, "Son,
Don't call my daughter no more."
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes,
But you've been takin' money from someone else.
Come on back home, baby, try my love one more time.
Come on back home, baby, try my love one more time.
You've been gone away so long;
I'm just about to lose my mind.
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes,
But you've been talkin' to someone else.

I got to have all your love
Night and day.
Not just a little part,
But all of your heart, sugar.
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.
Don' t be led
In the wrong direction.
To start this thing off right,
A man need a little love and affection,
Oh, yes, he do, now.
All right!
Looked here,
We got to bring it all down,
Start gettin' it right.
We got to stop this messin' around,
And keep the thing up tight,
Oh, yes we do, now.
All right, sugar.
Got to have a hundred,
Yeah, got to have a hundred.
All right!
Oh, I must do, I must do,
I must do now.
Oh!
Got to have a hundred!
Yeah, got to have a hundred!
Oh! Got to have a hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hundred, too right.
Got to have a hundred, now. Oh!

Oh, Susie Q

(Fine... mine... while... mile... real... deal... ring... sing...)

Now when I was just a little boy, standin' to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said, "Son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me.
'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you now, now."
And I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwoods bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh
Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh, Lord
Oh, get back, boy
I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwoods bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh
Born on the Bayou
Alright!
Do, do, do, do
Mm-mm-mmm, oh...

Bootleg, bootleg, bootleg, howl.
Bootleg, bootleg, bootleg, howl.
Take you a glass of water;
Make it against the law.
See how good the water tastes,
When you can't have any at all.
Findin' a natural woman,
Like honey to a bee.
But you don't buzz the flower
When you know the honey's free.
Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie,
But Lord, that ain't no fun.
Better you grab it when she ain't lookin',
'Cause you know you'd rather have it on the run.

On the highway thirty people lost their lives.
On the highway thirty people lost their lives.
Well, I had some words to holler and my Rosie took a ride.
In the moonlight see the Greyhound rolling on.
In the moonlight see the Greyhound rolling on.
Flying through the crossroads, Rosie ran into the Hound.
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone.
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone.
Oh, Mister Undertaker, take this coffin from my home.
In the midnight hear me crying out her name.
In the midnight hear me crying out her name.
Well, I'm standing on the railroad, waiting for the graveyard train.
On the highway thirty people turned to stone.
On the highway thirty people turned to stone.
Oh, take me to the station, 'cause I'm number thirty-one.

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your momma call
From the early early morning till the early early night
You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your momma call
Well, now momma, poppa told me, "Son, you better watch your step"
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your momma call
I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen-carat golden thing?
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your momma call
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your momma call

Now if I was a bricklayer, I wouldn't build just anything
And if I was a ball player, I wouldn't play no second string
And if I were some jewellery, baby, Lord, I'd have to be a diamond ring
If I were a secret, Lord, I never would be told
And if I were a jug of wine, Lord, my flavor would be old
I could be most anything, but it got to be twenty-four-karat solid gold
If I were a gambler, you know, I'd never lose
And if I were a guitar player, Lord, I'd have to play the blues
If I was a hacksaw, my blade would be razor sharp
And if I were a politician, I could prove that monkeys talk
You can find the tallest building, Lord, I'd have me the house on top
Oh, let's go!
Alright, keep goin'!
I'm the penthouse pauper, I got nothing to my name
I'm the penthouse pauper, baby, I got nothing to my name
I can be most anything, oh when you got nothing it's all the same
Oh, let's move to this song!
Lord, look at my penthouse.

Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river...

Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Chooglin',
Chooglin'.
Maybe you don't understand it,
But if you're a natural man,
You got to ball and have a good time,
And that's what I call chooglin'.
Here comes Mary, lookin' for Harry,
She gonna choogle tonight.
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer, Lord,
He gonna choogle tonight.
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Chooglin',
Chooglin', chooglin'.
(Primal screaming)
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Chooglin',
Chooglin'.
If you can choose it, who can refuse it?
Y'all be chooglin' tonight.
Go on, take your pick, right from the git go,
You gotta choogle tonight.
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Keep on chooglin',
Chooglin',
Chooglin',
Chooglin', chooglin',
Chooglin', chooglin'.
(More screaming)
Oh, we're Creedence!
Clearwater!
Revival!

Well, take me back down where cool water flows, y'all
A-let me remember things I love, Lord
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight
I can hear the bullfrog callin' me home
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
Shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River
Well!
Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
And if you get a-lost, come on home to Green River"
Well!
Come on home

Traffic in the city
Turns my head around,
No, no, no, no, no.
Backed up on the freeway,
Backed up in the church;
Ev'rywhere you look, there's a frown, frown.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
People keep a-talkin';
They don't say a word,
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw.
Talk up in the White House,
Talk up to your door,
So much goin' on I just can't hear.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
Hurryin' to get there
So you save some time,
Run, run, run, run, run.
Rushin' to the treadmill,
Rushin' to get home,
Worry 'bout the time you save, save.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
Com-commotion,
Git, git, git gone.
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path.
Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path.
Ev'ry time I get some good news,
Ooh, there's a shadow on my back.
Saw the gypsy man
'Way down in San Berdoo.
Said, I saw the gypsy man
'Way down in San Berdoo.
Five dollars on the table,
Ooh, keep me 'way from my tomb.
Oh! Oh!
Said, I got thirteen months of bad luck,
Bound to be some pain.
Don't you do no trav'lin',
Fly in no machines.
Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path.
Ev'ry time I get some good news,
Ooh, there's a shadow on my back.
The man gave me a luck charm,
Cost five dollars more.
Said, "Put some on your pillow,
And put some on your door."
He said, "Take a long vacation,
Ooh, for thirteen months or more."
Oh, Lord!
Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path.
Tombstone shadow
Stretchin' across my path.
Ev'ry time I get some good news,
Ooh, there's a shadow on my back.
Oh, oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!

Met myself a-comin', county welfare line
I was feeling strung out, hung out on the line
Saw myself a-goin' down to war in June
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed
If you see the answer, now's the time to say
All I want, all I want is to get you down to pray
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you
Saw the people standing, thousand years in chains
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same
Pharaohs spin the message, 'round and 'round the truth
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
When I couldn't even talk to you

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Alright!
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well, don't go round tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't come around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
Lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse
I guess you will know the tune
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh, Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For ev'ry song I've sung
Ev'ry time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh, Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

I went down to the station
Just to take a ride.
I went down to the station
Just to take a ride.
Found myself on a flat-car
Yesterday behind.
Pullin' out from the platform,
There was no brass band.
I pulled out from the platform;
Nobody raised a hand.
And there were no tears of regret
From my runaway train,
Train, train, train, train.
Got no sand in my pocket,
You know, I ain't tied down.
Ain't no sand in my pocket,
Never do sit down.
I'm just a cross-tie walker
Where the freight trains run,
Run, run, run, run.
If you see me a-comin',
Don't you waste my time.
If you see me a-comin',
Don't you waste my time.
'Cause there's more miles between us
Than the Santa Fe Line.
Run, run, run, run.

One, two, three
Now I'll tell you plainly baby, what I plan to do 
Say I may be crazy woman, but I ain't no fool 
Your daddy's rich mama, you're overdue 
Now I ain't the one baby, been messin' with you 
Got bells in your mind lady, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe 
Aww, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh, no
Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me 
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me 
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one 
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun 
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe 
Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy 
Are you ready boots?
Walk on!
Well now alright there missy, 
Let me tell you a thing or two
How about it baby?
Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me 
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me 
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one 
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun 
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe  
Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy
Ohhh, nooo!
Wooooo!

Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away
Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door means I'm
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Oh my baby's gone with the wind
And I don't know
Oh where I'm going

Goodbye, Tuesday
Goodbye, Tuesday
Oh, train

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"
"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door

Mama told me
When I was young
Come sit beside me
My only son
And listen closely
To what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some sunny day (Oh yeah)
Oh take your time
Don't live too fast
Troubles will come
And they will pass
Go find a woman
And you'll find love
And don't forget son, there is someone up above
And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can?
Forget your lust
For the rich man's gold
All that you need
Is in your soul
And you can do this
If you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied
And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can? (Oh yes I will)
Boy don't you worry
You'll find yourself
Follow your heart
And nothing else
And you can do this, oh babe, if you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied
And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can? 
Baby be a simple, be a simple man 
Oh be somethin' you love and understand...

Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto? 
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow? 
Well if you don't know what I mean 
Won't you stand up and scream? 
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Too many lives they spent across the ocean 
Too much money they spent upon the moon 
Well until they make it right 
I hope they never sleep at night 
They better make some changes and do it soon
Do it now 
Do it good
Well they're gonna ruin the air that we breathe Lord have mercy 
They're gonna ruin us all by and by 
I'm telling all you beware 
I don't think they really care 
Think they just sit up there 
And just get high
Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto? 
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow? 
Well if you don't know what I mean 
Won't you stand up and scream? 
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Well if you don't know what I mean 
Won't you stand up and scream?

Daddy was a Cajun, raised on Southern land 
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fightin' man. 
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor 
"Hey doctor, won't you check his head?" 
The only thing that was wrong with him 
Was Johnny Walker's Red 
He drank ole poison whiskey 
'Til it killed him dead.
It happened back in the bayou many years ago 
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow 
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor 
The doctor just shook his head, 
"Twenty years of rotgut whiskey 
Done killed the poor man dead." 
He drank ole poison whiskey 
'Til it killed him dead.
Take a tip from me, people... brothers can't you see 
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey. 
They're gonna rush you down to see the doctor, 
The doctor's gonna shake his head. 
The only thing he's gonna tell ya 
"Stop drinkin' Johnny Walker's Red 
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy.

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"
"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see
But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change
Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird?
Yeah

One, two, three
Turn it up
Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabama once again
And I think it's a sin, yes
Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
In Birmingham they love the governor, boo boo boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama
Ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah

Alabama
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
(Yes, they do!)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how about you?
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Sweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama, Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah
Montgomery's got the answer

Ain't no need to worry
There ain't no use to cry
'Cause I'll be comin' home soon
To keep you satisfied
You know I get so lonely
That I feel I can't go on
And it feels so good inside, babe
Just to call you on the telephone, I said
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say?
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more every day
I woke up early this mornin'
And the sun came shinin' down
And it found me wishin' and hopin'
Mama, you could be around
For you know I need you
More than the air I breathe
And I guess I'm just tryin' to tell you, woman
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah, yeah
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say?
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more every day, I said
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you
In each and every way
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you
Much more than just a piece of lay
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say?
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more every day
Ooh baby, I love, love, love, love you
What more can I say?
Ooh baby, I need your sweet lovin'
I miss you more and more every day, yeah
Ooh baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I need you

Well, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got, just got to come, interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine
Well, its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well, I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind
So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye
That's right
Well, "What's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers"
Is drivin' me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well, don't you think that when I come home
I just want a little peace of mind
And if you want to talk about the business buddy, you just are wastin' time
So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye
I said, don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishin'
Well, I guess that'll be okay

Oh, seven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes-a, every honky tonk
Along come Mister Yankee slicker sayin' "baby, you're what I want"
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Want to give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
Oh, nine thousand dollar just sowed the wind
But we smiled at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign today
Wanna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
Oh, Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I want to see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Well I used to wake the morning before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro, used to play it 'cross his knees
I'd give old Curt my money, he'd play all day for me
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whup me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two then take another drink of wine
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
Yes sir
On the day old Curtis died nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words, and they chucked him in the clay
But he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to do
Play me a song Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said you were useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues

Going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
Well, I'm going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
You know the hound dog make a music
On a summer night underneath the moon
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
When the hound dog start barkin'
Sound like ol' Son House singin' the blues
Hound dog sing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
When the hound dog starts singin'
I ain't got them big ol' city blues
Wa-ooh
Wa-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Go ahead pretty mama
Lord, just take that city hike
Said, go ahead pretty mama
Lord, just take your city hike
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life
That's right
Singing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life
Well, I'd wanna live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life

Thirty days, Lord and thirty nights
I'm comin' home on an airplane flight
Mama waitin' at the ticket line
"Tell me son why do you stand there cryin'?"
It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away
I've been feelin' so sick inside
Got to get better, Lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
"You better quit, son before you're dead"
Quit the needle, quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We're gonna take you away
Lord, we're gonna take you away
It was the needle and the spoon
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, Lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away
Lord, they're gonna bury you boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know

Call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well, there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me
Oh, and that's the way it's supposed to be
Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well, I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia, I don't know
Well, I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well, now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So, I can't stay in Georgia long
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load
Ooh Mr. Breeze

Well, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got, just got to come, interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine
Well, its true I love the money and I love my brand new car

If you want to talk fishin'
Well, I guess that'll be okay

Like a resstless leaf,
In the autumn breeze, once I was a tumbleweed,
Like a rolling stone cold all alone,
Living for the day my dream would come,
Never cared for school, or any golden rules,
Papa used to all ways say I was a useless fool,
So I left my home to show him they was wrong,
And headed out on the road singing my song,
Then one sunny day, the man he looked my way,
And everything I dreamed of it was real,
Money, girls and cars, and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa could see...
When I went home to show him they was wrong,
All that I found was two tombstones,
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong,
Woa it's such a sad song
First I got lost then I got found,
But the ones that I love were in the ground,
Papa I only wish you could see me now,
Take a listen papa...
Ooh I learned how to play my guitar,
Gunna be a superstar
*Instrumental*
...Play one for mama now
*Instrumental*
(Female backups)
First I got lost, then I got found,
The ones that I loved were in the ground,
Won't you tell me please was I right or wrong?
If there is any way, you can hear what I say,
Papa I never meant to do ya no wrong,
All the money, girls, and cars, and all the world's big long cigars,
Papa I just want you to know they couldn't take your place...
When I went home to show them they was wrong,
All that I found was a two tombstones,
Sombody tell me please was I right or wrong,
Lord it's such a sad song
First I got lost,
Then I got found,
The ones that I loved were in the ground,
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong,

(Ronnie VanZant -- Ed King)
My poor broke mama told me 
When I was twelve years old 
You eat and talk much too fast 
There's one thing you should know 
Take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time my blue eyed son 
Well you may never have his money 
But you won't miss no rich man's fun 
I can never give you money honey 
I can never buy you clothes 
But the way them women been lookin' at you 
Someday you should have both 
If you take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time and love them slow 
And if you play your cards right 
You won't never wait no more 
Well the ladies like their diamonds 
They like their brand new clothes 
But I was blessed with plenty of other things they love the most 
I take my time with the ladies 
I take my time and I love 'em slow 
And since I turned thirteen 
Lord, I ain't never wait no more 
I can never give you money honey 
I can never buy you clothes 
But the way them schoolgirls look at you 
Someday you should have both 
If you take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time and be my son 
Well you might never have his money 
But you won't miss his fun

One, two, one, two, three
Woooh, uh-yeah
Two feets they come a-creepin
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
Creeper think he got nothin' to lose
So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
And as uh man's reaching for his trousers
Shoots him full of thirty-eight holes
Mr Saturday night special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
They ain't good for nothin
But put a man six feet in a hole
Big Jim's been drinkin' whiskey
And playin' poker on a losin' night
And pretty soon ol' Jim starts a thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So big Jim commence to fightin',
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done-a pulled his pistol,
Shot his friend right between the eyes
Mr Saturday night special
Ya got a barrel that's blue and cold
They ain't good for nothin'
But put a man six feet in a hole
Ohhh, the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars you can buy yourself one too
Ooooh, here it come
Oooo, let me tell you all about it
Hand guns are made for killin',
They ain't no good for nothin' else.
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself.
So why don't we dump 'em people
To the bottom of the sea
Before some ol' fool come around here,
Wanna shoot either you or me.
Mr Saturday night special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
Ya ain't good for nothin
But put a man six feet in a hole
Ooooo, Mr saturday night special
And I'd like to tell you what you could do with it too

(Ronnie VanZant - Gary Rossington - Al Kooper)
Cheatin' woman make you crazy
Cheatin' woman make you a fool
She'll leave your heart so lonely
Brother there's nothin' you can do
Well I can't stand the pain no more
She don't want my love for sure
She don't even want poor me
Knockin' on her front door
Why did you make me love you sister
When you knew you was untrue
You loved every man with pants on
Yes a dozen to you is too few
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world
Then you won't bother poor me
You won't bother poor me no longer
Cheatin' woman -- gonna shoot ya
Oh woman why you do me
Oh Lord the way you do
I done everything I can baby
Seems like nothin' reaches you
I'm gonna get that pistol gal
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals
You ain't gonna bother poor me
You won't bother poor me no longer

I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hanging around
So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train
I'm a hobo I know, but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away
I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock 'n' roll and I think that's fine
But I wnta to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)
New York City is a thousand miles away
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's OK
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down
'Cause they don't need a man like me in town
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's all right, that's OK by me
'Cause that's the way that it was meant to be
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
I don't like smoke chokin' up my air
And some of those city folks well they don't care
I don't like cars buzzing around
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
Well, I don't want to even read about it
Let me tell you something, let me tell you true
What's right for me might not be right for you
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine
And I hope that your happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's all right, that's OK by me
'Cause that's the way that it was supposed to be

Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
Let me tell ya, ... I said
Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
Ooh, that's my way, baby
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city
I don't want to read about it...

(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)
I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Wanna go uptown
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt
I know lady
People gonna talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-falutin' society people
I don't care if they don't undertand
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride

(Allen collins - ronnie vanzant)
I recall when I used to come home never had a dime
But lord I always had a good time
And I recall drinkin' wine with one of my friends
Lord, I can't go back again
Am I losin' my own way back home
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known
Am I losin' won't you tell me how I've sinned
Why am I losin one of my bets friends
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well
It goes to show lord you just can't tell
Now my friend won't talk to me let me tell you why
He thinks I 've changed because of a dollar sign
And it's so strange when you get just a little money
Your so called friends want to act just a little funny
They'll blame you
But I'm not the one that's here to blame
It's you my friend that's really changed
It's a shame, such a shame
Am I losin' once again
Why these things happen, lord I don't understand
But lord it can sure hurt a man
Why my friend won't take me as I am
'Cause your friend lord is the most important thing

I'm reckless and feelin' no pain
You know I've got no need to control
Livin' with the danger
I'm always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
And you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
'Cause it's comin' from my heart
I lead a reckless life
And I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only vice
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Hey, hey - yeah!

She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!

You pack your bags
And you move to the city
There's somethin' missin' here at home
You fix your hair
And you're lookin' real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You're always fightin'
With your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
You stole your mama's car
And your daddy's plastic credit card
You're sixteen and you can't get a job
You're not goin' very far
You're always ridin'
With the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Right to the city
Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!
You're on the streets
And it ain't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees!
I'm always buyin'
With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Oh right to the city
With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya, honey, how it feels

And losin' touch with all that's real
Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you been-Ooh yeah
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with mama kin!
You always got your tail on the wag
Spittin' fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
'Cause someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy livin' like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You got to say 'shit'
But don't forget to drop me a line
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth
With his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You'll have to climb back on the wagon
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no
It ain't easy livin' like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind

The way I see it
You got to say 'shit'
But don't forget to drop me a line
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth

You'll have to climb back on the wagon
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me
Oh, ow, ow, ow, yeah! -ow

Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Feelin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight, look out

Well I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother 
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine 
Been drinkin' gasoline
An' honey you can make my motor hum 
Well, I got one chance left
In a nine life cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go 
I smoke my cigarette with style 
An' I can tell you honey 
You can make my money tonight
Wake up late, honey put on your clothes
Take your credit card to the liquor store 
Well, that's one for you and two for me by tonight

I'll be loaded like a freight train 
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Feelin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight

I'm on the nightrain 
Bottoms up 
I'm on the nightrain 
Fill my cup 
I'm on the nightrain 
Ready to crash and burn 
I never learn 
I'm on the nightrain 
I love that stuff 
I'm on the nightrain 
And I can never get enough 
I'm on the nightrain 
Never to return, no

Loaded like a freight train 
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Speedin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight

I'm on the nightrain 
An' I'm lookin' for some 
I'm on the nightrain 
So's I can leave this slum
I'm on the nightrain 
And I'm ready to crash and burn 
Nightrain 
Bottoms up 
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup 
I'm on the nightrain
Uh, uh, uh, oh yeah 
I'm on the nightrain
Love that stuff 
I'm on the nightrain
An I can never get enough
Ridin' the nightrain 
I guess I 
I guess, I guess, I guess I never learn
On the Nightrain 
Float me home 
Ooh, I'm on the nightrain 
Ridin' the nightrain
Never to return
Nightrain

Been hidin' out and layin' low 
It's nothing new to me 
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
They break down the doors and they rape my rights but
They won't touch me 
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes 
They won't touch me 
'Cause I got somethin' 've been buildin' up inside 
For so fuckin' long 
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And ev'rytime you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed 
They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me 
I lose my head, I close my eyes 
They won't touch me 
'Cause I got somethin' I've been buildin' up inside 
I'm already gone
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
They won't break me
No, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, oh, no, no, no
Let me see you try
Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree
They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
I'm fuckin' innocent 
They won't break me
They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
'Cause I'm innocent 
So you can suck me 
Take that one to heart

I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin', no
'Cause worryin's a waste of my... time 
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man, he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
We been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone, never
Oh, leave me alone
Stuck it in the bindle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove me outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I, I leave it all behind
Yowsa

Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she's underground
So you stay out late at night 
And you do your coke for free 
Drivin' your friends crazy 
With your life's insanity 
Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Look out
Sowin' all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early 
And this hotel wasn't free 
So party till your connection calls 
Honey, I'll return the key
Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle 
Well, well, well, you never can tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle 
Everyone needs love 
You know that it's true 
Someday you'll find someone 
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone 
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own 
But till then you better
Now you're clean and so discreet
I won't say a word 
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin'
We both know money burns
Honey don't stop tryin'
And you'll get what you deserve
Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by
Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Oh oh yeah
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh, sweet love of mine

But honey you're a bit obscene
I see you standing, standing on your own 
It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be 
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend 
I'll be here standing until the bitter end 
No one needs the sorrow 
No one needs the pain 
I hate to see you 
Walking out there, out in the rain
So don't chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm 
Of those that take you 
Leave you strung out much too far, baby, yeah
Woah, no, woah, woah, baby, yeah
Don't ever leave me 
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted 
Was for you to know that I care

I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
Cars are crashin' every night
I drink and drive, everything's in sight
I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night
Now it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you, you fall down, huh
I see you standin' there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off?
You get nothin' for nothin'
If that's what ya do
Turn around bitch, I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do
And I'm bored
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me
So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money but it goes to show
It's so easy
So fuckin' easy
It's so easy
So damn easy
It's so easy
Oh, so fuckin' easy
It's so easy
Hell, so easy
It's so easy
So fuckin' easy
It's so easy
Yeah

Took my chances carelessly
Choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
But you ain't seen the worst yet
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead
Who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Wrote my changes helplessly
Yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets
Living like a lemon ain't so hot
And you ain't my idea
Of one high-rollin' shot
No I ain't standing, never standing
Big dark clouds hanging over your head
Hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead, who is out all right
Now I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing

You pack your bags
And you move to the city
There's somethin' missin' here at home
You fix your hair
And you're lookin' real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You're always fightin'
With your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
You stole your mama's car
And your daddy's plastic credit card
You're sixteen and you can't get a job
You're not goin' very far
You're always ridin'
With the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Right to the city
Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!
You're on the streets
And it ain't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees!
I'm always buyin'
With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began
You gotta move, You gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move
Oh right to the city
With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty!
Come on and hit me!

Mama, take this badge from me

Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey hey yeah
You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation jack 'cause it's just you against your tattered libido, the bank and the mortician, forever, man, and it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all
Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman
Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one to turn
Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by
Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Oh oh yeah
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh, sweet love of mine
(Where do we go?)
(Where do we go now?)
(Where do we go?)
Mm, where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Mm, where do we go now?
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ahh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go now?
Now now now now now now now
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine

I'm reckless and feelin' no pain
You know I've got no need to control
Livin' with the danger
I'm always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
And you know I know my part
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Livin' like this never ever
Tore my life apart
I know how to maintain
'Cause it's comin' from my heart
I lead a reckless life
And I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only vice
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Reckless life
I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life
And you know it's my only...
Hey, hey - yeah!

She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with
A flick and a spoon
And in the streets the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big
You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I bet you mama said
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys!

All we need is, just a little patience
Said sugar, make it slow, and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience 
(Patience) Mmm, yeah

If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
Sometimes, I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
But you know love, there's one more thing to consider
Said woman, take it slow, and things will be just fine
You and I'll just, use a little patience
Said sugar, take the time, 'cause the lights are shining bright

And I can still hear her complain

1,2,1,2,3,4
(Whistle)
Guess I needed sometime to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to Sixth and L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and Niggers, that's right
Get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your
Gold chains today
I don't need no bracelets
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket; 'til then
Won't you cut me some slack ?
You're one in a million
Yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, much too high,
Much too high, yes, ow !
Immigrants and faggots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran,
Or spread some fuckin' disease
They talk so many goddamn ways
It's all Greek to me
Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to an end, I
I keep it movin' along
You're one in a million
Oo, you're a shooting star
You're one in a million, babe
You know that you are
Maybe someday we'll see you, Oo
Oh, Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, Oo, much too high
Yeah,
Much too high, huh, no, no, oh
Ow!
Radicals and Racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Just tryin' to make ends meet
Don't need your religion
Don't watch that much TV
Just makin' my livin', baby
Well that's enough for me
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high, ow, much too high,
Much too high, much too high
Yeah, yeee, yeah, yeee, high !
Ow! Much too high
(Oh, much too high, ah,
Much too high, ah, much too high
Much too high, ow, much too high)

She's got her halo and wings
Hidden under his eyes
But she's an angel for sure
She just can't stop telling lies
But it's too late for his love
Already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke
And she is not coming back
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Yeah, she's got a criminal mind
He's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun
He's got to hold everyday
Now he just wants to wake up
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'Cause she's an angel for sure
But that remains to be seen
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
And without her, it's not the same
But it's alright
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
They keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Again and again

Send me away, oh
I'm here on my own
Hammer, stutter now
Let's rock, let's roll now
She says I'm obsessed
I say I'm in love
Oh, me
You've done it now
Now send me a way out
I feel insecure
And desperate
But not right now
I feel it now
And you don't see
The way I see
I've got it now
I'm desperate
Desperate
Desperate
I'm better off like this
I'm better off 
I'm better off like this
Don't you know I care?
No, no
Desperate
Desperate
Desperate
Desperate
I'm better off like this
I'm better off 
I'm better off like this
Don't you know I care?
No, no
I wish I was myself
Again
I wish I was myself
Again.

Comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I never
I never
I never
I never

Pick you up, later on
What to do? It doesn't matter 
'Cause you get what you want
Through and through and if you shatter 
Everything that we've got
Will you call me on occasion?
If you like it or not, oh no
So turn it up, take me down
From the wall, it doesn't matter
'Cause you get what you want 
After all and now you've shattered 
Everything that we had 
And you call me on occasion 
Just to see how I am
I'm hanging in
But now time teaches me 
To pretend it doesn't matter
'Cause you get what you want 
In the end and now you've shattered everything
He looks a bit like me
Replaceable
It's cynical
Call me useless, just you wait
Put me down and call it fate
Broken bridges, wasted hate
So just stand beside your man
The boy ain't wrong 
Act like I never turned you on
All I do is cry
December finds you all alone
You call me on the telephone
Who'd have thought that you'd regret
All those evil things you said
Now as friends, we say goodbye
I think there's something in my eye
Replaceable
It's cynical
Call me useless, just you wait
Put me down and call it fate
Broken bridges, wasted hate
So just stand beside your man
The boy ain't wrong
Act like I never turned you on
All I do is cry
And you watched me die at least a thousand times
But it's great to hear you're doing fine
Tonight, too late to fight
But you've got inside this naive head of mine
Now time goes by
You knew you would
You knew you would
I need to understand
Replaceable

We took a walk that night but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go so let me know if it's all right
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I never let her go
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
And then you whisper in my ear
"I know what you're doing here"
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh

Comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I never
I never
I never
I never

Save some face
You know you've only got one
Change your ways
While you're young
Boy
One day you'll be a man
Oh, girl
He'll help you understand
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Looking back
At sunsets on the Eastside
We lost track
Of the time
Dreams
Aren't what they used to be
Some things
Slide by so carelessly
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Oh no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Breakin' my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes, but don't blink, you might miss
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said a-heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Hoo hoo)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
Ready, let's roll onto something new
Takin' its toll then I'm leaving without you
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said a-heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Hoo hoo)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, a-rushing around
Pace yourself for me (For me)
I said maybe, baby, please (Please)
But I just don't know now (Maybe, baby)
When all I want to do is try
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, a-rushing around
Now somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, a-rushing around
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, a-rushing around

When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know you know, no you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no no no no
Help me out
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
These changes ain't changin' me
The gold-hearted boy I used to be
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
(I got soul, but) I got soul, but I'm not a soldier (I'm not a soldier)
I got soul, but (I got soul, but) I'm not a soldier (I'm not a soldier)
I got soul, but (I got soul, but) I'm not a soldier (I'm not a soldier)
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
(Time, truth and hearts)
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
Over and in, last call for sin
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done
All these things that I've done
(Time, truth and hearts)
If you can hold on
If you can hold on

One, two
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the mats with the boys you think you're alone
With the pain that you drained from love
In a car with a girl
Promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
Get down
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the streets such a sweet face jump in town
In the staffroom, the verdict is in
In a car with a girl
Promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes
In nobody's eyes but mine

Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ in some other town
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waiting this whole night
But I've been down
Across a road or two
But now I've found
The velvet sun that shines on me and you
In the back, uh huh
I can't crack, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
The day is breaking, we're still here
Your body's shaking and it's clear
You really need it, so let go
And let me beat it, but you know
That I've been down
Across the road or two
But now I've found
The velvet sun that shines on me and you
In the back, uh huh
I can't crack, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
We bring the bump to the grind, uh huh
I don't mind, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
And we don't need to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my bride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine
And we don't need to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my bride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine

Racy days help me through the hopeless haze
But my, oh my
Tragic eyes, I can't even recognize myself
Behind
So, if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
Out again, a siren screams at half past ten
And you won't let go
While I ignore that we both felt like this before
It starts to show
So, if I have a chance
Would you let me know?
Why aren't you shaking?
Step back in time
Graciously taking
Oh, you're too kind
And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
We're all the same
And love is blind
The sun is gone
Before it shines
And I said if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
If the answer is no
Can I change your mind?

I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the backseat on my mind
And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak but no one heard her cry
Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy
I know there's a hope
There's too many people trying to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's something in my head
Somewhere in the backseat
We were just a good thing
We were such a good thing
Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard
Make it go away, oh
Drive faster, boy
The crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars and atmosphere and watched her disappear
Into the midnight show
Faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep
If you can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
I can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep
If you can keep a secret

Doo, doo, doo doo
I believe in you and me
I'm coming to find you
If it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right
And I won't forget you
At least I'll try
And run
And run
Tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
(Alright, alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
La la la la, oh ho
I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I'd thought I'd seen them all
Then you took me by surprise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And, babydoll, I meant it
Every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
But it's alright
(Alright)
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Alright

Glamorous indie rock and roll is what I want
It's in my soul, it's what I need
Indie rock and roll, it's time
Two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine
You can bet your, your bottom dollar on me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock and roll for me
In the clutch I'm talking every word for all the boys
Electric girls with your worn down toys
Making up, breaking up
What do you care?
Oh, what do you care?
I take my twist with a shout
A coffee shop with a cause
Man, I'll freak you out
No sex, no drugs, no luck, no love
When it comes to today
Stay if you wanna love me, stay
Oh, don't be shy
Let's cause a scene
Like lovers do
On silver screens
Let's make it, yeah
We'll cause a scene

She's got her halo and wings
Hidden under his eyes
But she's an angel for sure
She just can't stop telling lies
But it's too late for his love
Already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke
And she is not coming back
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Yeah, she's got a criminal mind
He's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun
He's got to hold everyday
Now he just wants to wake up
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'Cause she's an angel for sure
But that remains to be seen
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
And without her, it's not the same
But it's alright
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
They keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Again and again

We took a walk that night but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go so let me know if it's all right
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I never let her go
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
And then you whisper in my ear
"I know what you're doing here"
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh

Comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm comin' out of my cage
And I've been doin' just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss

Save some face
You know you've only got one
Change your ways
While you're young
Boy
One day you'll be a man
Oh, girl
He'll help you understand
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Looking back
At sunsets on the Eastside
We lost track
Of the time
Dreams
Aren't what they used to be
Some things
Slide by so carelessly
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Oh no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the backseat on my mind
And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak but no one heard her cry
Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy
I know there's a hope
There's too many people trying to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's something in my head
Somewhere in the backseat
We were just a good thing
We were such a good thing
Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard
Make it go away, oh
Drive faster, boy
The crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars and atmosphere and watched her disappear
Into the midnight show
Faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep
If you can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
I can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep
If you can keep a secret

Doo, doo, doo doo
I believe in you and me
I'm coming to find you
If it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right
And I won't forget you
At least I'll try
And run
And run
Tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
(Alright, alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
La la la la, oh ho
I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I'd thought I'd seen them all
Then you took me by surprise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And, babydoll, I meant it
Every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
But it's alright
(Alright)
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Alright

I'm not a rat to be spat upon
Locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play
In the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings
Take me high above
And I looked high
Saw the empty sky
If I could only
Could only fly
I'd drift with them
In endless space
But no man flies
From this place
At night I lay upon my bench
And stare towards the stars
The cold night air come creeping in
And home seems oh so far
If I could only swing
Upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens
Upon the ones I love
Hey, the lucky locket
Hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you
And I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own
Just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth
Of every man
Just send up my love
Ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself
In this room for years

The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings
You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor

It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight
Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway
It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door

She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection
And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea
The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand

Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there
Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the woods
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough
Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover

I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room
While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colors
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails
Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich

In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand
Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window
The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer
In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip

Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very, so very far behind

Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hill
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have

The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her
All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains
Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through

Hey there
Look in the mirror
Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
Waiting, waiting at windows
Oh it's me that you need
Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you
But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need
Watching, watching the swallows fly
It all means the same
Just like them
You can fly home again
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
Pride is an ugly word girl
And you still know my name

I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights.
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love. Your love protects my fears.
And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind,
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind.
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.
Did you paint your smile on when I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling, but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle, with the grace of a dove.
And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind,
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind.
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.

If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Well I know he's not old 
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
What I'm told is never, never for certain
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul, yeah, yeah
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me, take me, oh, oh
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah
Take me, take me, baby, baby, baby
Take me, take me

Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean
So ride in line shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise
Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow
So ride in line shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoestrings on Louise, come on, gal
All those city women who want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
Yeah, I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them
Yeah, so ride in line shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, oh, yeah
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, yeah, oh...

I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely
No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where 'ere you are
I am who I am
You are who you are
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman

Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the specter he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there what's his color I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace

Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
The strange new sound that make boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded. Must be displayed.
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That makes strange sounds. Strange sounds that sing.
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother.
This is your brand new brother.
This is your brand new brother, la la la la la la...

Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Well I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then break all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy

No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once more
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows have to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die
Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
Should I cry sanctuary?
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows have to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die
Yeah, the king must die
The king must die, oh yeah
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once more
The king is dead, the king is dead
The king is dead, the king is dead
Long live the King

It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon

Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain and never say good day to the new dawn
On the big screen they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one
And tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me grey seal
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
And tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me grey seal
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I
And tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me grey seal
Tell me grey seal how does it feel
Tell me grey seal how does it feel
Tell me grey seal how does it feel

If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me
I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned
Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows
Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

Bell door on clanks, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard I hear a zip
Pee pee pressed against my lips
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
I sense others in the room
Opey, Aunt Bea, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I died smothered in Andy's clutch
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed

I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night, free
I do
I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number two
I do keep a date with you
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night, free
I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No I can't see you every night
Free
I do
I do

Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Would you believe me when I do you
You are the queen of my heart?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?

At my feeding time
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again, a good hosing down
The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Can not look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twitch and masturbate
Ah
I said so
I said so
I said so

Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me, why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones, they point in my way
They come with a flash of light and take my family away
And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends or ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you
To take
Me with
You're right

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood, and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keep the cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart
They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood, and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keep the cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to his heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart
They lead a lifetime that is comfortable

He loves her more than he will ever show
Keep the cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart

Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your might and wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Easy in an easychair?
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box
I'm new
Now you
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your might and wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud

(Music &amp; Lyrics: Kurt Cobain)
Portray sincerity, act out of loyalty
Defend every country, wish away pain
Hand out lobotomies to save little families
Surrealistic fantasy bland, boring, plain.
Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion.
Is the whole thing shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty masturbating.
Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words as you go along
I sink then some.
Slippery pessimist, hypocrite master
Conservative Communist, apocalyptic bastard
Thank you, dear God, for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst.
Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion.
Is the whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty masturbating.
Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough of the words as you go along
I sing then some.

If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
You could do anything

Would you believe me when I do you
You are the queen of my heart?

She should have stayed away from friends

This song is for lovers out there
And the little light in the trees
And all the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily 
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you'll only break my heart...
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, beat it, masturbate it
I been looking for day glo
Always hearing the same ol'
Say you want to be faithful
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, how low, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yay!
Hey
Yay
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, hello

Polly wants a cracker

Think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours, I like you
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours, I like you
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins, I like you

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without any rules
And we'll share what's left of what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still
Smell her on you
Smell her on you

I need a lady, not somebody shady
Need someone to be close to
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosy
Help me see my whole day through
Someone to share the load
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live
Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me
Send me down someone for me
Said I won't be choosy, you could send me a floozy
Send me anybody, you please
Somebody say you will
Somebody further still
Somebody, some somebody for me
Now won't you send me somebody?
Yeah, somebody
Won't you send me somebody?
Now won't you send me somebody?
Well, call for somebody, scream loud and bloody
Call woman, woman, come on to me
Save for tomorrow, share all your sorrow
Misery enjoys company, yes it does, yes it does
Somebody say you will
Somebody further still
Somebody, some somebody for me
Somebody say you will
Somebody further still
Somebody, some somebody for me

Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines in my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things
Come back to you
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me
If it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Well, sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me
If it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me
If it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Blues hearted lady, sleepy was she
Love for the devil, brought her to me
Seas of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holdin' me in
Ooh, woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Ooh, woe is me, I feel so sadly for you
In time, bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail
Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken far, far away
Heat of my candle, show me the way
Seas of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holdin' me in
Ooh, woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Ooh, woe is me, I feel so sadly for you
In time, bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

When I'm in heat and someone gets a notion
I jump to my feet, I hoof it to the ocean
Yeah, we hit a beach where no one gives a hoot
Nobody never, ever wears a suit
The ladies there, they look so proud
That's 'cause they know that they're so well endowed
Now, I ain't much for Fannie's conversation

Chaaaa
Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
Baby with a lonely kinda life to lead
Her mammy was lusted, daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted 'til the orphan bleeds
But when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers, was the life to lead
But when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane, ow
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooooh, oh yeah
Ooooh, oh yeah-ha-ha
Now she's doin' any for money and a penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three
Her's is the cunnin' for men who come a-runnin'
They all come for fun and it seems to me
That when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window

Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window

Back when Cain was able, way before the stable
Lightnin' struck right down from the sky
A mother ship with fate said, "Let's give it a try"
Conscience was related, man he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
A sweet and bitter fruit, it surely opened his eyes
Well she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin' wrong from right, right, right, right
Even Eve in Eden
Voices tried deceivin'
With lies that showed the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned and tried to walk away
Man he was believer, lady was deceiver
So the story goes, but you see
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree
So she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin' wrong from right, right, right
Conscience was related, man he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
The sweet and bitter fruit, is sure to open his eyes
Evil came like rainin', who knows who's complainin'
Somethin' tried to lay her to waste
And all she want and need was just a little taste
Whoa, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin' wrong from right, right, right
Well she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah she ate it
Never knowin' wrong from right, right 
Oh, that's right

Backstroke lover, always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said "You ain't seen nothin'
Til' you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your way"
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Then I knowed love was here to stay
When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss!
Like this
Ooh
Uh
School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
A-sing "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss!
Like this...

Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I get out my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
Now now hey
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said, "Now stop that jivin'.
Now whip out your big ten inch."
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just loves my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
My girl don't go for smokin'
And liquor just make her flinch
Seem she'll go for nothin'
Suck on my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Band that play the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
You talk about things and nobody cares
You're wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year
Some sweat-hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go must have got up and went
Well I got good news she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You tell enough things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
A-yes it did
Standing in the front just a-shaking your ass
I take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

Blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand
Ain't seen the daylight since we started this band
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
Store bought clothes fallin' 'part at the seams
Tea leaf readin' gypsies fortune tellin' my dreams
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
Holiday Inn, lock the daughter with a chain
You love 'em and you hate it but to me they're all the same
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
Baby I'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage
Stalemate, jailbait, ladies can't refuse
You love 'em then you leave 'em with your sold-out reviews
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
Sweet talkin' barroom lady's disease
Slippin' with her lips slidin' down your knees
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)
Me 'n my life a screamer
Bound to a wife 'n marriage
Baby I'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces on their lover's code of passion
The men call it pleasure but to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a-changin' nothin' ever stands still
If I don't stop a-changin' I'll be writin' my will
It's the same old story, never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill
Baby I'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage

If you believe in me like I believe in you
You wouldn't be tellin' me things that weren't exactly true
Now everythin' changes, I ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin' baby,  I can't remember my name
'Cause the life I been livin' and the love I been givin'
Would be sure to set you spinnin' witcha' feet never touchin' the ground 
And I'm round and round
Well it was one for all and it was all for one
And everythin' that we did never bothered no one, look here
Now everythin' changes, I ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin' baby,  I can't remember my name
'Cause the life I been livin' and the love someone give me
Would be sure to set me spinnin' with my feet never touchin' the ground
Goin' round and round and round and round and round and round and round
Can you remember the days when you were sweet sixteen
And always caught in the blaze of someone else's dreams, looky Now everythin' changes, I ain't nothin' the same
I'm gettin' the strangest feelin' baby,  I can't remember my name
I'm goin' round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round

You see me cryin', don't let it get'cha down
You see me cryin', I'm back to the lost and found
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
You see me cryin', say you're a ladies man
You see me cryin',  I'm so hard to understand
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
You see me cryin', please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover honey, I'll take you to town
And I'll show you everythin' I know
And I'll never, ever let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry-go-round
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
Honey what'cha done to your head?
Honey was the words I said
Aaahh

I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
Ridin' into town alone by the light of the moon
I'm lookin' for Sukie Jones, she crazy horse saloon
Barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink, that make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Come easy, go easy, all right, 'til the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots, tonight I'm like a loaded gun
Peelin' off my boots and chaps, I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine, I'll come when I get back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful
I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Ridin' high
Ridin' high
Ridin' high
Already

I'm dreaming tonight
I'm living back home
Right!
Take me back to-a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafras-y
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Gotta get back to the real nitty gritty
Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home, sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poontang sweetheart, sweathog
That makes ya a purse
From a J. Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home Sweet Home
Get out in the field put the mule in the stable
Ma, she's a cookin' put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city and my love's in the meadow
Hand's on the plow and my feet's in the ghetto
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when boss man's
Stuffin' down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rockin' the streets
Home Sweet Home
Mama, take me home, sweet home
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street...

Goin' under rats in the cellar
Goin' under skin's turnin' yellow 
Nose is runny losin' my connection 
Losin' money gettin' no affection 
New York City blues 
East side West side blues 
Throw me in the slam 
Catch me if you can 
Believe 
That you're wearin'
Tearin' me apart 
Safe complaining 'cause everything's rotten 
Go insanin' and ain't a thing forgotten 
Feelin' cozy rats in the cellar 
Cheeks are rosy skin's turning yellow 
Loose and soggy lookin' rather lazy 
See my body pushin' up the daisies 
New York City's dues 
East side west side news 
Throw me in the slam 
A catch me if you can 
Believe 
That you're wearin'
Tearin' me apart
New York City blues
East side west side blues
Throw me in the slam
A catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearin'
Tearin' me apart

The street is cold the dawn is gray 
My heart says no but my head says stay 
My work is finished or so I've been told 
You can't part the three of us once we got a hold 
I forgot my name 
I took a shot on the chin 
I'm rearranging my game 
Tell by the shape I'm in 
In the line of fire you know what to say 
They gave us no choices just one shade of gray 
My legs keep moving don't seem to stray 
But I know each step we take they're one step away 
I found the secret the key to the vault 
We walked in darkness kept hittin' the walls 
I took the time to feel for the door 
I found the secret the key to it all 
I got the Nouveauree 
And dragged it home to bed 
I traded you for me 
I took it all and said 
I find my own fun sometimes for free 
I got to pay it to come lookin' for me 
Walking on Gucci wearin' Yves Saint Laurent 
Barely stay on 'cause I'm so God damn gaunt 
I found the secret the key to the vault
We walked in darkness kept hittin' the walls
I took the time to feel for the door
I found the secret the key to it all

Please I just got to talk to you
Please a get'cha your head out of the loo
Please and we're a long long way from home
Please you'd turn a young man's face to stone
Sick as a dog what's your story
Sick as a dog a cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog you're really ain't that young
Please you were much to my surprise
Please you're the lady in disguise
Please you're the only a friend I got
Please you'll be the last to see me rot
Sick as a dog what's your story
Sick as a dog uum... cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog 'cause ya really ain't that young
Please it's a shame you're so refined
Please you was the last thing on my mind
Please don't be late to take it light
Please you're gonna bay into the night
Sick as a dog what's your story
Sick as a dog uum... cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog 'cause you really ain't so young...
Shuuuu...
Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Say goodnight
Take it light

Hey there, looking at me
Tell me, what do you see?
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit gray
Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time
What is it that drives me mad?
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain
That makes me go so insane?
What is it about you that I adore?
Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time
Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh well, it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Maybe we'll meet again someday
Someday

I'll go for miles until I find you
You say you want to leave me but you can't choose
I've gone through pain every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane, something I can't fight
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
A blank expression covering your face
I'm looking for directions to get out of this place
I start to wonder if you'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder, I can't hold back
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me

Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
The pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall, some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I look back on so often
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
Looking back, what I have done, there's lots more left to live
At times I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
Looking back upon my life
Faded memories upon the wall
Looking now at who I am, who am I?
I don't let it get me down
Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
The pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

Now you see me, now you don't, don't ask me where I'm at
'Cause I'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel, don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again
Am I here or am I there?
Or am I playing on the stairs?
Am I in my room with my toys?
I am the disappearing boy
When I walk in crowded rooms, I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I don't belong
In that room I see her, I see her and she's with him
I turn around and then I'm gone
Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I am the disappearing boy
I have my doubts of where I belong
It's something to think about
Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I am the disappearing boy

A small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?

Of moving insects, so surreal

Here we go again, infatuation touches me
Just when I thought that it would end
Oh, but then again, it seems much more than that
But I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking
Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's when I say "what the hey?"
Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand, we run away, far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, far away

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures are dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they've had to change
I liked them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing will ever be the same
The sun is rising now, I ask why
The clouds are falling, here comes the rain
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures are dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
And I feel forgotten, feel like rotting
Do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
Adolescence just can't make sense
It's calling my name, it's calling my name
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
All my life I've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join this family
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing
But I feel forgotten, feel like rotting
Do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
Adolescence just can't make sense
It's calling my name, it's calling my name
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain

Hey, can you hear me? I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head
Angel, dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel, turning away
Just when things seem to have changed
So I can rest my head
Hey, can you hear me? I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head

Princess in a schoolgirl's dream, may I please speak to you?
I'm having troubles with control and it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down, I thought it was the street
And so I looked down at my shoes, they were on the wrong feet
And I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
You're the one I wish I had and now my girlfriend's getting mad
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Today as I was walking down, you bumped into me
You said "excuse me" and walked away as I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky that my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply, no clues about your love
And I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
My girlfriend left me on the phone, I'm pathetically left here alone
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Can we find away
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop
I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
You're the one I wish I had and now my girlfriend's getting mad
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Can we find away
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding, my breath is short and
I hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so never let go
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away
I sit outside and watch the sun rise
Look out as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter, we laugh together
I hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so never let go
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away
I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding, my breath is short and
I hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so never let go
'Cause she's 2,000 light years away

Juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Well, look this direction, I know it's not perfection, it's just me
I want to bring you up again now
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet's crying, well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet's crying, well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks since I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own and I'm feeling so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feeling like my own and I'm never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months since I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feeling like my own and I'm never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise, whoa, paradise

Staring out of my window, watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone, I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently, watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away or my brains will explode
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
See the hills from afar, standing on my beat-up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again as the train comes a-rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
Mother, stay out of my way
Of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way
To Christie Road
Mother, stay out of my way
Of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way
To Christie Road
If there's one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It's home, it's home

I wander down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Or I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows
So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Or I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows

I want to be your dominated love slave
I want to be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Smack me in the forehead with a chain
'Cause I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive those staples deep
I want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a belt sander against my skin
Want to feel pain all over my body
Can't wait to be punished for my sins
I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive those staples deep
I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive... staples?

When I was younger I thought that the world circled around me
But in time, I realized I was so wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality
Do you think you're indestructible
And no one can touch you?
Well, I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I want to do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies
Why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you're been there once, hell, I hardly think so
Do you think you're indestructible
And no one can touch you?
Well, I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies
I used to pray at night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother set it down - why?

My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love?
Not as long as there are girls like you
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I want to hurt myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
(But you turn your head) And I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
(So I lose my head) Or I bang it up against the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
Or lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
'Cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
(But you turn your head) And I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
(So I lose my head) Or I bang it up against the wall
I do not mind if this goes on
'Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit that I enjoy myself
80, please keep taking me away, away
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
(But you turn your head) And I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
(So I lose my head) Or I bang it up against the wall

Hey, old man in woman's shoes
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young, did he have dreams of
Wearing women's shoes and being crazy?
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old, will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away
When the old man was in school
Did the golden rules make him go crazy?
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope? It's crazy
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old, will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away
And it seems so frightening, time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around, waste away
And it seems so frightening, time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around, waste away

Why should my fun have to end?
For me it's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to their end
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever?
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
Does it seem like all your memories fade?
You soak up knowledge to fill the space
And still my answer remains
I don't know

A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you
It's news that I forethought
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
I think I just forgot
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
I shuffle through my mind to see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
Oh well, never mind
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds
The love I bitched about, I finally found
But now it's gone
And I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me, I am blind without a cause
And now I realize what I have lost
It was something real
That I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?
Tell me worlds of words I might have said
It's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
But now it's gone
And I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Oh, why?
Why?
Why?

Sweet young girl, so soft and blonde
Does exactly what she's been warned
Intoxication's in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Believing all his pain filled lies
Putting his hands onto her thighs
Her purity has now been ripped
He takes it away and then he says
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
Johnny Ray's running scared
As the end is drawing near
Running from the light of day
?Or maybe lie and celebrate?
The slightest urge goes from his hands
Follow me if you understand
He's got the trigger on his gun
Final sin and now he runs
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win

Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
'Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Hearing colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
I'm seeing faces of mysteries of the earth
I am not one with the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance or hallucinations I can't find
A missing piece of the thought that's in my mind
Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
'Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Hearing colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

Looking out through clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of grace
Now I wonder where this place is from
The average person is everywhere
I got a job and now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found
Evidence is everywhere
I start to run, now I'm scared
Strange beings all around.
Everyone come to this place I've found
I feel what it's like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries
My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you want to be for sure
I know my rights, I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head that you will find
Mother love from all mankind
You look above and then you shout
No other way to say your head is right
I feel what it's like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries
I feel what it's like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries

I think I can do Who...
Well, people try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
The things they do look awful cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation
Why don't you all just fade away? (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
(Heineken? Fuck that shit!)
Why don't you all just fade away? (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Apathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don't mind
I've lived in this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them anyway
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you and all the shit you put me through
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

I don't know you, but I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face
Well, maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
You're the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me
Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
I'm a chump

I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for the motivation
Smokin' my inspiration
Huah!
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's callin'
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fuckin' lonely
Suh!
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I was slippin' away to paradise
A-some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth

The mist is slowly lifting
The sound of life misplaced your mind
You're sitting, spellbound throughout time
I hope that you remember what you find
Singin' for the lifetime, yea
You put it down, all that I'm thinking
But take a long and distant search
When all is right you take for granted
You can't look down but you're no worse, no no no no, my my my
My my my my my my my my my
Singin' for the lifetime, yea yea yea yea yea yeah
The countless visions that are drifting
The silver dreams, you hate to lose
There's no harm, we've all been waiting
Well keep your faith, do what you choose
Singin' for the lifetime, yea

Everybody's got the blues
In the morning day, yeah
If you find the answer
And you wonder let's find a way
I want to give you happiness
Just like the sun gives to the day
I'd like to make you mine, yeah
I'm gonna make you mine
Just like a blinding dream
Yeah, you're gonna be with me, yeah
Strolling through a summer's breeze
And you find it's not the rain
Leaving wrong behind you
All your fantasies so very plain
I want to give you happiness
Just like the sun gives to the day
I'd like to make you mine, yeah
I'm gonna make you mine
Just like a blinding dream
Yeah, you're gonna be with me, yeah

Say everybody and everyone
We've been waitin', so very long
To play some music and have some fun
Bring some happiness to everyone
Well come with us and try and learn what's on your mind
Open your ears and eyes and let's see what you can find
You're not so different, I don't mean to be unkind
Something's unfolding if you really take the time, Lord
So let the sun shine it's just begun
You've given all you could to anyone
Well don't you lose it, don't run away
It's getting stronger, day after day
You're sittin' there, you say you're waiting for the show
And what you have, and what you hear is what you really want to know
You've only come here 'cause there's nowhere else to go
We're only sorry, that we have to end the show.
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Yeah

In my lonely feeling
From my darkest dreams,
I go on through days as I wonder,
Always changing, forever dreaming
Am I the master of my soul?
Now my reason's changing.
Fear has faded away.
No more days of my wonder,
Can't stop feeling,
No disbelieving,
Yes, I'm the master of my soul.

Mountain of mystery
Rising high above the clouds.
Mountain of magic
Standin' tall and proud
Your magical veins flowing silver and gold
Your cumulus cloud glows misty red
As Apollo sets beyond your head
Releasing the pressure built over the years
The mountain is crying hot lava tears
Molten rock created under 
Vibrations of subterranean thunder
Ejecting boulders like pieces of sand
The mountain is giving birth to the land
Birth to the land
Under your feet, you feel a rumble
As thousands of rocks
Are starting to tumble
Above the trees where the buzzard flies
Swirling vapors begin to rise
Beneath those misty peaks you hide
A tremendous force boiling deep inside

Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright
Yes she did, well come to bed and turn out the light
She's sleeping there, she's dreaming through her life
Yes, she is
Well you know you've done no wrong
All you done is sing this song
You sing this song, yeah
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Everything is alright (wooh!)
That's when the bad man meets his fate
Sitting there, you're feeling only second rate
You're sorry now, you've come a little bit too late
Yes, you did
But when you come around
You only bring you down
You feel a clown, yeah
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Everything is alright, yeah, yeah
Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright
You know she said, you've got to see the coming light
You know you are, you're riding through your life
Yes, you are
Well, you know you've done your best
All you need's a little rest
You've done your best, yes
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Everything is alright

Everything is alright
Everything is alright

Guess I'm coming home
Yeah you know I'm coming home someday
You know I'm coming home

The futures brighter now it's not so far away
It's right around the corner
Just around the corner, oh no
Just around the corner, oh no no no ho
Just around the corner, oh no no
Just around the corner, yeah

All alone through the countryside
Clouds in my brain, vision in my eyes
Thoughts are on the wall
Like oceons on the sand
Midnight dreamer, take me if you can
You can't deny, it seems so easy to do
But women trade in black
And now she's sinning on you
Giving you my heart, there's nothin' you can do
Midnight lover, I'm in love with you
She's my midnight lover, wild and fancy free
Standing in the shadows in the palace of my dreams
You're a pretty thing, like fire from the sun
You've got to catch her while she's shining before the morning comes
Ah, ah, ah
Could this be a dream?
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Ah, ah, ah

Pretty lady make me crazy
Come stay with me a while
Want to know where time begins, yeah
Your life is shown through your smile
Take it easy, pretty lady
My meaning's very clear
The summer's gone
And it's gettin' cold, babe
When you call my name I won't be here
You know, I'm gonna leave you babe
And you know that I'm gonna leave
Yes I am
From a corner light
You call from the dark of night
Sounds so easy for you to please me, babe
And it sounds so right
Another night, another night to spend together
You're makin' love all the while
Oh, it's really, really not make believe
When you touch that desert sky
You know I'm gonna leave you babe
And you know I'm gonna leave, leave, leave, leave
And you know I'm gonna leave
You know, yeah, babe, I'm gone
All righty drop down!
Now you're struttin' before the sun
Can't you feel the flame?
You've been wastin', wastin' precious time
It'll never be the same
Now your head, now your head is pounding
The night is cold and blowing rain
The search is what a shadow you been missin'
One you'll never see again
You know I'm gonna leave you babe
And you know that I'm gonna leave
And you know that I'm gonna leave
You know, yeah, babe you know

Don't be so wise, I was born to fly
Not without a place in the wind
Walked off a cliff, then I closed my eyes
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman
Don't need no feathers, I don't need no twine,
I'm all together in my body and my mind,
Not supernatural, just a human combine,
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman!
Can't see a castle, I don't need a sleigh,
I brought my wings, no, not today
I'm a cosmopolitan, right-handed wingless man
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman.

Who are the ones that slip and slide through life,
Moving like the waves in a sink,
People, always need a minute or two to think.
Who says they're not going to Hell,
Climbing the stairway to you know where,
People, Oh! so happy until they scare.
Who always has got to talk about somebody else,
Born as a God, they think that's got to be
People, simply just another you and me.

Many days have faded away and the time has passed,
Those were memories that have been by so fast,
I can't see you
I can't hear you
But I feel you
I would find you,
I would find you,
Well, I would find you,
I would find you
(Repeat)
Now that we know that we've been there and the time is running out,
That message was from the Lord without a doubt,
I can't see you
I can't hear you
But I feel you
Could it be that I feel so all alone
It's you that's driving me mad
You won't leave me alone
You have touched my soul
You have touched my soul
Now hear me-
Could it be that you feel so all alone?
If it's me that's driving you mad,
Oh, I would leave you alone
Oh yes I would.

When you give your all
And you're feeling small, don't you cry
If you're crying loud,
You won't feel so proud, don't you cry.
There's a place to be
Won't you stay with me
You can't help, but see
Here we are.
Let yourself go by,
You can touch the sky
If you try.
All you've got to show
You may never know, what you are.
If you ever try,
Can you tell me why, why you are.
Only you will know
And you picked your show.
Can you tell me though,
Will you know?
If you feel like me
You can't help but please
Who you know.
If you're feelin' low,
Will you tell me though, who you are.
Only you will know
And you picked your show
Can you tell me though,
Will you know?
If you feel like me
You can't help but please
Who you know.

I get beside women all men desire,
Crazy with passion I'll never be tired,
Money's no good to me 'cause lovin's my game,
I don't need no trouble and I'll show you no pain.
I move like a lover, so silent and swift,
Screamin' women love me, just can't resist
I can't be bought, your payoff's no good,
So lock up your women, like you know you should.

Sitting in the corner of a room, thinkin' of you.
Wonderin' what you're doing now we're apart.
No use cryin', tears can't reach you now.
Memories, fulfilling dreams.
You used to be, so good to me,
I can't live without you.
I'd like to be, in your fantasy baby,
Part of you is me, wo-
Walking across the clouds, hope I see you there.
Be it day or nighttime, I don't really care.
Hope you see me too, before I meet my end.
Someone stole my life away, I can't pretend.

Oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild.
Oh baby, you look to me as if you're still a child.
Your innocence to me is so hard to believe,
Just a spell in my past, tell me, how long will you last.
Oh baby, you stole my lonely heart for you.
Oh baby, I wanna tell you what you can do.
I no longer care about the things we shared, you always had your way.
Won't you find a place today, won't you find a place to stay (repeat).

When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So you think you're lonely?
Well, my friend, I'm lonely, too
I want to get back to my city by the bay
(Oh, oh, oh)
It's sad, oh
There's been mornings out on the road without you
Without your charms
Oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
(Oh, oh, oh)
When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh

Opened my eyes to a new kind of way
All the good times that you saved
Are you feeling,
You feeling that way too
Or am I just,
Am I just a fool
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too?
Or am I just
Am I just a fool
A new road's waiting, you touched my life, whoa
Soft and warm on a summer's night
You're the only one, I told you, the only one I love
The lovely one, I'm thinking of
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too?
Whoa, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you feeling that way too?

Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me

Hoping and praying for you
Listen to me and enlighten me
I hope that you need me too, 'cause,
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you need me
Give me all of your sunshine
A spark is all I need
To take away, all of the shadows
Well what more can I say.
Anytime at all
Anytime at all

Something about you baby
Really knocks me off my feet
Something about you sweetheart
Brings this poor boy to his knees
La, do, da, do, day
La, do, da, do, day
Something about you baby
When you touch me sweet so fine
I feel it, I feel it
When your body's close to mine
La, do, da, do, day
La, do, da, do, day

Here I stand so patiently
For your lights to shine on me
For your song inside of me
This we bring to you
In the shadow of love
Time goes by leaving me helpless
Just to reach and try
To live my life
These are my reasons, so
Here we stand so patiently
For your song inside of me
For your lights to shine on me
This we bring to you
One, One, in a million

Winter is here again, oh Lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh, I've been runnin' down this dusty road
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it before too long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm standing in a sleet of rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The mornin' sun is risin'
It's kissin' the day
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Woahohohoh, ohohoh... My, my, my, my, my...

By the last breath, the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children, now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah
Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do
So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away
Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance
Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Down in the depths of my fiery home, the summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one you people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out and they always shall obey
Follow me now my child, not the meek or the mild but do just as I say
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire
Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me, I am you you see, there is part of me in everyone
So reach down, grab my hand, walk with me through the land, come home where you belong
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire
C'mon, jump baby, now

Bass solo, take one

Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad
Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight
Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose
Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Here we go!
Whiplash!
The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica
Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord
The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord
Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

All right
Scannin' the scene in the city tonight
Lookin' for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been takin' but now you're giving
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away till our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy, hahahaha

Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning
Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go
Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, oh the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man, yeah

Let us have peace, let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time, let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign
The day is coming
Armageddon's near
Inferno's coming
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?
The blitzkrieg
The blitzkrieg
Save us from fate, save us from hate
Save ourselves before it's too late
Come to our need, hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds
The day is dawning
The time is near
Aliens calling
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?

By the last breath, the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children, now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah
Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do
So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight

Guilty as charged but damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Life it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way
Life's for my own to live my own way

Slaves, Hebrews born to serve to the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word, live in fear
Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done for hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
I rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door, I shall pass
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Battery
Battery

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Master, master
Master, master
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
In madness you dwell
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man
Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front

One, two
One, two, three, four, five
Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Witchery, weakening
See the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated
Go
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

La la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum

Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 
Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la, la la 
La la la, la la 
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down
So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream
I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Am I?
Don't set me free
I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me
(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar
Dark and grim
They must be very dim)
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel
Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free
I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

In the days of my youth
I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part
I feel good when I look into your eyes.

Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said, baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'm leave you when the summertime

Leave you when the summer comes along

Oh, I can hear it callin' me back ho-wome
Baby, oh, babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know I've really got to leave you
Oh, I can hear it callin' me

We're gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away
Oh, alright
So good sweet baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away, oh, oh, oh
Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's callin' me
I said, that's when it's callin' me back home

You know you shook me, you shook me all night long
You know you shook me baby, you shook me all night long

Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lotsa people talkin', few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah
You hurt and abuse, tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again
Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're goin', only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

Messin' around, every guy in town
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new
Always the same, playin' your game
Drive me insane, trouble's gonna come to you
One of these days, and it won't be long
You'll look for me, but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to ya, woman
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Made up my mind, break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say, 'cause I'm goin' away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talkin' all around
Watch out, woman, no longer is the joke gonna be on my heart

And if I say to you tomorrow
"Take my hand, child, come with me"
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoa!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine by takin' our time
Ooh, ho-whoa
And if you say to me tomorrow
"Oh, what fun it all would be"
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby-ay
But what is and what should never be
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoa!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
Only goes to show that you will be mine a-by takin' our time
Ooh, oh, oh
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Well, girl, the answer lies (with) you, yeah
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoa!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show-ow that you will be mine by takin' our time
Ooh
Hey, ho, ma
A-well, the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show-whoa-whoa-whoa
Catch the wind, we're gonna see us spin
We're gonna sail, leave today-a
A-do-do-do, ba-ba-n-do, oh
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, yeah

People worry, baby, can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell ya, babe

Down on this killin' floor
Squeeze me, babe, till the juice runs down my leg
Do, please, squeeze me baby, until the juice runs down my leg

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
Oh my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look, see
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you, it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Hey fellas, have you heard the news
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace from the Lord above
People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love, but it ain't no use
You give it to me
You give it
Mm, work so hard, I can't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, you heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart

With a purple umbrella and a fifty-cent hat
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Missus Cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, baby, on the roundabout, ride on the merry-go-'round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Alimony, alimony, payin' your bills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, ya knock it back with pills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, baby, on the roundabout, ride on the merry-go-'round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman/Aw, hit it, now hit it

The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it, pain
And it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams
Got no time for spreading roots, the time has come to be gone
And though our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
I tell you no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
And ain't nothing I can do, no
I guess I'll keep on rambling, I'm gonna shake
Sing my song, I've gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song, gonna work my way, going 'round the world, baby, baby
Ramble on, yeah
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my babe, I really got to part
I gotta keep searching for my baby
I gotta keep-a searching for my baby
I can't find my bluebird

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming
On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

Bright light, almost blindin'
Black night still there shinin'
I can't stop, keep on climbin'
Lookin' for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
"You got a love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only
Lookin' for what I knew
Mm, I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just-a
Met a man on the roadside cryin'
Without a friend, there's no denyin'
You're incomplete, there'll be no findin'
Lookin' for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs ya
Don't let 'em down, although it grieves ya
Someday you'll need someone like they do
Lookin' for what you knew
Mm, mm, I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue, now
It's very easy, just-a, oh, yeah
Ah, nah, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, yeah
I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue, now
It's very easy, it's very easy
It's very easy, it's easy, easy, yeah, yeah, yeah

Her face is cracked from smiling,
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems that pretty soon
Everybody's gonna know.
And her voice is sore from shouting,
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go.
My my my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land.
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door.
Her name is Brown or White or Black,
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell.
My my my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land.
There is a train that leaves the station,
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has!
And if you walk, you're gonna get there,
Although it takes a little longer
When you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan.
Oh, yeah, oh, moan
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, moan.
Come on, get down, get down, get down, yeah
Get down
Ma ma ma ma ma ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, you are gone
You are gone, you're gone, yeah.
And if you walk, you're gonna get there,
Tho' it takes a little longer
And when you see 'em in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan...

Oh
Workin' from seven to eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darlin'
How I love you, baby, mama, love, little girl, little girl
But, baby, since I've been lovin' you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, aw, yeah
Everybody tryin' to tell me that you didn't mean me no good
I've been tryin', Lord, let me tell ya
Let me tell ya, I really did the best I could
I've been, I've been workin' from seven a-to eleven every night
I said, it kind of makes a life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, no, no
Since I've been lovin' you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, yeah
Watch out
I said I've been cryin', yeah
Whoa, my tears, they fell like rain
Don'tcha hear them, don'tcha hear them fallin'
Don'tcha hear them, don'tcha hear them fallin'
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door
I said, you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them new-fangled, new-fangled
Back-door man, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been a-workin' from seven, seven, seven
To eleven every night, it kinda made my life a drag
A drag. drag, oh, yeah, it makes a drag
Baby, since I've been lovin' you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
And just one more, just one more
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, since I've been lovin' you
I'm gonna lose my worried mind

As I walk down the highway, all I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about, the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh, so strong
Just a simple guy, and live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown, blows my blues away
There's nothin' more that I can say
But on a day like today, I'll pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you
All I need from you is all your l-love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I'm so glad I'm livin', (stop), gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man
A-one thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the lovin' like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can
Standin' in the noon-day sun tryin' to flag a ride
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be race
The best thing I can do is run
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me, all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Oh, just remember said you'd be my one
All I really said was 'be my one'
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while

Riding a many mile
Friends, did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends,
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole.
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while

Riding a many mile, mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you,
Take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man.
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
And ride for many mile, mile, mile.
Oh, yes, you got a fine sister,
She warmed my blood from cold
She brought my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole,
Pole, pole, pole, yeah, yeah.
Your brother brought me silver
And your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard,
See you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah

Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain.
Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflections from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between.
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these
To think of us again?
And I do.
Tangerine, Tangerine
Living reflections from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between.

I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what Mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people sayin'
You gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And when I'm out, I see you walkin'
Why don't your eyes see me?
And could it be you've found another game to play?
What did Mama say to me?
"That's the way, oh, that's the way it oughta be"
Yeah, yeah
Mama said, "That's the way it oughta stay"
Yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes?
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dyin'
Had they got ya hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry
I don't know what to say about it
When all your ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it oughta stay?
"That's the way, that's the way it oughta be"
Whoa, don'tcha know now
Mama said, Mama said, "That's the way it's gonna stay"
Yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah

Ah, I caught you smilin' at me, that's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had, I sung love songs so glad
Always smilin', never sad, so fine
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singin' a song, you hear me callin' your name
Hear the wind whisper in the trees
Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout you and me
Well, if the sun shines so bright, or our way is dark as night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah, could any love be so strong when so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?
As we walk down the country lanes
I'm singin' a song, hear me callin' your name
Hear the wind whisper in the trees
Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout a-you and me
My, my, law-de-law, come on, now, it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed Merle
Come on, now, well, let me tell ya
What you're missin', messin' around them brick walls
So, of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure
Angels singin' all 'round my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do, spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no 'Old Shep' gonna happen again
We'll still go walkin' down country lanes
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name

Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu, down

Forgive me, baby, won't be late

Yeah, yeah, I gave my babe twenty-dollar bill
Well, if that don't get that woman out, I'm sure my shotgun will
Yeah, I'll go shoot her, now

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

And for her everyone cried,
Everyone cried,

Cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth
I'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths
To see the land, the women chant as they fly up to the sun
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know
Books all say different things, while people flap their yellow wings
Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything
The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead
But now's a bird able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your brother's earth
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know
On the other side, on the other side, the other side,
Do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly?
Have you ever wanted to die, have you ever wanted to die?
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly,
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side,
Never try to die, you ever try to die.
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know

The kombucha mushroom people

Who could believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar!

Some people, some people, some people

You know that every time I try to go
Where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there!
The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who could believe you?
Who could believe you?

Sugar!
The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who could believe you?
Who could believe you?
Let your mother pray!
I sit... in my desolate room...
No lights!

Fuck you, it all goes away

Watching from a post up high
From where you see the ships afar
From a well-trained eye
The waves all keep on crashing by
If you are the light post
Then you own the working class
But if you want the answers
You better give a piece of ass
Give a piece of your ass
Warning, post hypnotic suggestions
Running the ships ashore
The orange light that follows
Will soon proclaim itself a god
If you point your questions
The fog will surely chew you up
But if you want the answers
You better get ready for the fire
Get ready for the fire
The ships are multiplying day after day, sir
And they're coming close to the shore, sir, shore, sir
We need to evacuate the light post
It's all over, it's all over
It's all over
SONG MEANING: Serj Tankian, the lead singer, says this song is about post-hypnotic suggestion being used in the assassination of President Kennedy. Go figure.

The piercing radiant moon (The piercing radiant moon)
The storming of poor June (Storming of poor June)
All the life running through her hair (Through her hair)
Approaching guiding light (Approaching guiding light)
Our shallow years in fright (Our shallow years in fright)
Dreams are made, winding (Dreams are made, winding)
Through my head (Through my head)
Through my head
Before you know, awake
Your lives are open wide
The V-chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair
The spiders all in tune
The evening of the moon
Dreams are made, winding
Through my head
Through my head
Before you know, awake
Through my head
Through my head
Before you know
Before you know I will be waiting, all awake
Dreams are made winding through her hair
Dreams are made winding through her hair

Plagiarized existence exist
Among the writers of the word
Shake your spear at Shakespeare
Shake your spear at Shakespeare
Loud and noisy
Strong refrigerators
Gaining independence
Gaining independence
Stupid people do stupid things
Smart people outsmart each other
Then themselves, then themselves
Then themselves, then themselves
Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
So lovely
So lovely
My blue moon rivets in exits
Forewarned customary spirits
By myself, by myself
By myself, by myself
Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely
Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely
SONG MEANING: This song is about dealing with corrupt companies.

The phoenix, he helped create
Out of control, boy without a dad
Shot the gun that startled my life
While I drove him with a forty-five
Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, dreams, insecurity
Men fall unrealized
Unrealized, unrealized
Making a decision of death
While everyone around you plead
Now you fly in peace
I hope, my friend
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do
When he's meant to do it
Even if he doesn't really want to
My memories are of fun and friendship
Of weakness within the strength of youth
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, dreams, insecurity
Your men fall unrealized
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in the skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Why the fuck did you take him away from us?
You motherfucker!

Dark is the light
The man you fight
With all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold, this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the Holy Land was taken
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness
That lead the noble to the East
To fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!
Now international security
The call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill man
History teaches us so
The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Oh, baby come close to me.
Let me, love, you.
Oh, baby come close to me.
Let me, feel, you.
Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other,
Look at each other, look at each other, ...
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Well now, mutually, mentally molested children of a mother
Mutually, mentally molested children of sin
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that took you under
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that broke your skin
Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame hate for fate's seed
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Well, you need the ones you love and love the ones that you need
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see
Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame hate for fate's seed
Die, die, die, die
Gonna let you motherfuckers die, gonna let you motherfuckers die
Gonna let you motherfuckers die, gonna let you motherfuckers die!
Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other

When your stars are baked
And your rivers fly
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky
When your castle breaks
And your feet are dry
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky
Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high
When your moon is fake
And your mermaids cry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
When your tunnel fades
And your guide is shy
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky
Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high

Preflight delight
Defaced street lights
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now
Popcorn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Corn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Rare (repeat)
I want to be
A fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare

Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti

Long not for the one who've lost their way

Could you tell me?

I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains and the walking of the canes
When you do come out
And you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy
But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?
And you, a parasite
Just find another host, just another fool to roast
'Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
I cannot deny
All the evil traits and the filling of the crates
When you do come out
And you slither up to me in your pimping majesty
But I cannot grow
Till you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?
And you, a parasite
Just find another host just another stool to post
'Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of me
I'm sitting in my room with a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man

Circumventing circuses
Lamenting in protest
To visible police
Presence sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police
With rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy
Service with a smile
Beyond the Staples Center, you can see America
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
A rush of words
Pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call
The fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train
Beyond the Staples Center, you can see America
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Push them around
A deer dance, invitation to peace
War staring you in the face
(Dressed in black)
With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents
The little boy smiled, it'll all be well
And say the little boy smiled, it'll all be well
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
They like to push the weak around

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
My horse
Is a shackled old man
His, his remorse
Was that he couldn't survey
The skies right before
Right before they went gray
My horse and my remorse
Flying over a great bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
My source
Is the source of all creation
Her discourse
Is that we all don't survey
The skies right before
Right before they go gray
My source and my remorse
Flying over a great bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

We're rolling "Suicide"
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup (hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable
You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup

Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?

I don't think you trust

I cry when angels deserve to die

Walk with me, my little child
To the forest of denial
Speak with me, my only mind
Walk with me until the time
And make the forest turn to wine
You take the legend for a fall
You saw the product
Why can't you see that you are my child?
Why don't you know that you are my mind?
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you
Walk with me, my little friend
Take this promise to the end
Speak with me, my only mind
Walk with me until the end
And make the forest turn to sand
You take the legend for a fall
You saw the product
Why can't you see that you are my child?
Why don't you know that you are my mind?
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you
Take this promise for a ride
You saw the forest, now come inside
You took the legend for its fall
You saw the product of it all
No televisions in the air
No circumcisions on the chair
You made the weapons for us all
Just look at us now
Why can't you see that you are my child?
Why don't you know that you are my mind?
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always want to go but you never wanna stay
We are the ones that wanna choose
Always want to play but you never wanna lose
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always want to go but you never wanna stay
We are the ones that wanna choose
Always want to play but you never wanna lose, oh
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

Well I have a home, longing to roam
I have to find you, I have to meet you
Signs of your face, slowing your pace
I need your guidance, I need to seek my
Innervision, innervision
My pupils dance, lost in a trance
Your sacred silence, losing all violence
Stars in their place, mirror your face
I need to find you, I need to seek my
Innervision, innervision, innervision

One, two, three, four!
Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Whoa, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

The world is treating me bad
Misery
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad
Misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag
Misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one?
Only one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one
Lonely one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
In misery
My misery

Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him
Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now

I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery
Ask me why
I'll say I love you

Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe
That she would leave me on my own
It's just not right
When every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home, until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all

We're gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hit it again today
You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blown a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps a-singing the blues
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm revues
Roll over, Beethoven
Rockin' in two by two
Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further and a-reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over, Beethoven
A-rockin' in two by two
Well, early in the mornin'
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle, diddle
I'm a-playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she winks like a glow worm
Dives like a spinnin' top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see him reel an' rock
'S long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Well, roll over, Beethoven
Yeah, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Oh, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

That's what I want (that's what I want), yeah
That's what I want

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I'll feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow!
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know, I feel all right
You know, I feel all right

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

Either you got the gown, or many in your posse
Excuse me but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
Either you got the gown, and yes I'd like to watch her
Oh won't you please give me a break,
Oh won't you please leave me alone?
My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high, your food
I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's ...
I'm going to Lenny's ... Or is it Denny's?
You got a problem with me?
I got it turning in my body

Just because I don't like Yetzi doesn't mean that I'm a dopehead
Maybe I'm ducking for cover, but I am real sucka
Maybe if you let me die, you are not exactly right
But if you were left to me, you would be so fucking scared
You wouldn't be so stinking stiff there lady ...
If ya just let me sit down ... and have a Coke ... or something ...
My yamo wants the gabo and I'm a bore
Your glasses are so freakin high,
Your food I can afford to buy, I'm going to Lenny's ...

I will forgive but I won? t forget
And I hope you know you've lost my respect!
Y? better watch out!
If you don? t know what? s going on around you
Y? better think twice
Before you fly off the handle and lose it!
Y? better join us
Before you get lost in the shuffle
You gotta rise against
The demons that are gonna try and hold you down
Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love?
The ones you love
The ones you love
The ones you love
'Cause I? m not a pawn
For you to play in your fucking game!

And I dream that I want to achieve
Under pressure you crumbled and you let me down
I? m not deaf
And all I hear are your empty promises
Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love?

To betray the ones you love!

Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
He's trying to say that he's trapped,
He's got gold chains and hairy chest
He's making me sick in his Saturday night best
Shut your mouth, play on bounced
Money could be a...
Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
What is your sign sweetcakes? Have I seen
You somewhere before?
Can I check your tags?
I swear you were made in Heaven!
Disco fever, trampy hoes
El Comino and a confidential
Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin
The butterfly colour,
In the city gone pumpin, pumpin, pumpin, pumpin ...
Put on your fatty gold chain,
You're pimpin' and struttin' your stuff
Your walking down the aisle, acting like you're above
Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'
The butterfly colour
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... STOP!
Butterfly colour, in the city gone pumpin'

Then he saw the most beautiful creature he'd ever seen
That wide brimmed hat, that fake pink fur coat,
And those fishnet stockings
She was just like him, she was just like him,
She was just like him
A pimp!

Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies
And 1,2,3,4 popping to the doctor
Killing some babies, killing some mommas
To abort
Many babies, I love babies, fooling with a baby, just two, baby
To abort ... your baby
Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies
5,6,7,8 stay home and masturbate
Gotta like your dick, gotta like your dick, gotta like your dick
To abort
Call me a little Jew, me and you, a cup or two
Come a little closer and I'll wrench your neck
Your baby's neck
Abort, abort, abort, abort
No more babies
You can't treat a human like a test-tube monkey so
You can choke, take control from a strung out junkie
To abort
You can't treat a human like a test-tube monkey so

To abort your baby
Abort, abort, abort, abort

Yeah! In the Wood-be, Man!
Yeaauuuh...
Haha!

I've got issues, so does everyone
That never stopped you from sleeping with this loaded gun
I'm sorry for everything I have done (everything I have done)
And now you're telling me 
That I am the one that won't amount to no good
I'd never die for you, not even if I could
And I am the one that's always misunderstood
I'd never die for you, even if I could
Die for you, you know I never would
Mommy's little monster
Wrapped inside a box
Can't forgive her
She threw away the f'kng key
I'll haunt her
For the rest of her life (for the rest of her life)
You're always telling me 
That I am the one that won't amount to no good
I'd never die for you, not even if I could
And I am the one the one that's always misunderstood
I'd never die for you, even if I could
Die for you, you know I never would
You know that I can never forgive you
You wear it out
You break me down (you break me down)
You're always telling me
That I am the one that won't amount to no good
I'd never die for you, not even if I could
And I am the one the one that's always misunderstood
I'd never die for you, even if I could
Die for you, you know I never would
You know, you know I never would 
You know, you know I never would 
You know, you know I never would 
You know, you know I never would

I fell asleep to the sound
Of the church bells ringing out
In this quiet little town I am dreaming
I woke up to the sound
Of an angel crying out
Gotta leave this little town
Gotta move on
Not coming home
Not coming home
This christmas I am all alone
Not coming home
Not coming home
I am out here on the road
Got a phone call from my son
He said dad your number one
And mommy's going nuts I think she's crazy
Put your mother on the phone
I gotta tell her she's not alone
She's sick of waiting around
Then I tell her these words
Not coming home
Not coming home
This christmas I am all alone
Not coming home
Not coming home
I am out here on the road
Keep holding on
It wont be long
But for now
Not coming home
Not coming home
This christmas I am all alone
Not coming home
Not coming home
I am out here on the road
Keep holding on
It wont be long
But for now
Not coming home

Remember the girl
Abused with forks knives and razorblades? [x2]
She finally left him, had enough of her man's rage
Band-aids cover her scars, she left him blooded
Beat his ass with a bat, face sunk in like Silly Putty
Y'all can sit back so I can study
Destruction of the family design
And how the morals of society decline
Essentially beats to rhymes like grapes to wine
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
You see she can't live with him and can't live without him
Stress got her down, she needs to deal with her problems
As the drama gets deeper, I put on the reefer
Took the last step and sent his ass to the reefer
Chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
Scared of herself and the power that was in her
It took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
Militant insanity is now what controlled her
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
We're in love [x2]
Kill it!
Before it reaches you
Missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
What if it reaches the metropolitan areas, cosmopolitan areas
Secure the lines and prepare for departure, calm, calm, calm
It is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
Cause my style is underground
I'm green with my red eyes mad tint
Flee, fly, flow, rapido rapido
She feeds plentiful
Electrifying the nation [x2]
Don't you see that we are in danger
How will we stop it
She is attacking [x2]
Shocka, danger danger [x4]
Running out we're running out
Running all the time [x4]
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without.

I want to let you in on a story
That I got to tell
About good dreams in heaven not
Bad dreams in hell
Started with punk rock
And then evolved to hip hop
The party popped off
Like the fireworks on my block
Alonzo is the street that I take dweel
A little white trash
And a little bit swell
I take you back
And take a step down
July was the month
I was born 8 pounds
My bad side
My sign is leo defraud the hoax with a ruby
King of the jungle yet I try to be humble
But I should to let y'all know what I'm' about
Attack your brain fast drop knowledge
The I'm out I'm a freak but I got some class
I'll bring the fucking ruckus
And you can bring the grass
Have a session
Good times is the lesson
The men will cease fire and
The girls could stop stressin
Come on baby doll please jerk me off
Perverted state of mind
Baby help me get my nut off
What's wrong girly
Don't know the art of a quicky
My balls hang low
And they produce something icky
From my dick to your skin
Hands rub it in
I know you love lotion baby
That's how I begin
Sexual feeding in my dreams
She was screaming down on her knees
As she eating on my seamen
I've this problem
I don't wanna say
But to tell you the truth everybody
I be doing it every day
You may think I'm stupid
You may think I'm queer
But to tell you the truth everybody
Jackin off is better than beer!
My bad side

As I look at the picture
Of jacoby smoking broccoli
Props to refer
Props to bible prophecies
It's clearly
Evident relationship is permanent
Burn the fucking picutres
So my mind can be the evidence
I've made my choice
There's no looking back
Life long commitment to my second half
Hard times, good times
Two ways to go
I've got my problems
God only knows
It came faster than a blink of an eye
Fire, rain, indapendce, 4th of July
Give in, give into tradition
One thing I'd like to say is
Fuck superstition
My independence day
Is wiped from my face
Maybe I gave it away
Maybe I've got a secret hiding place
I love you
I married you

I could hear myself clear
From the living room
Ruptured pain to fear
Family's dyin' soon
Look in my eye what do you see
Lover y amigo tambien enemy
Because the best thing is life
Is for me to sing these words
All I leave at the shows
Are chrome microphone turds
I take fat hits
And I take fat shits
I cap on the girls
Who give out 10$ thigh splits
Yo all I want is respect
In this game
Cause the papa roach style is wild
And not plain
Know what I'm saying
Put us through your speakers
'Cause I know that we are banging
Positivity and negativity
We saying that you
Can't get the ying
Without the yang
Confidence and style
Mix it up with some slang
And make it grimy
Just like my little nigga stimey
Step up was up
I came to make friends to the end
And back again
And show your stacks again
Because sometimes I'm x-rated
Sometimes I'm g-rated
Sometimes I bugded crowds
Act wild
And get faded
Whether its Monday
Or Tuesday
Or Thursday
Or Friday
I'm getting down
Everyday
Because it's my way
To express the onion hardcore slang
A boogedy bang bang
Boogedy bang bang
Sha bang you know what I'm saying
Put us through your speakers
'Cause I know we are banging
Look in my eyes
What do you see
Lover y amigo
Tambien enemy
The good and the bad
Le bein a le mal
Chaos forever
Natural law

I am a mess
I made a huge mess
I can't control myself!
I kill the rhyme again 
I'm comin' sick and on time again 
Words manifest from deep inside where people hide within'
It's chemical
Unbalanced on the triple beam. What? 
Fuck what ya heard
It's about what I seen 
I seen it happen
Back hand brand to face smackin'
Definite disorder now his mindset is blackened 
The doctors say he got the brain of a murderer 
This rugged style steals your brain
My heart is bleeding
And this pain it will not pass
It's not receding
And my body's going numb
A bad trip child
Rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
He just keeps getting by
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
He's born sick
Nothing in his hands but his dick
He couldn't handle pressure
He couldn't handle shit
For the life he was leading led him down the wrong path 
Where guns blast
Don't give a shit about the gods' wrath 
Don't want to talk to the counselor Doctor 
To tell him what's real
To tell him what's proper
Situation's unclear like gray
And I know it gets worse everyday
My heart is bleeding
And this pain will not pass
It's not receding
And my body's going numb
A bad trip child
Rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
He just keep getting by away
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
I am a mess
I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself!
I'm losing it
I've lost it
I've spilt all my marbles!
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
A hyper spaz and that is me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Don't tell me to do it 'cause I will, no!
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Don't tell me to do it 'cause I will, no!
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
They're screaming
They're screaming
They're screaming

Welcome to the original Papa Roach soundfire
Viva La Cucaracha!
My name's Coby Dick
Mr. Dick if you're nasty
Rock a mic with a voice that's raspy
'Cause I'm poetic in my operations
My God given talent is to rock all nations
We're going to Infest.
Infest, the theory of my first manifesto
Push your wig back with my lyrical pistol
Blow now Papa Roach is on your mental
Banging like your head piece it's just that simple
Cut back and unleash with my physical
Wrap you in my thoughts and become indivisible
Centrifugal, forces individuals into my mind as we rock into ritual
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government the media or your family [x2]
You better do just what I say
Now that I got your attention
Did I forget to mention
All the heads we be infesting
Hope y'all people learn your lessons
Cause the game of life is crazy
Got all the people guessin'
What is wrong with the world today
Government, media, or your family
Would you cry if I died today?
I think it be better if you did not say.
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government the media or your family [x2]
We will infest
Die like the rest
First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Then they grab you by your mind
First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Infest your mind
We will infest
Die like the rest
People are the problem today. [x2]
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government the media or your family. [x2]

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
This is my last resort
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right?
If I took my life tonight; chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
I never realized I was spread too thin
Till it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love from another
Searching to find a lover on a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I can't go on living this way
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right?
If I took my life tonight; chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm cryin'
I can't go on living this way
Can't go on living this way
Nothing's alright

Broken home
All alone
Broken home
All alone
I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
And my wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to
Someone I could confide in
I just want to know the truth
I just want to know the truth
Want to know the truth
Broken home
All alone
I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care?
If I'm sad or angry
You were never ever there
When I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth
Your father did the same to you
Did the same to you
I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me?
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
Crying day and night now
What is wrong with me?
I cannot fight now
I feel like a weak link
(Push it back inside)
(Push it back inside)
A weak link
(Push it back inside)
(Push it back inside)
Broken home
All alone
It feels bad to be alone
Crying by yourself, living in a broken home
How could I tell it so all you could feel it
Depression strikes hard just like my old earth would tell it
To me, her son, she told me I'm the one
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are nonfiction
And you can't take it back 'cause it's already done
Broken home
Broken home
Can't seem to fight these feelings
Caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
Stuck in between my parents
Broken home
Broken home

Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb
What is your target? What is your reason?
Do you have emotions? Is your heart freezing?
Seizin', this opportunity to speak
You didn't say nothin' but turn your fuckin' cheek
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Sick in the head, living but dead
Hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, nutty warrior, nothin's scarier
Kids are gettin' sick like malaria
Situation gets hairier
I'm throwing up all types of barriers
I'm tellin' you
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the Dead Cell shout
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
Stop pointing fingers 'cause we all are guilty
Of clean cut lies and the truth that's filthy
Believe what is the root of the word
Out comes lie when it's cut into thirds
I don't believe what my eyes behold, No!
I don't believe what my ears are told, No!
Seizin, this opportunity to speak
I'm saying something don't turn your fuckin' cheek!
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and then turn 'em on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and then turn 'em on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
Dead... Cell...
Dead... CELL!
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!

There's no money, there's no possessions
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession
I just wanna be heard, loud and clear are my words
Comin' from within', man, tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution, in your heart and in your mind
You can't find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin' but a lifelong lesson
And you're pocket book stressin'
You're a slave to the system, workin' jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinkin' 'bout yourself, start thinkin' 'bout
There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that
'Cause everything is nothing and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
Take your money, burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion
There's no money, there's no possession
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession
Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair and clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
And the things you own, own you now
Take my money, take my possession
Take my obsession, I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possession
Fuck your obsession, I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession
I don't need that shit

Watch your back because the next man is comin'
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
I got your back, you got my back and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins, I got the power
Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickenin' thought is running through my head 
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill! Kill! Kill!
It was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Close to buck 50 and we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of our insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end
Deeper than thoughts that you think not a trend
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill! Kill! Kill!
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill! Kill! Kill!
Again and again
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill! Kill! Kill!
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill

Remember the girl
Abused with forks knives and razorblades? [x2]
She finally left him, had enough of her man's rage
Band-aids cover her scars, she left him blooded
Beat his ass with a bat, face sunk in like Silly Putty
Y'all can sit back so I can study
Destruction of the family design
And how the morals of society decline
Essentially beats to rhymes like grapes to wine
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
You see she can't live with him and can't live without him
Stress got her down, she needs to deal with her problems
As the drama gets deeper, I put on the reefer
Took the last step and sent his ass to the reefer
Chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
Scared of herself and the power that was in her
It took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
Militant insanity is now what controlled her
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without
We're in love [x2]
Kill it!
Before it reaches you
Missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
What if it reaches the metropolitan areas, cosmopolitan areas
Secure the lines and prepare for departure, calm, calm, calm
It is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
Cause my style is underground
I'm green with my red eyes mad tint
Flee, fly, flow, rapido rapido
She feeds plentiful
Electrifying the nation [x2]
Don't you see that we are in danger
How will we stop it
She is attacking [x2]
Shocka, danger danger [x4]
Running out we're running out
Running all the time [x4]
It's alright we're in love
Can't live with or without.

I got a problem with the snakes that got crawlin'
Through my area when the darkness has fallen
And Mama told me that they love to bite
Bite you in the back no shame that's right, what, what
I keep my distance 'cause they're makin' me crazy
Stealin' from me, you know those fuckers are lazy
My blood boils, fat turns to oil
Step the fuck back or you'll get buried in soil
Over trauma, or you could sleep with the fishes
My clutches are tight and I'll take your last wishes
1 for your money
2 for your girl
3 for your life
Now I fucked-up your world
Do you like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
I don't like how it feels check it
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
Break it down
Yo, it's kinda funny how you're runnin' your mouth man
You're caught in a lie and then there's no way out, come on
Betray your friends and your peeps and your family
Livin' like a snake Livin' like a bloody thief
Check my speech, 'cause it's deep like the sea
From me to y'all, and then from y'all back to me, Ha!
Danger danger, I slay snakes like a ranger
Military style fears god not a stranger
Now tell me, tell me who's crew's sicker?
Mine's sicker, get on your knees to be a dick licker
1 for your money
2 for your girl
3 for your life
Now I fucked-up your world
Check it!
Do you like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
I don't like how it feels, check it
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels!
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
What the fuck is up?
Do you like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
Do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
By the snake that kills
By the snake that kills.

Life's been sucked out of me, this routine's killing me.
I did it to myself, again I said this would not be.
Somebody put me out of my misery.
Expression, stimulation, hallow sense of myself.
I did it to myself again. Somebody put me in my place...
Never Enough. Never Enough.
Do I deserve what I got?
Now everything's okay, there's nothing wrong with me.
This seems unnatural, to me I'd say it every way.
Somebody kick me in my face.
Now something's wrong with me.
I'm bleeding profusely and this seems natural.
To me I fuck-up everyday. Somebody put me in my place...
Never Enough. Never Enough.
Do I deserve what I got?
Never Enough. Never Enough.
Do I deserve what I got?
What I got.
What I got.
What I got.
What I got.
I feel as if I'm running back to where I started.
Ask what's wrong with me &amp; I say nothing.
Is everything okay? Is something wrong with me?
Pushing and pulling feelings, eternal my heart is yours
I feel as if I'm running, I feel as if I'm running
I feel as if I'm running...
Run!
Life will knock me down!
Never Enough. Never Enough.
Do I deserve what I got?
Never Enough. Never Enough!
Life will knock me down!

All I need is a bottle
And I don't need no friends, no
Wallow in my pain
I swallow as I pretend
To act like I'm happy
When I drink 'til no end, no.
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end.
She says
"Behave little boy, you better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground."
When I'm sober life bores me 
So I get drunk again
Yeah.
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end.
She says
"Behave little boy
You better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground."
Yeah!
You better sit back down.
You better put that down.
Put the bottle down.
I am on a Binge!
"Behave little boy
You better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground.
It's your turn to learn to fight!
You better sit back down
'Til you hold your ground."
Yeah!
I am on a Binge
I wish things would change
Wish they'd rearrange
I'm on a Binge
I wish things would change 
Wish they'd rearrange 
I am on a Binge.
I'm on a Binge! Yeah, yeah.

I am a mess
I made a huge mess
I can't control myself!
I kill the rhyme again 
I'm comin' sick and on time again 
Words manifest from deep inside where people hide within'
It's chemical
Unbalanced on the triple beam. What? 
Fuck what ya heard
It's about what I seen 
I seen it happen
Back hand brand to face smackin'
Definite disorder now his mindset is blackened 
The doctors say he got the brain of a murderer 
This rugged style steals your brain
My heart is bleeding
And this pain it will not pass
It's not receding
And my body's going numb
A bad trip child
Rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
He just keeps getting by
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
He's born sick
Nothing in his hands but his dick
He couldn't handle pressure
He couldn't handle shit
For the life he was leading led him down the wrong path 
Where guns blast
Don't give a shit about the gods' wrath 
Don't want to talk to the counselor Doctor 
To tell him what's real
To tell him what's proper
Situation's unclear like gray
And I know it gets worse everyday
My heart is bleeding
And this pain will not pass
It's not receding
And my body's going numb
A bad trip child
Rolling stoned keeping high
He don't know what he's doing
He just keep getting by away
Thrown away
I want to be thrown away
I am a mess
I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself!
I'm losing it
I've lost it
I've spilt all my marbles!
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
A hyper spaz and that is me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Don't tell me to do it 'cause I will, no!
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Don't tell me to do it 'cause I will, no!
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
They're screaming
They're screaming
They're screaming

My words are weapons, in which I murder you with.
Please don't be scared; please do not turn your head.
We are the future the 21st century dyslexic glue sniffing cyber sluts.
With homicidal minds &amp; handguns.
We are insane. Nothing will change.
We are insane. Nothing will change.
There is a thin line between what is good &amp; what is evil.
And I will tiptoe down that line but I will feel unstable.
My life is a circus &amp; I am trippin' down that Tightrope.
Well there is nothing to save me now.
So I will not look down.
And again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; it happens again &amp; again &amp; again.
There's no beginning. There is no end.
There is only change.
Progression backwards is this where we are heading.
Take back your soul. Forget your emptiness.
There is a thin line between what is good &amp; what is evil.
And I will tiptoe down that line but I will feel unstable.
My life is a circus &amp; I am trippin' down that Tightrope.
Well there is nothing to save me now.
I'm falling to the ground.
Falling to the ground. Down to the ground. Yeah.
I speak of madness, my heart &amp; soul.
I cry for people who ain't got control.
Let's take our sanity, let's take compassion.
And be responsible for ever reaction.
Hell no, no how, no way, no way, no way, no how.
No way no how.
There is a thin line between what is good &amp; what is evil.
And I will tiptoe down that line but I will feel unstable.
My life is a circus &amp; I am trippin' down that Tightrope.
Well there is nothing to save me now.
So I will not look down.

My life is a circus &amp; I am trippin' down that Tightrope.
Well there is nothing to save me now.
I'm falling to the ground.
Down to the ground. All the way down. Hittin' &amp; I'm dead.

Dead president, fuck the president
Nations strive for power
While I work to save my residence
He owns you even though he never told you
Mark of the beast on your hand
Now he owns you
Thrown down to the bottom level
Ruled by the fist
And the fist is a devil
I metamorphosis, make myself level.
We are the future
We are right now.
Right now, I'm takin' a stab at the sic, sic, sic
I know what evil is &amp; evil could suck my dick
Like Sam Hain &amp; the God ain't no joke
Better watch your neck
'Cause you might get choked.
We are the future
We are right now.
Fuck the future.
You sink we swim
We rise you fall
We meet our fate together
I was here from the start
And I'll be here in the end.
In the end.
I'm dodgin' arrows from the dark side every day
And I'm a main target 'cause of what I say
If I nearly always go against the grain
And crushin' everything before it takes your brain.
Thrown down to the bottom level
Ruled by the fist
And the fist is a devil
I metamorphosis, make myself level.
Yeah, Come on!
Yeah, Come on!
We are the future
We are right now.
Fuck the future.
You sink we swim
We rise you fall
We meet our fate together
I was here from the start
And I'll be here in the end.
In the end.
Legacy.

I was here from the start.
And I'll be here in the end.
In the end.
Legacy.

Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb
What is your target? What is your reason?
Do you have emotions? Is your heart freezing?
Seizin', this opportunity to speak
You didn't say nothin' but turn your fuckin' cheek
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Sick in the head, living but dead
Hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, nutty warrior, nothin's scarier
Kids are gettin' sick like malaria
Situation gets hairier
I'm throwing up all types of barriers
I'm tellin' you
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the Dead Cell shout
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
Stop pointing fingers 'cause we all are guilty
Of clean cut lies and the truth that's filthy
Believe what is the root of the word
Out comes lie when it's cut into thirds
I don't believe what my eyes behold, No!
I don't believe what my ears are told, No!
Seizin, this opportunity to speak
I'm saying something don't turn your fuckin' cheek!

This music is my time
To relax and rewind
I'll be brutal with truth
And I'll be honest with my soul
Be the pile of trash
A bum picks through to get a bite to eat
I'm filthy
I'm horny
I'm dirty nasty dirty
I'm strong and fearless
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm knee-deep in our blood
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
Come on
Baby come on
Yeah
Baby come on
Baby come on
Break it
Break it
Break it
Break it
I'm strong and fearless
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm knee-deep in our blood
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm crazier than I ever was
I'm blooded up I beat my skull in
Comin' home in a body bag
And I'm ready to try for rock 'n' roll
I can't change the world
I can only change myself
I'm as sharp as a knife
As high as a kite
Demented as the night is long
I'm strong and fearless
Only 'cause I got rock 'n' roll
I'm not sheddin' a tear
I'm blowin' some steam
Stuck in between
Livin' a dream
Livin' a dream
Come on
Baby come on.
Yeah
Baby come on
Baby come on.

Burn!
Pentex sucks, Pentex sucks!
They burn the life force of my tribe
Pentex sucks!
Bonegnawers suck, bonegnawers suck!
They roll around in garbage bins
All bonegnawers suck!
(Pentex breeding, night is darkening)
The Black Hand sucks, the Black Hand sucks!
Those wyrm tainted bastard leeches, Black Hand sucks!
If I had my way! If I had my way!
I'd rend them all, ripped and torn
All that sucks dies!
(Sweet smell bleeding, glow is melting me)
I bring my klave into battle
Shifting into Crinos
I slay Wyrmfoe, then I step sideways...
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra

Gently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure...
A pleasure that will take my mind off the realities of my life...
My past life...
Life as I know it now!
And whatever may come, it slowly disappears!
To somewhere in the back of my mind...
And it will remain there... till I wish to retrieve it!
Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break!
A break from the pressures of life!
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands!
Life's hands!
This mode is incredible! It's out of this world!
Too bad I must always leave it...
That's life That's Life...
That's life That's Life...
That's life That's Life...
That's life That's Life...
Shift... Shift... Shift... Shift... Shift...

The system has failed, and you have failed with it
No time to care, just time to say "Who gives a shit?"
My mind boils as I've decided I'm through
Fuck your position in life, I'm taking vengeance on you...
I break down the walls of the political arena
Cast the vote on fn-fal, yeah, we'll be seeing ya!
Come on y'all!
Yeah!
I want to put a cap right in your asshole
You step to this, you're gonna pass for a lump of dogshit in the grass, now, be on your way and get some class
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Bitch-slap
Man, you're like a school in the summer, no class
Chop down the big-wigs, shoot the televisions, too
My mind boils on life as I've decided I'm through!
The guilty of crimes will be hung from the trees!
Spit and punches arise from you and from me!

Pain, made to order! 
Pain, made to order! 
Pain, made to order! 
Pain!
Slipping, slapping, scatting on my back, trying to relax 
Thinking about the facts of the crack running through the pack 
Division in thought about the war to be fought 
For trying to mend the ranks, still I get no thanks 
They say they mean no disrespect, but this is in effect 
I take to heart the part I play everyday 
Uninformed is one thing, stupid is another 
Keep running your mouth, but don't call me brother!
I'm trying to find someone on my side 'cause banging heads all the time starts to grind at my gears and at my will 
But persistent I am still 
So when one insubordinate fucker tries to test me 
Blow to the head, then an entrail rend 
Guts on the floor, do you want more?
Show you the strength of the tenth rank 
Pain is the only way to teach kids these days! 
Opened your eyes. You've realized. 
Talk back to me. Your punk-ass dies! 
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
I'm all you know! Where will you go?
Valhalla's gone, with your soul!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks the fuck away!
Only one of us walks the fuck away!
Only one of us walks the fuck away!
Only one of us walks the fuck away!

Kill Me!
Tattered and Torn!
That's where my soul is worn...
Tattered and Torn!
That's when I was born...
Tattered and Torn!
I broke away from me
Tattered and Torn!
I knocked me to my knees!
Tattered and Torn!
I drink my own cells...
Tattered and Torn!
A decomposing well...
Tattered and Torn!
Roaches in my head...
Tattered and Torn!
I become the living dead!
Tattered and Torn!

Tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
Tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
Tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
Tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
Tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
Tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
Tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
Tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!

I know you don't want to see...
I know you're not part of me...
But you wonder just the same...
So I'll let you in on this game
What's on top is just the beginning of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning.
It never ends, with the gifts Luna sends to the Apocalypse
On we defend for the right to live in a perfect world
For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled
Trying to make amends for the Impergium
As the Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm!
You don't want to know
All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
You don't want to see
Our viewpoint on what Hobbits are doing, The black inside when frenzy is brewing
You don't want to feel
The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going
I won't let you be
Caught up in a war that you are not part of, I sign this letter: "Your father, with love"
I'm trying to set my mind free, I'm sorry you never knew me
My soul is in recession, Painful to make this confession.
You don't want to know
All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
You don't want to see
Our viewpoint on what Hobbits are doing, The black inside when frenzy is brewing
You don't want to feel
The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going
I won't let you be
Caught up in a war that you are not part of, I sign this letter: "Your father, with love!"
Love!

Some feel I don't exist, never believing what they see! 
Some feel that I'm not fair, I leave no time for repentance!
Tearing the vail, mending the vail
Tearing the vail...
Tearing the vail, mending the vail
Tearing the vail!
Some feel I bare the mark of man!
A misguided philosophy!
Some feel I kill for fun!
I kill for life...
I can't escape what Gaia's left for me!
I can't deny a lack of morality!
I can't believe what Gaia's left for me! (No more)
I can't deny a lack of morality! (No less)
Need time to think, need time to think
Need to spill blood so I can drink
Take what they give take what they give
Some feel I'm dead yet still I live
Need time to think, need time to think!
Need to spill blood so I can drink!
Take what they give take what they give!
Some feel I'm dead yet still I live!
No!
They don't know I'm eternal!
They don't know they're just cattle!
They don't know I'm eternal!
Eternal!

Cycle of life and death supposedly 
Goes round and round yet it stops with me
Glorious Hunter of my faith I have sinned
Killers are quiet like the breath of the wind
Filling the shadows with forms of my own
Raised by kindred of get I was born
Abomination world in disarray
Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae
Reflection beckons a portal shard
Spiritual quest I must stay on guard
Stepping sideways betweens worlds I shift
Killers are quiet when they are born with the gift
Beautiful anguish cast out by my race
Now one that's ageless I save my own face
I write my own laws with death I break bread
Killers are quiet when they come from my head.

The whole thing, I think it's sick

Pain
"Here comes the pain"
Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything, even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way, it better be
Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
What the hell am I saying?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're going down, this is a war
Fuck it
Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leaving me suspect? I'm leaving you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass, suffer
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're going down, this is a war
Go
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me, 'cause I'm already inside you
Sick
Sick

Yeah

Yeah
Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone, say you'll do it, but never will
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
I am my father's son, 'cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
Yeah
I tried, you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if a I give a shit, it's shit that you gave me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
Yeah
Do you wanna feel pain? Taking my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I feel safe
Seems you're saved
I feel safe (safe)
Seems you're saved
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Motherfucker
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
Good bye
I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3-D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
Get outta my head, 'cause I don't need this
Why didn't I see this?
But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just making my mind up and taking your breath away
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
Good bye
You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
And it waits for you

Fuck you all
Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in
Fuck it all, fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong, don't exist
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me
Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in
Fuck it all, fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong, don't exist
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me
And don't you fucking touch me
Burn
You got all my love living in your own hate
Dripping hole, man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothing, but I ain't holding back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this, 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
Fuck it all, fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong, don't exist
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me
Fuck it all, fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong, don't exist
Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me
"No"
Burn

Did you never give a damn in the first place?
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved
I got the problem solved and the verdict is guilty
Man, nearly killed me, stepping where you fear to tread
Stop, drop, and roll, you were dead from the get-go
Big motherfucker, stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya, think I fear you, bullshit
Just another dumb punk chomping at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity, Hit me
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
Keeping all your little spies and leaving when you realize
Step up, fairy, I guess it's time to bury your ass with a chrome straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good, just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab, don't you know who you're dissing?
Sideswipe, we know the ass that you're kissing!
Biggety-biggety bitch-boy, halfway hauser
Don't hear shit, 'cause it keeps getting louder
Come up and you get a face full o' tactic
Lipping off hard? Going home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothing
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that something
Payoffs don't protect and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you, coming up behind you
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needle-nose punching is making me irate
Sick of my bitching falling on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam, are you sick of me? Good enough, had enough
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Fuck me, I'm all out of enemies
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is slice you up
Spit

Something aches

Bad things slither

My floors are burning down
Tattered and torn
And I can't find a window
Tattered and torn
This is medieval

This is cerebral

Suffocated

Melodramatic

Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
Put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't-
Lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging
I am in a buried kennel, I have never felt so final
Someone find me, please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't-
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise
Cut me, show me, until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise
Despise, depise

Liberate my madness (One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness, I just want to
Liberate my madness (One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
Section off myself, put a wall up, what the hell have I done?
Keep the dog at bay, survive by saving me
Values and the game, not a fuck up, not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond
Stand off of the shit, back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget (Your garbage in is garbage out)
You don't give a shit, I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this (Your garbage in is garbage out)
(Liberate my madness)
Liberate my madness (One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness, I just want to
Liberate my madness (One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I am not ashamed, what is vital isn't always humane
You can break in vain, but you can't break away
Even in my face, lotta bullshit, not a lotta the truth
I can't see from here, but I can smell your fear
Back off of the shit, stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget (Your garbage in is garbage out)
You don't give a shit, I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this (Your garbage in is garbage out)
Burn
Saved? You're such a slave, I don't expect a name
You don't care, I wasn't witness
I can't be part of a system such as this
Hard eyes glow right in my darkness again
With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness, fuck this
How long have I had this? 
I don't need this, outta my business
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
Fraud
Fraud
Fraud
Liberate my madness
Liberate my madness, I just want to
Liberate my madness
Liberate my madness

Even if you will run, I will find you
I decided I want you, now I know, I need
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought
Keep in mind, I'm with you
Never left out fate, can't concentrate
Even if you run
You will be mine
Ah, fucking you will be mine
Ah, fucking you will be mine
Ah, fucking you will be mine
I found you leaning out of an open window
You laughed, our fingers clenched
Too perfect, far too careless
I couldn't help myself, I just took you
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
Better make yourself at home, you're here to stay
You won't bother me if you let me bother you
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut
Keep in mind, I watch you
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker
Even if you run
What the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this
And what the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this
And what the fuck is different, man? I can't believe I'm doing this

My freedom is best, whole country's on house arrest and everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died, face-down on a suicide
The motherfucker's on self-destruct, nobody guarding your back, it's all a front
Save this, my rage is bliss, I'm taking names and getting pissed
Where's Chuck D when you need him?
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so, just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell, better back the fuck on up, 'cause this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life (You can't blame me)
Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
Bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe, amber-cult, breathe, one more, seethe, freak like you got a pair
Won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a no-good life, this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life (You can't blame me)
I can't remember, I don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you till someone forgives you, I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under, you're making it perfectly clear
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right, never had peace, but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
You're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question, the price is too human for fucking sake, this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me
I can't be, I can't be, I can't be blamed

I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie
It itches, it seethes; It festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd and squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again
Thoughts of me exemplified
All the real flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Every day, I see a little more overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease while my symptoms increase
God, what the fuck is wrong?
You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing
All I ever wanted out of you was something you could never be
Now take a real good look at what you've fucking done to me
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
"I haven't got time for the living; I haven't got time for the living"
Give me any reason why I'd need you (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you (boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you (bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you (bitch)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I keep my scars from prying eyes
Incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things
But I don't care what you think, you'll never understand me
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
Fuck

Pain, made to order!
Pain, made to order!
Pain, made to order!
Pain!
I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave!
Better get an army, 'cause the fire left me unscathed
You bet your bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around, 'cause I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the "Achtung!", get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself; are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only motherfucker; top of the world, man
'Cause I can't stand it, planned, gonna crash-land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels, what you gonna do?
All I hear is human noise!
You made your own fucking choice!
I belong to only me!
Silence for my revelry!
I can only die over time!
Filthy hands, stay away from mine!
Every reason is a right to hate!
Painful clutch, death is fine, give me mine!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Somebody explain this?
You don't care, 'cause you don't exist!
What the fuck, is this another joke?
Reckoning!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away! Walks away!
Only one of us walks away! Walks away!
Only one of us walks away! Walks away!
Only one of us walks away! Walks away!

I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout
As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candy heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
Biding my time until the time is right...

Come on down and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I've got a fucking
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead!
One more time, motherfucker!
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it...
Blood's on my face and my hands and I don't know why
I'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business!
Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it!
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cause I don't wanna die in this place!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!

Cause I'm not afraid of you!

I'm everything you'll never be!

It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion; I'm sitting at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Yeah? Overdo it; Don't tell me; You blew it?
Stop your bitching and fight your way through it
I'm not like you, I just fuck up
Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die
Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die!

Goddammn right!

Hold on to something!
I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
Wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
Wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
Cause a line gets crossed when you don't come clean
My wormwood meets your pesticide
You'll never get out, cause you were never alive
I am infinite, I am the infant finite
Come a little closer and I'll show you why
No one is safe!
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing!
No one is safe!
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing!
How does it feel to be locked inside another dream
That never had a chance of being realized?
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'll tell you what you're looking at
Everyone you ever fucking laughed at!
Look in my eyes for the answers, typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to power them
Once again, it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else!
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
And it's shaking; You'll never take me
No one is safe!
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing!
No one is safe!
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!

(Hate) Hate ain't enough to describe me
(Scream) Somewhere between screaming and crying
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
(Why) When do I get to know why?
(Bitter) Bitter as the stink of when I try
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
No!
Pull your hands away...
I'm gone; Goodbye; It's so depressing
Withering away, take a look inside; My soul is missing
All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me
I feel like I'm erased, So kill me just in case
I feel like I'm erased, So kill me just in case
So kill me just in case!
(Covet) Everything around me's mine
(Sty) Can't see through the sties in my eyes
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
(Down) Scratching and clawing all the way
(Stay) You won't let me fucking stay
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
(Live) Is there another way to live?
(Die) 'Cause it's the only way to die
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
Come on!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be!

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday bullshit things that you have done!
Your impossible ego-fuck is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is...
That's all you'll ever know!
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it
I can't just drop it!
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it
At least I admit it!
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself!
Yeah!
Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you (you!)
Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you (you!)
I can't fucking take it anymore
A snap of the synapse and now it's fucking war!
Kill you; Fuck you! I will never be you (you!)
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you blame me...
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you blame yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!

You are wrong, fucked and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
Shallow skin, I can paint with pain
I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
Everyday it's the same; I love, you hate
But I guess I don't care anymore
Oh, fix my problems with the blade
While my eyes turn from blue to gray
God, the worst thing happened to me today
But I guess I don't care anymore? Wrong
(Fuck)
You are wrong, fucked and overrated
Think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
My flaws are the only thing left that's pure
Can't really live, can't really endure
Everything I see reminds me of her
God, I wish I didn't care anymore
The more I touch, the less I feel
I'm lying to myself that it's not real
Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal?
It's never gonna appear anymore
You are wrong, fucked and overrated
Think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
You're wrong and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
Suffer
What the hell am I doing?
Is there anyone left in my life?
What the fuck was I thinking?
Anybody want to tell me I'm fine?
Where the hell am I going?
Do I even need a reason to hide?
I am only betrayed
I am only conditioned to die
You are wrong, fucked and overrated
Think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
You're wrong and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

Yeah!
I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super-dread-bet with an angel drug-head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
I'm curios man, that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's suisonic, it's pornaholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be
If you're 555, then I'm 666!

What's it like to be a heretic?
Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody deformates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look in my face like I'm somebody new
Toy; Nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine, because you're made of everything I'm not!
If you're 555, then I'm 666!
If you're 555, I'm 666!

I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me!
Go ahead and lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured?
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well?
You're full of shit!
You had a dream, but this ain't it!
If you're 555, I'm 666!

Yeah!

Gently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure...
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life...
My past life...
Life as I know it now!
And whatever may come, it slowly disappears!
To somewhere in the back of my mind...
It will remain there... 'til I wish to retrieve it!
Yeah!

Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break!
A break from the pressures of life!
And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands!
Life's hands!
Yeah!
This mode is incredible! It's out of this world!
Too bad I must always leave it...
That's life Yeah!
That's life Yeah!
That's life Yeah!
That's life Yeah!
Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes

I've known faces that have disappeared in time
Find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime
All my friends have pictures made to make you cry
I've seen this and wondered what I've done to calcify!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!
I can't stand to see your thalidomide robot face
I don't even try it
You had to be a liar just to infiltrate me
I'm still drowning!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!
Take... this... away
Take... this... away
I can feel it on my mouth
I can taste you on my fingers
I can hear you like the holy ghost
And kill you if you get too close!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!
I ignore you!
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come towards you!
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away!

But you cause me pain 'most every time you breath, cryin' eyes
Cause me pain every, every time you breath

(Lean forward slightly
Look straight at the speaker
And listen with a sparkle in your eye
As though you might be thinking
"Gee, this is the most wonderful thing I ever heard in all my life.")
Back in the day, we were eye-to-eye
The thought of you had me runnin' wild
They say love lost will never grow
But hey hey, I still love you so
Oh, when we met, you know the sun did shine
From your eyes back into mine
Oh if the sun, it shine no more
A-hey hey, I still love you so
I beg the moon and the stars above
Bring me back my that gal I love
I know you're gone, you're gone for sure
But hey hey, I still love you so
Hey

Run me down in the winter, run me down in the spring
Got to the place, can't do a goddamn thing
But after a while, you ain't gonna run me down anymore
Run me down in the city, run me down on the farm
Run me with your eyes, and your witty charm
But after a while, you ain't gonna run me down anymore
I do for you, you don't do for me
You run me down, to where you want me to be
But after a while, you ain't gonna run me down anymore

Goin' upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk
Ain't seen no whiskey, woman make me sloppy
Seen no whiskey, woman made me drunk
Goin' back home, where I have much better luck
Look here darlin', want me to be your kid
Say you can't darlin', gotta keep it hid
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here

Thoughts of her won't let me be

She said, "I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad."
And she's makin' me feel like I never was born
I said, "Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel like I'm mad
And you're makin' me feel like I never was born."
She said, "You don't understand what I've said."
I said, "No, no, no, you're wrong. When I was a boy
Everything was right, everything was right."
I said, "Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're makin' me feel like I never was born."
She said, she said

Well I'm goin' out east darlin', hope you burn in hell

"But there is one voice that has never been heard before, the voice of old Mr. World himself. The way he might sound if he could speak to us in our own language. Mr. World, how was this wonderful, orderly earth of ours formed in the first place and how long has it been going on?"
"I am the earth, the planet you call home. Scientists believe I am at least four and a half billion years old."
"(...) Jacksonville will leave tomorrow morning at 9:30 in the parking lot. We will be gone most of the day. You will take a lunch with us and I understand, uh, there will be three or four cars going."
"Scientists say some of us will learn to live on the moon."

Yeah,
No fun, my baby, no fun

Gonna make me understand
Hold me, love me, in your heart

If you wanna go and leave your man
Go on, I'll understand
But then the night gets dark, all is still
You'll pray for me, I know you will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
When you hit the city it swallow you whole
You got no friends darlin' to satisfy your soul
And then the sidewalk ends, lights are red
Say to yourself, "Better off dead"
Hard row to hoe all by yourself, yeah
Walk out on me, walk out on him
You need no man to do you in
But if the night gets dark, all is still
I'll pray for you, you know I will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
All by yourself, all by yourself, all by yourself
Hey

Visiting is pretty
Visiting is good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother
This can be a secret
We can keep it good
Even all the ever wanting had a problem
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking
Them balloons are pretty big
And say they should
Ever fall to ground, call the magic marker
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long
Minocin is pretty
Minocin is good
Even all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter
Ritalin is easy
Ritalin is good
Even all the ones who watered down the daughter
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long

I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true
That you'll see
How could it be, I'm the only one who sees
Your rehearsed insanity, yeah
I still refuse all the methods you abused
It's alright if you're confused
Let me be
I've been around all the pawns you gagged and bound
They'll come back and knock you down
And I'll be free
I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I had no hand in your ever-desperate plan
It returns and when it lands
Words are due
I should have known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown
You were too
I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it
Hey

When I talk about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or
Treasons all renew
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true
When I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you
I fell into
When I talked about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or
Treasons all renew
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true
Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into
Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into
I fell into
I fell into

They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Crazy T.V. dreams might be true
Not what it seems
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down the crown
Given the jewels and the answers of may
Thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
Run me out of town
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids
Wrapped around
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
Good grief
Good grief
Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down the crown
Given the jewels and the answers of may
Thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, come and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it

I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no shit
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Some try that hit
Beast and mud lead
Beast and mud lead
Big shit, no shit
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no duh
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
Right?
I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing

The train that I got onto up and left that town
Threw it up as it went down
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around
Watched as they all took their vows
Fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway
Phase it out until the older ones return
Have a seat and watch it burn
Trace around the corner this is what I've learned
Always waited for my turn
Fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway
Fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway

I'm called a cow
I'm not about to blow it now
For all the cows
For all the cows
It's funny how money allows 
All to browse and be endowed
This wish is true
It falls into peaces new
The cow is you, the cow is you
My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everthing worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend
I said you're all a painted doll
And it caused the walls to fall
How far is he?
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be
As far can be
My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everthing worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend
I'm called a cow
I'm not about to blow it now
For all the cows
It's funny how money allows 
All to browse and be endowed
And be endowed
My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everthing worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend

Leading everything along, never far from being wrong.
Nevermind these things at all, it's nothing.
Couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all I ever do.
Turning up in black and blue, rewarded.
All the static we all left.
Wait till the time has come, figure that's where time comes from.
Leaving all my senses numb, is heaven.
Lifted up the fatal scene, anything could never be.
Anything but play to me, in order.
All the static we all left.
Take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep.
Not that I had made that leap, anointed.
All the static we all left.
Where have all the wishes gone, now that all of that is done?
Wish I would've felt I've won, for once.

I stick it to the mailman
I'm pinned against a pot plant
I'm sick of all the sun-tan
Oily with the ray-ban
Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon
I'm skinny as a spit pan
Dealing with the shit plan
Playing with my bad hand
Just another rock band
Take that to the man
And call it a check
Trapped within a contract
Hey there boy while you were catching the black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose
I wanna swim in the watershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait
Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract
Hey man can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower
I wanna swim in the watershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait

I'm not around that much
Running exhausted and lost
If it could be undone
Will it have costed
It's taught and lost
Blowing away we stray, wilted
Insulted, at fault
What if the day had stayed in bed
These baubles we've brought
At fault
After the bliss has long ended
This caution this fault
Give me a breeze that's long winded
Accosted, adult arrested

How I miss you
How I miss you
How I miss you
I should never call
How I hope that you still miss me
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide and seek's all right if I find...
Do you miss me,
Like I miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully... you'll come stay someday
If you're leaving,
Come back soon
That's not easy to say
I will wait here,
And dream of you
All alone as I ache
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide and seek's all right if I find...
Do you miss me,
Like I miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully... you'll come stay someday
If you're leaving,
Come back soon
That's not easy to say
I will wait here,
And dream of you
All alone as I ache
How I miss you
How I miss you
How I miss you
I should never call
How I hope that you still miss me

Power is as sacred to that they never even teach
Only if it's black or white see the challenges
Open eyes are broken if you'd just consider me
Cut you loose, I feel like I gotta gotta go!..
Find a (n) answer help yourself
Find a (n) answer help yourself
Whatever kind of phony body chewed it through the night
Soda is left to block away the case of broken heart
Spit out fast for fun for it's the only way to win
Take my breathe come back inside, oh I gotta gotta go!
I got the answer help yourself
Find any answer help yourself
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself...

I'm the kind of
Guy who likes feelin'
High Feelin' high and dry,
And I really like to fly
I'm your kinda guy, girl
I'm not too shy
And I want you to fly,
So I think you oughta try
Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone
I'm your kinda guy and
I'm not too shy
Feelin' high and
Dry, and I want you to be mine
So I think it's time,
Girl, to start feeling fine
Feeling good all the time,
So I think you oughta try
Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone
Now I'm the kinda guy who
Likes getting high
Getting high and dry, and
I do it all the time
If you think it's a crime and
You don't wanna try
Something that'll make you high,
Then I think I'll say goodbye
'Cause I'm the kind of guy who likes
Getting high
Getting high and dry, and
I do it all the time
Now I'm much too high, I am
High and dry
And I'm feelin' fine, I'm feelin'
Good all of the time... (to fade)

You know in all of the times that we've shared
I've never been so scared
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there
I wish I never had taken this dare
I wasn't quite prepared
Doll me up in my bad luck
Uh, uh
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there

What have we done with innocence
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under the pressure wind up snapping in the end
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper
Temper
Temper
One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
(Fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
(Fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
(Fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench

Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruise's colors
Everything fades in time, it's true
Wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you
It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood
Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue
It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood
Mood
Mood
Now that I've found my reward
I'd throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mine with you
It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out
Sit and watch
Your every mood
Mood
Mood
Mood

Real life is so hard
We hide in the stars
That's where our heads are
My head and your heart
This is a black out
Don't let it go to waste
This is a black out
I want to detonate
When you are so far
I'm falling apart
Lose all my sonar
You jam my radar
This is a black out
Don't let it go to waste
This is a black out
I want to detonate
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck
Between the handshake and the fuck
You've got me on guard
I've got my head start
My head and your heart
The same in the stars
This is a black out
Don't let it go to waste
This is a black out
I want to detonate
Sometimes I wish that I could change
I can't save you from my poor brain
Brain
Brain
Brain
Okay

I have a choice between the bat and the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confession, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind but I don't mind because I'll catch up
Want a song that's indelible like Manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
Will I be happy on the back of the shelf
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
Spare me your questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize that I get shy and I choke up
Want a song that's indelible like Manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up
Farewell my sweet paramania
Farewell my sweet paramania
My only promise is that I'll never tell
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
I take it all back anyway, what was I supposed to say?
Want a song that's indelible like Manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

The rain is here and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
The rain is here and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
Together now I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart it falls apart
For you to mend
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again

Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Kudos my hero
Leave them all the mess
You know my hero
The one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

These notes are marked "return to sender"
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew
How good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm getting further from myself
One thing is always true
How good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm done resenting you
You represented me so well
And this I promise you
How could I end up in the hands of someone else

I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lily
Best I'd ever seen
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be
Enough space

Hanging on
Here until I'm gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on
Even though
Watched you come and go
How was I to know
You'd steal the show?
One day I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call
Bet it all
Hanging on
Here until I'm gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on
Even though
Pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown
It heals the soul
You ask for walls
I'll build them higher
We'll lie in shadows of them all
I'd stand but they're much too tall
And I fall
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head she sang
Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You got to promise not to stop when I say when

Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud
Things just won't do without you, matter of fact
Ooh, I'm on your back, I'm on your back
Ooh, I'm on your back
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
If you'd accept surrender, give up some more
Weren't you adored
I cannot be without you, matter of fact
Ooh, I'm on your back, I'm on your back
Ooh, I'm on your back
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
Another heart is cracked in two, I'm on your back, ooh
I cannot be without you, matter of fact
Ooh, I'm on your back
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you
Another heart is cracked in two, I'm on your back, ooh
Ooh, ooh

See that girl 
Bare-footing along 
Whistling and singing 
She's a-carrying on 
There's laughing in her eyes 
Dancing in her feet 
She's a neon-light diamond 
And she can live on the street 
Hey-hey, hey

Hey-hey, hey 
Come right away

Won't be back till the fall

Well this job I've got is just a little too hard
Running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning Lord, gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line
I'm going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Going down the line
Beat it on down the line
Yes I'll be waiting at the station Lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I belong
I'm going back to that same old used-to-be
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Coal mine (coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack, way across that railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
Got a sweet woman, Lord, and she's waiting there for me
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
Happy home (happy home)
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home

Well she's coming down the stairs, combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this-a-way
This-a-way
And I ain't gonna be treated this-a-way
Well she went up to her room and she sang a fateful tune
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Well I married me a wife, she's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blonde-headed woman, she's the cause of it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
Saw her in Dallas, in El Paso
So come back baby, I need you so
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

No, no, she can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all, it's more than enough to pay for your lie
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah
Well, can't you see that you're killing each other's soul
You're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Your constant battles are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war

Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today
Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway
I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I thought I heard a young man morn today
I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Guess it doesn't matter anyway

I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
Well well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

(next 3 verses sung in '60s and early '70s)
If you're ever in Memphis
Better stop by Minglewood
If you're ever in Memphis
Better stop by Minglewood
Well take a walk down town
The women sure look good
If you can't believe me
Don't make it hard to believe in you
If you can't believe me
Don't make it hard to believe in you
'Cause we all need each other
Well you know it's true
I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den

Well my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas
Busted jail and I'm gone for good
Yes, I'm a wanted man in Texas
Busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Now, the doctor call me crazy
Some says I am some says I ain't
Yes and the doctor call me crazy
Some says I am some says I ain't
Yes and the preacher man call me a sinner
But his little girl call me a saint
Well, a couple of shots of whiskey
Women 'round here start looking good

Women 'round here start looking good
Couple more shots of whiskey

Raised in a lion's den

Where the little girls know what to do

The judge decreed it 
The clerk he wrote it 
Clerk he wrote it 
Down indeed-ee
Judge decreed it 
Clerk he wrote it down 
Give you this jail sentence 
You'll be Nashville bound 
Some got six month 
Some got one solid 
Some got one solid 
Year indeed-ee
Some got six month 
Some got one solid year 
But me and my buddies 
All got lifetime here 
I wrote a letter 
I mailed in the air 
Mailed it on the 
Air indeed-ee 
I wrote a letter 
I mailed in the air 
You may know by that 
I've got a friend somewhere

The other day they waited
The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
"He has to die
You know he has to die"
And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he has to die
The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter
And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die
Spanish lady come to me
She lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day
Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land
Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die
He had to die
You know he had to die
He had to die
Well, you know he had to die

Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born,
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud,
Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone,
All graceful instruments are known.
When the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone,
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own,
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
This ground on which the seed of love is sown,
All graceful instruments are known.

It seems I have been here before
Fuzzy then and still so obscure (good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye)
And I don't want to see anybody cry
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)
(Sing to me) 
Song coming on (your sweet loving bring to me)
So pleasing to see, come and gone (good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye)
You don't have to tell me why
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)
It ain't 'cause I'm the only one left, darling
'Bout the time the sun rises west
Feeling groovy, looking fine
Think I'll come back here again
Every now and then, from time to time
My, how lovely you are, my dear
The ball game has gone much too far, my dear
Sing to me, do your thing to me 
(Hop along honey, come along)
(Aren't you funny honey, well alone)
Meet me some morning now, meet me some morning
In the sweet by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye) by and by, (bye)

Sleepy Alligator in the noonday sun
Lying by the river just like he usually done (oh no)
Call for his whiskey, he can call for his tea
Call all he want to but he can't call me (oh no)
Oh no, well I've been there before
And not coming back around there no more
Hung up waiting for a windy day
Hung up waiting for a windy day
Creepy alligator coming all around the bend
Talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
I'll check my memory and I check it again, yes I will
I checked it running some old kind of trick (oh no)
Oh no! Well I've been there before
And I ain't coming back around there no more, no I'm not
Riding down the river in an old canoe
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
Out of the river all ugly and green
The biggest old alligator that I've ever seen
Teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
Contracted the union, put the beggars to rout
Screaming and yelling, he was picking his chops
He never runs he just stumbles and hops
Just out of prison on six dollars bail
Mumbling bitches and wagging his tail
Alligator running 'round my door
Alligator running 'round my door
Alligator running 'round my door
Alligator running 'round my door
Alligator's creeping in and he's crawling around on my cabin floor
He's coming round to bother me some more
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator
Alligator

I went down one day
I went down one day to see a Gypsy woman
Just one old day, yes I did
I want to find out, I want to find out, I want to find out now
What's wrong with me and my baby
We ain't been getting down like we used to do
I mean it's pretty good now
But there was a time
When it didn't work too well
I went down to see this Gypsy woman, you understand
And I told her my story, I told her what was going on
And she told me, man she said ah
"All you need, all you need
All you need, all you need
All you got to have"
"All you need...
...Just a touch"
She said "all you got to have, oh Lord"
"Just a touch of Mojo's hand", oh bring it back on
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed

Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a-crawling, calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

When I was just a little young boy,
Papa said son, you'll never get far,
Tell you the reason, if you wanna know,
Cause child of mine, there isn't really far to go.
Well, baby baby wants a gold diamond ring,
Wants it more than any old thing,
Well when I get those jelly-roll blues,
Why I go and get anything in this world for you.
Down to the jewelry store packin' a gun,
Says, "Wrap it up I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said,
Dupree said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead".
Well you know son, you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,
Jelly-roll will drive you so mad.
Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said, "Judge you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said, "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree said, "Judge you know that seems to me to be about right".
Baby baby you gonna lose her sweet man,
Dupree come out with a losin' hand,
Baby's gonna weep it up for a while,
Then go out and find another sweet man's gonna treat her with style.
Judge said, "Son, I know your baby well,
But that's a secret I can never tell"
Dupree said, "Judge well it's well understood,
But you got to admit that sweet Jelly's so good".
Well you know son, you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,
Same old story and I know it's been told,
Some like Jelly Jelly, some like gold,
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get, baby a shinin' diamond ring.

Boots were of leather
A breath of cologne
Her mirror was a window
She sat quite alone
All around her
The garden grew
Scarlet and purple
And crimson and blue
She came and she went
And at last went away
The garden was sealed
When the flowers decayed
On the wall of the garden
A legend did say:
No one may come here
Since no one may stay

Da da da da da da da da da da da
Sitting in Mangrove Valley, chasing light beams
Everything wanders from baby to Z
Baby, baby, pretty young on Tuesday
Old, like a rum-drinking demon at tea
Baby, baby, tell me what's the matter
Why, why tell me, what's your why now?
Tell me, why will you never come home?
Tell me, what's your reason if you got a good one?
Everywhere I go, the people all know
Everyone's doing that rag
Everywhere I go, the people all know
Everyone's doing that rag
Take my line, go fishing for a Tuesday
Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea
Gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons
Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three
Rain gonna come but the rain gonna go
Stepping off sharply from the rank and file
Awful cold and dark like a dungeon
Maybe get a little bit darker 'fore the day
Hipsters, tripsters, real cool chicks, sir
'Cause everyone's doing that rag
Hipsters, tripsters, real cool chicks, sir
'Cause everyone's doing that rag
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset
No one is watching or standing in your shoes
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
Everything promised is delivered to you
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is
All the winter birds are winging home now
Hey, love, go and take a look around you
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now
But you can wade in the water and never get wet
If you keep on doing that rag
Wade in the water and never get wet
If you keep on doing that rag
One eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
And the aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
Come back here, baby Louise
And tell me the name of the game that you play
Is it all fall down? 
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down? 
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down? 
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down? 
Is it all go under?
Everywhere I go
The people all know
Everybody's doing that rag

Cold Mountain water, the jade merchant's daughter
Mountains of the Moon, Electra, bow and bend to me
Hi ho, the Carrion Crow, folderolderiddle
Hi ho, the Carrion Crow, bow and bend to me
Hey Tom Banjo
Hey a laurel
More than laurel you may sow
More than laurel you may sow
Hey the laurel
Hey the city in the rain
Hey, hey, hey the white wheat
Waving in the wind
20 degrees of solitude, 20 degrees in all
All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
Lost is a long and loneliest time, fairy Sybil flying
All along the, all along the Mountains of the Moon
Hey Tom Banjo
It's time to matter
The Earth will see you on through this time
The Earth will see you on through this time
Down by the water the Marsh King's Daughter
Did you know?
Clothed in tatters, always will be
Tom, where did you go?
Mountains of the Moon, Electra, Mountains of the Moon
All along the, all along the Mountains of the Moon
Hi ho, the Carrion Crow, folderolderiddle
Hi ho, the Carrion Crow, bow and bend to me
Bend to me

Look for awhile 
At the China Cat Sunflower
Proud-walking jingle 
In the midnight sun
Copper-dome Bodhi 
Drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy-quilt stargown
Through a dream night wind
Krazy Kat peeking 
Through a lace bandana
Like a one-eyed Cheshire
Like a diamond-eye Jack
A leaf of all colors plays
A golden string fiddle
To a double-E waterfall 
Over my back
Comic book colors 
On a violin river
Crying Leonardo words
From out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell
Beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle wing palace
Of the Queen Chinee

Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
The rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
Songbirds frozen in their flight
Drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
Calling... answer comes there none.
Go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always
Panes of crystal, eyes sparkle like waterfalls
Lighting the polished ice caverns of Khan,
But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
Wandered the child who was perfect as dawn?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
Racing rhythms of the sun
All the world revolves captured in the eye of Odin
Allah, pray, where are you now?
All Mohammed's men are blinded by the sparkling waters
Scheherazade gathering stories to tell
From primal gold fantasy petals that fall
But where is the child who played with the sun chimes?
And chased the cloud sheep to the regions of rhyme?
Stranded stream cries the south wind
Lost in the regions of lead
Shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.

Cosmic Charlie, how do you do?  
Truckin' in style along the avenue 
Dum-dee, dum-dee, doodley-doo  
Go on home, your mama's calling you 
Kalico Kahlia, come tell me the news 
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her 
Rosy red and electric blue 
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe 
Say you'll come back when you can 
Whenever your airplane happens to land 
Maybe I'll be back here too 
It all depends on what's with you 
Hung up waiting for a windy day 
Kite one ice since the first of February 
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow 
But standing here, I say I just don't know 
New ones coming as the old ones go 
Everything's moving here but much too slow now 
A little bit quicker and we might have time 
To say "How do you do?" before we're left behind 
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo 
The very last lately inquired about you 
It's really very one or two 
The first you wanted, the last I knew 
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel 
Less concerned about the deep unreal 
The very first word is "How do you do?" 
The last "Go home, your mama's calling you"
Calling you 
Calling you 
Calling you 
Calling you 
Calling you 
Go on home, your mama's calling you 
Calling you 
Go on home, your mama's calling you 
Calling you 
Go on home, your mama's calling you 
Go on home, your mama's calling you

Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion
Shall we go, you and I, while we can?
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes in the nights of goodbye
Shall we go, you and I, while we can
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?

High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender,
They're crawling to the sun.
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
Stark and shiny in the breeze.
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry neath the sky.
William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before.
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming.
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
Five men writing with fingers of gold,
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight,
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.

Without a warning you broke my heart,
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark cryin',
Said your love for me was dyin'
Come on babe, baby please
'Cause I'm beggin' you baby and I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it shine
Well I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darlin' to make things all right
So come on babe, baby please
And I'm beggin' you baby and I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it shine
Without a warning you broke my heart,
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark cryin',
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on babe, baby please
And I'm beggin' you baby, I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Hey, let shine, let it shine, let it
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
C'mon Get up now
Get up now
Get up now
Get up now
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon babe
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon baby

You know, death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
You look in the bed this morning, children
Find that your, mo-mother's gone
I said, death don't have no mercy in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land, in this land, yeah
Whoa! Come to your house, you know he don't stay long
You look in bed this morning, children 
You find that your brothers and sisters are gone
I said, death don't have no mercy in this land
Death will go in any family in this land
Death will go in any family in this land, in this land
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
You look in the bed on the morning, children
Find that your family's gone
I said, death don't have no mercy, no mercy in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land, in this land
Whoa! Come to your house, you know it don't take long
You look in bed this morning, children 
Find your brothers and sisters are gone
I said death don't, death don't have no mercy in this, in this land

Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
Won't you lay your head upon your savior's chest,
I love you all, but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
I would never ride, well, I would never ride (goodnight, goodnight)
But His rod and His staff, they comfort me (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood (goodnight, goodnight)
You know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good,
Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
I go walking in the valley of the shadow of death,
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa oh, what I want to know 
Is: are you kind?
It's a buck dancer's choice my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
Will you come with me?
God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is "don't tread on me"
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
Where does the time go?
I live in a silver mine
And I call it Beggar's Tomb
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Whoa oh, what I want to know:
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

You know you could've been a wonder 
Takin' your circus to the sky 
You couldn't take it on the tight rope 
No you had to take it on the side 
You always like it undercover 
Tucked in between your dirty sheets 
But no one's even listenin' to ya 
In between the hollers and the screams 
And I said now now hey hey 
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste 
In the black of the night till the red morning light 
You got your cozy little corner 
All night you're jammin' on your feet
Hangin' out just like a street sign 
And pull a twenty dollar trick 
I hear you're blowin' like a feather 
And then they rub it in your face 
Oh once they've had all their fun, hun 
You're at the bottom of the cage 
And I said now now hey hey 
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste 
In the black of the night till the red morning light 
And I said now now hey hey 
You're givin' all your cinnamon away 
That's not right 
Hey hey 
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste 
Uh hey 
Keep on givin' away and givin' it away (givin' it away) 
Hey hey 
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey 
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey 
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste 
In the black of the night till the red morning light 
And I said now now hey hey 
You're givin' all your cinnamon away 
That's not right 
Hey hey 
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste 
In the black of the night till the red morning light 
And I said now now hey hey 
You're givin' all your cinnamon away 
That's not right

On our way, so it seems, 
Blooming flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passing time, 
Got to get outside the city
In the morning all will see, 
Just how crazy young love can be
On our own away again, 
Don't get down my darlin'
I'm gonna tangle my face hair
I'm gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels
An' your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window -- I'm on your street
Miles away, so unclear, 
Almost lost it in Montana
Lets pull over, have us a choke
I love to watch you when your dancin'
I wonder if they ever dreamed 
They would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in bein' 19, 
Chasin' stars that are fallin'
I'm gonna tangle my face hair
I'm gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels
An' your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window -- I'm on your street
An' when that train heads home
They're gonna be so gone gone, 
You ain't never gonna see me
I'm-a gone gone, you ain't nothin' to me
An' when they shine them streets, 
They only find our song
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, 
I'm gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be buzzin' around in my high heels
And your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window, that's where I'll be
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, 
I'm gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock in the morning, they all cry to me
I'll be buzzin' around in my high heels
And your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window, that's where I'll be
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me

It's your life
Don't you let 'em tell you when to bat your eyes
You're the only one who's gonna sacrifice
Makes no difference if you're right or wrong
Take that ride
But I want your little sister by your side
Maybe little later we can all collide
Do our lovin' like a rollin' stone
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted
An innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Show your face
Livin' in the shadow like you got no name
Enough to make a little girly go insane
Be my guest an' let it out tonight
But it's ok
I know all about the little games you play
Shakin' your apple right in my face
Only want ya t'know that I'm beggin' for a bite
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted
An innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me
I'm gonna get your mamma
I'm gonna get your pa,
I'm gonna tell everybody
Just what I saw
So show your face (show your face)
Your little apple shake-a (show your face)
I know the love you give (show your face)
I know the love you take-a (show your face)
An innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
An innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be
Baby gonna give it like it used to be

Blistered, cracked, and bleeding
Cold, no one should know
Rain falls down a freezin'
And stickin' like a snow
Lingering suspicions
Screamin' in my head
Lies all mixed up with omissions
Aw welcome home again
It's too late for apologies 
They're falling at my feet
This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
An' then he lit up a cigarette
He decided to call up his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
I caught him laying with my girlfriend
An' now they're both dead
Dudes can be so cold when they're dead
Callin' all the neighbors
Time to make amends
Whiskey floods the table
Aw good friends 'til the end
An' they're makin' silly faces 
And it's tastin' bitter sweet
This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
An' then he lit up a cigarette
Decided to call up his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
An' now they're both dead
Dudes can be so cold when they're dead
It's too late for apologies 
They're falling at my feet
This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
An' then he lit up a cigarette
Decided to call up his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
(I) Caught him layin' with my girlfriend
An' now they're both dead
Dudes can be so cold when they're dead

Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers that are hangin' out at the bar
Near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On every thing that the momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near her
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
'Cause all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are they're [Incomprehensible] in a slab
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight
Ah, tonight, tonight, tonight
Ah, maybe tonight
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near her
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
Comes home on call, ain't now that peace?
Fingers in the dirt, spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth
Comes home on call, ain't now that peace?
Fingers in the dirt, and he's out spitting all his teeth
Spitting out
Said Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"

Little Mona Lisa laying by my side 
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime 
I feel too close to be losin' touch 
By givin' in, what am I givin' up? 
Am I losin' way too much? 
Hey 
California waiting 
Every little thing has gotta be just right 
But say, while you tryin' to save me,
A can a get back my lonely life?
I'm goin' so fast an' I can't slow down 
It's hard to get off when you're spinnin' 'round and 'round 
I gave ya the news but nothin's changed 
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away 
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game 
Hey 
California waiting 
Every little thing has gotta be just right 
But say, while you tryin' to save me,
A can a get back my lonely life?
Hey 
California waiting 
Every little thing's gotta be just right

A can a get back my lonely life?

Can't I get back to my lonely life

Spiral staircase goin' down
Paint your body red and brown
On our knees we'll feast on the sex show
Spiral staircase spiral staircase
Greasy haircuts a German Chinese girl
She gonna keep y'all busy tugging at my curl
An' get your act together
You better walk, walk, walk
An' we'll walk an' ya cannot run
They all came to the party and there's four to every stall
Gets frust-er-atin' just-a pissin' on this wall
Seems like there's another story bangin'
Around every step you fake

Paint your body red and brown
On our knees we'll feast on the sex show

Free -- that's all that she can bleed
That's why'll she'll never stay 
White -- bare naked in the night 
An' lookin' for some play 
Just another girl that wants to rule the world 
At any time or place 
And when she gets into your head 
You know she's there to stay 
You want it 
She's got it 
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind 
She's got your -- your pistol!
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind 
Slow -- she's burnin' in your soul 
With whispers in your ear 
It's okay, I'll give it anyway 
Just get me out of here 
You'll plead -- you'll get down on your knees 
For just another taste 
And when ya think she's let ya in 
That's when she fades away 
You want it 
She's got it 
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind 
She's got your -- your pistol!
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber gonna change your mind
You want it 
Well she's got it

Everybody wants to be a showman
Yeah they all got another one
Everybody think they got a genius
Everybody got me on the run
Sometimes I think they come here
Just so you can say that you can
And I can't get alone in my bathroom
I need to give myself a hand
Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin'
Creepin' underneath my skin
Fuck you and your flashbulbs
Snappin' my picture again
You drink all my whiskey
You steal all my smoke
And you're crowded all around me
Like I got nowhere to go
(Chorus) Eyes are gonna roll
Beggin' me to kill
Time for you to go
I'm-a-gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king runnin' at the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here no
You keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupine
You're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout line
Are ya true confessin' of your little girl obsession
'Cause I was only messin', an' I had a little time
Chorus... Chorus X2

Dusty and you are, dirty from chain
Lips of your kisses are sticking like tape
Woke you at sunrise, cold as a grave
I'll cut you some flowers, now don't be afraid
Now don't be afraid 
I'm looking for somethin', to sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothin', where thrills are cheap and love is divine
Home by the river, tall grassy fields, under a willow, where for to kneel
Dusty O Dusty, this is your night
You'll be so pretty, all laced in white
All laced up in white

My darling you look lovely
I've come to lay you down
Uncover your head and submit to me
We'll make a joyful sound
I don't care if you're by yourself
Or you're all alone when you need my help
Keep that smile on your pretty face
'Cause you don't have much I can't take away
Don't you worry baby, you won't feel a thing
Close your eyes, Holy Roller Novocaine
(Chorus) Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
You'll be hearin' me comin'
But I can't come inside
I'll be out back in my white Cadillac
Won't you join me for a ride
We'll go up to the mountain top
Yeah I'll show all the goods I got
Don't look back keep your eyes ahead
This could be the night that the moon goes red
All the world is moaning and baby so am I
I'm just givin' you warning and I ain't telling you why
All the world is moaning and baby so am I
I'm just givin' you warning and I ain't telling you why

Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
Ruth B. draws we're fixin' to get high
Maybe we'll hit the bluffs and find ourselves the same old rum
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
The knocked up girls, well they've all got their share
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town's gone pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky

Slow night, so long, she's frenching out the flavour
She's 17, but I done went and plum forgot it
No tears are gone, they're pooling on the table
No tears are gone, they're leaving their mark behind
So far so good, she's absolutely wasted
She's hanging up and changing her story around
I just don't know where leading ladies come from
I just don't know where they can be found
She's opened up just like she really knows me
I hate her face but enjoy the company
I'll take you home or back to Oklahoma
You're not so nice but sex sells so cheap
Rise and shine, all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine, all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine, all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine, all you gold-digging mothers

He's so the purity, a shaving and a mourning
And standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray
Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor
Ah, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Good time to roll on

Aha, shake
Taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha, shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha, shake
Black as night on a summer day
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Heartbreak
Knockin' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak
Cigarettes and songs with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak
Keep like my daughter and a run away
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Aha, shake
Tapered jean girl kills me
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher

Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Shatter the frame
Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One and the same
Aiyah
Where did you want to take me?
Aiyah
Where did you want to go?
Aiyah
Wrapping up the morning's coming
Aiyah
Home before the rooster crows
I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's gonna tickle
You're gonna giggle
It's gonna tickle
Tickle for free
Aiyah
Where did you want to take me?
Aiyah
Where did you want to go?
Aiyah
Wrapping up the morning's coming
Aiyah
Home before the rooster crows

Salty leave
Salty leave
Tell me the one about the friend you knew and the last good night that we toasted too
Salty leave
Stay for me
Stay for me
We drank wine in the matinee and the spotlight showed what I chased away
Stay for me
She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush, she'll bartend your party
Kill me
Kill me
I called and I called, but I can't get through, said he's on his own, but his own is you
Kill me
She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush, she'll bartend your party

Wooh
I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
Three in the morning come a-bang, bang, bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait
Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
'Less you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two
Eighteen
Balding star
Golden
Fallen heart
Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk, your Japanese scream
It's been too long since I left the shed
You kick the bucket and I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die, but old is a grave
Eighteen
Balding star
Golden
Fallen heart
I'm a-gonna show the way
I'm a-gonna show the way
I'm a-gonna show the way
I'm a-gonna show the way
Eighteen
Balding star

I used to see you every day
I used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul
I left you with your nose a bleedin'
And your toes creepin' around
Ah, so mundane and incomplete
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
So soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party
But I'm soft
Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes
And in your nose, blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
You let your perfect nipple show
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
So soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party
But I'm soft
But I'm soft
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off, I'm so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come all over your party, but I'm soft

Just like the girlies back at corner stone
Wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
Sweet mutilations of a sold to nothing man
Lord, have mercy, shake is falling through your hand
Razz the kid
Because you love me, I'm the chosen one
These are the days to not be having no fun
I listen back to what you told me before
Just tell me where to come, I'll knock down the door
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid

Toss me a breath when you hold me down
Hot like a razor on my face
Something's growing that don't help me now
Paging the doctor, just in case
Low and behold things are killing me
Silly expectation of a dream
Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair
Boys are gonna hate the way I seem
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Peach Christmas lights spitting German ling
Feels like a fast or homeless sleep
At least there's a record that I love to play
Dreaming about a place I'll never see
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Betty, Betty, Annie is a praying
Baby, with a man like a lung
Smell her crying fighting back a fever
Mad as hell give up
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old, day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues

Huffman don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red man's fire in his eyes
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cockfight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?
This party's overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's a lovin' on the boy from the city
I'll be loving him under my shoe
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cockfight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cockfight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?

Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Start in on your story and I'll go, oh
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Glowing 'cause you're sweating on our floor
Glowing 'cause you're sweating on our floor
Dancing like you'll never dance no more, oh
Glowing 'cause you're sweating on our floor
And then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cause she's a coming to fight
And then she'll go
Death row smoking getting to your face
Death row smoking getting to your face
Showing off your something shaved and lacy
Death row smoking getting to your face
And then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cause she's a coming to fight
And then she'll go
And then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cause she's a coming to fight
And then she'll go
Little Jo, she warned me not to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city where you came from

On the plane, on the plane
Off to see the city girls again
Only bringing what to carry on
So that you know I won't be long
Dripping beards as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail
Honestly, I can see
The giggling virgin overlooking me
Time to put together what they say
Although it wouldn't matter anyway
Dripping beards as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail
This rememo is set for home
It's personal, but they need to know
I'm overdue another round
To gain control and take me down
You're all tied up as you should be
And I'll be cutting out naturally
Dripping beards as cold as jail
And the motherfuckers gonna go to hell
This rememo is set for home
It's personal, but they need to know

I don't care what nobody says, we're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville, she's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says, no, she's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take 'cause taking's gonna shape me
People call us renegades 'cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town because people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other
And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
People call us renegades 'cause we like living crazy
We like taking on this town 'cause people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no, I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other
And her daddy seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna
People call us renegades
We like taking on this town
I don't care what nobody says, we're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville, she's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says, no, she's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take 'cause taking's gonna shape me

Wow, she's such a charmer, oh no
Wow, she's such a charmer, oh no
Why, she's always looking at me
Why, she's always looking at me
Wow, she's such a charmer, oh no
Oh no
Wow, she stole my karma, oh no
Sold it to the farmer, oh no
Why, she's always looking at me

Born in West Virginia, oh no
Married to the preacher, oh no

Oh no

She said call me now, baby, and I'd come a running
She said call me now, baby, and I'd come a running
If you'd call me now, baby, I'd come a running
I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord, you know I'll be there waiting
To be there
To be there
I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord, you know I'll be there waiting
I'm gonna brawl, so be there
One for all, we'll be there
And when they fall to pieces
Lord, you know I'll be there laughing
I'd come a running

I'd come a running
To be there
To be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there

My cold, cold sailor heart says, "Get on your way"
I ain't too proud to say that that's how I'm made
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change
From runways to the road, I ramble alone
This thumbnail size of heart is black as coal
Your beauty, it still bring me to my knees
Don't waste a tear on me, it's my disease
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Those preppy boys in blue, they're making fun of us
So we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery curse
But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to cover ground with a tumbleweed
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't take these boots off me when you think that I'm dead
I'll still be running from the demon in my head
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

It's raining on Old Yeller and it's carving a path
So now we're on our way
It's taking us on journeys where we wipe away frowns
Amongst a crowded place
So why you never call me, no, you never seem to call me
Now that I'm OK
I'll beat you in the end and every time you turn around
Here will come the coming of age
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
My cocky look emerges when you question my moves
'Cause you ain't got no taste
You're talking 'bout my baby, I could flip you upside down
And I could mop this place
Said, why you never saw me, no, you never seen my calling
Right in front your face
I'll smoke you in the end and don't you ever turn around
'Cause here's that coming of age
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party

Why be lonely
Why be blue
You've got me babe
I've got you
And I can't stop thinkin' about you
How I dig rockin' around with you
I was waiting
You came through
You know no one
Else who'll do
And I can't stop thinkin' about you
How I dig rockin' around with you
You know I dig rockin' around
You know I dig rockin' around
You know I dig rockin' around

It's alright if you love me
It's alright if you don't
I'm not afraid of you running away honey
I get the feeling you won't
There is no sense in pretending
Your eyes give you away
Something inside you is feeling like I do
We said all there is to say
Baby
Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me
Breakdown, honey take me through the night
Breakdown, now I'm standing here can't you see
Breakdown, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me
Breakdown, honey take me through the night
Breakdown, now I'm standing here can't you see
Breakdown, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

Baby can't wait baby gotta go 
Gotta do a number on a late night show 
Do a little song do a little dance 
Gonna make the best of her big chance 
It don't really matter if she don't or if she do 
She's tryin' to make the best of the hometown Blues blues 
I gotta friend gotta a little girl 
Say she's the best in the whole wide world 
Said it's so good said it's so real 
Might not last but it's no big deal 
It don't really matter if she don't or if she do 
She's tryin' to make the best of the hometown Blues blues 
Baby save me save me 
Save me your sweet smile 
Honey I really need you 
To help me kill a little bit of time 
All of the girls run with the crowd 
They go wild when the lights go down 
The gotta little money little in a dream 
Wanna be the queen of their little scene 
Don't really matter if she don't or if she do 
She's tryin' to make the best of the hometown Blues blues 
Blues blues blues blues

Well the moon sank, as the wind blew.
And the street lights slowly died.
Yeah, they call you the wild one, said stay 'way from her.
Said she couldn't love no one if she tried.
But then somethin' I saw in your eyes 
Told me right away that you were gonna hafta be mine, honey.
Well and the strangest feelin' came over me, down inside.
No matter what it takes I'll never get over, how good it felt, 
When you finally held me, I will never regret.
Those few hours, linger on in my head,
Forever.
Well it's too bad, but I want you,
To know I understand.
Yeah it's been a long time, but I don't mind,
Yeah it's alright, I understand.
Because somethin' I saw in your eyes,
Told me right away that you were gonna hafta be mine.
Honey, the strangest feelin' came over me, down inside.
I knew right away I'd never get over, how good it felt,
When you finally kissed me, I will never regret.
Those few hours linger on in my head, 
Forever.

Well it was dark at midnight 
There was hardly any moon 
And no one really saw much 
No one was really sure 
But something didn't seem right 
Something was kinda queer 
A roar turned into whispers 
Everyone stood there 
As the sound split the ngiht 
They ran hiding from the light 
Like strangers in the night 
Like strangers in the night 
Well I didn't see no shotgun 
I didn't see no knife 
But I saw this crazy black guy 
With the demon in his eye 
And I heard him say "white man" 
I've seen that silver cue 
You don't remember me well 
But I remember you 
As the sound split the night 
They ran hiding from the light 
Like strangers in the night 
Like strangers in the night 
Well the knife just left his fingers 
As the black guy took his aim 
White guy's head exploded 
The black gut howled in pain 
Then everybody scattered 
I heard some woman scream 
God damn you old black bastard 
You've blown away my dreams 
As the sound split the night 
They ran hiding from the light 
Like strangers in the night 
Like strangers in the night

Strange voice on the telephone 
Tellin' me I better leave you 'lone 
Why don't somebody say what's going on 
Uh oh, I think I been through this before 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
I don't like it 
I don't like it 
You never said you had no number two 
I need to know about it if you do 
If two is one I might as well be three 
It's good to see you think so much of me 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
I don't like it 
I don't like it 
Look out! 
You never said you had no number two

White light cut a scar in the sky 
Thin line of silver 
The night was all clouded with dreams 
Wind made me shiver 
Black and yellow pools of light 
Outside my window 
Luna come to me tonight 
I am a prisoner 
Luna glide down from the moon 
The clouds are all silver and black 
Floating around me 
Luna come into my eyes 
Luna surround me 
With black and yellow pools of light 
Fall by my window 
Luna come to me tonight 
I am a prisoner 
Luna glide down from the moon 
The clouds are all silver and black 
Floating around me 
Luna come into my eyes 
Luna surround me 
With black and yellow pools of light 
Fall by my window 
Luna come to me tonight 
I am a prisoner 
Luna glide down from the moon

Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that
There was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
Yeah, and if she had to die
Tryin', she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (make it last all night)
She was an American girl
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on the balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like
Waves crashing on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach
Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (make it last all night)
She was an American girl

This might sound strange, might seem dumb
Depends on the side that you take it in from
Depends on the time, depends on the day
Depends on a lot of things, who can say
I just want to let you know that I will stand by you
Through whatever might come, wherever you run
Will you stand by me when the time comes
Baby do you understand, am I making this clear
Are you tuning me out 'cause I'm coming off weird
Well I don't care that's all right
That's okay, I don't mind
I just want to let you know that I will stand by you
Through whatever might come, wherever you run
Will you stand by me when the time comes
This ain't the right time to say what's on my mind
I know, but I look in your eyes
And there is no real life at all
Baby hold on
And someday soon you'll come around
You know where I can be found
When you heart feels right, seek me out
We can talk more then babe, but right now
I just want to let you know that I will stand by you
Through whatever might come, wherever you run
Will you stand by me when the time comes

I don't want you, no more
Ain't gonna give any more than you give to me
I don't want you; it's too hard
Can't try any harder than you try for me
You're gonna get it babe
I should've quit it babe
But you look so good
Yeah you do, you do
To think that something might change
But I was just a fool
Go
Go to somebody else like you do to me
I don't want you; can't crawl
I can't crawl any further
You never crawled for me
You're gonna get it babe
I should've quit it babe
But you look so good
Yeah you do, you do
To think that something might change
But I was just a fool
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
Baby you're gonna get it

I walked to the window
Turned out the light
Looked at the city
Went back through the night
Yeah, I stood in the darkness
Stood all alone
Thank God for California
Thank God I'm going home
That's right, you hurt me baby
Hurt me good
Hurt me like no one else ever could
Cut me down the middle
Face down in the dirt
And we both know
It's too late to save it
Betcha feel proud about it baby
You taught me how to hurt
That's right
DC-10, 10:45
Halfway to LA, red in the eyes
You might be the devil
Might just be his friend
It don't make no difference
You ain't gettin' me again

From a table across the room
She was signaling me with her eyes
I walked over to be introduced
I said, "Hello", she just smiled
And said, "I know a place
Not too far from here
We could get away for a while"
Yeah, that's when she kissed me
And told me her name
I never did tell her mine
Magnolia
I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia
And I know that she's out there
Somewhere in the world
She's forgotten me but I remember her
Magnolia
Well her lips were as warm
As that wet southern night
Her eyes were as black as the sky
And I wondered aloud
Just what I had done right
As I lay there, with her by my side
Then she took hold of my hand
As she looked up at me
And said, "Now I must tell you goodbye"
And there in the moonlight
As I watched her leave
I felt a chill down inside
Oh, Magnolia
I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia
And I know that she's out there
Somewhere in the world
She's forgotten me but I remember her
Magnolia
I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia

Looks like you got a little more to lose
Now little more at stake
I see you had a hard time
Livin' with the change
You got me on the line
Now tryin' to call your bluff
But you just won't be satisfied
Too much ain't enough
It ain't enough, it ain't enough
Yeah, you're standing by the telephone
Waiting for the word
And ever since that bathroom scene
There's been a slight concern
I'm tryin' to make this easy baby
You seem to like things rough
You just can't be satisfied

Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Come on baby I'm down on my knees
Guess some little pill just can't be pleased
Little miss queen of hearts you are a strange thing
Why you wanna make so vague
I'm wanderin' through this mess you made
To see what I can save
I'm livin' on the line now
Tryin' to call your bluff
But you just won't be satisfied
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough

Well, the talk on the street says you might go solo
Good friend of mine saw you leavin' by your back door
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long
I can hold on
If you're makin' me wait
If you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Who would-a thought that you'd fall for his line?
All of a sudden it's me on the outside
I need to know (I need to know)
Need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long
I can hold on
If you're makin' me wait
If you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Wow, wow!
Baby, I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long
I can hold on
If you're makin' me wait
If you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Baby, I need to know

You think you're gonna take her away
With your money and your cocaine
You keep thinkin' that her mind is gonna change
But I know everything is okay
She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of lovin'
But she don't need you
You want me to think that I'm being used
You want her to think it's over
You can't see it doesn't matter what you do
Buddy, you don't even know her
She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of lovin'
But she don't need you
And you just can't creep up behind her
And you can't understand that she's my girl
She's my girl
Yeah, she's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of lovin'
But she don't need you

She threw down her golden band
Crushed it with her feet into the sand
Took her silent partner by the hand
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Somewhere near the edge of town
She said she was torn and turned around
Can you help me cast this evil down
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
We'll drive for the line now
There's nothing to be lost
You and I will cross over
With no second thoughts
Yeah, we'll drive for the line now
There's nothing to be lost
You and I will cross over
With no second thoughts
Dreams fade, hope dies hard
She cups her eyes and
Looks out at the stars
Says, "I feel we've traveled very far"
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

I don't need to belong to no one
I don't belong at all
Got my face in the corner
Got my back to the wall
And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too
I'm a hair trigger lover
And I can't face up to nothing
I'm impatient with the wind
But I'm waiting here for something
Pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless restless
You look restless too
Restless sleep, twisted dreams
Moving targets, silent screams
Restless city, restless streets
Restless you, restless me
I'm a face out the window
I'm a black satin sheet
And I can't stay warm
I stay out in the street
And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it
Listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
You believe what you want to believe
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
And revel in your abandon
Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Now baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You gotta feel to be true
Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom
Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Baby you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

You know sometimes, I don't know why
But this old town just seems so hopeless
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus
But when she puts her arms around me
I can somehow rise above it
Yeah, man when I got that little girl standin' right by my side
You know, I can tell the whole wide world shove it, hey!
Here comes my girl, here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right, she is all I need tonight
Every now and then I get down to the end of the day
And I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard
And nothin' ever really seems to come from it
And then she looks me in the eye and says, 
"We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it - hey!
Here comes my girl, here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right, she is all I need tonight (Watch her walk)
Every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
I find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering, waiting, worrying
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'
And then she looks me in the eye and says,
"We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it - hey!
Here comes my girl, here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right, she is all I need tonight

Well, it was nearly summer, we sat on your roof
Yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon
And I showed you stars you never could see
Babe, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me
Baby, time meant nothing, anything seemed real
Yeah, you could kiss like fire and you made me feel
Like every word you said was meant to be
No, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes
Two cars parked on the overpass
Rocks hit the water like broken glass
I shoulda known right then it was too good to last
God, it's such a drag when you live in the past
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
Yeah, they get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes

There goes my baby, there goes my only one. 
I think she loves me, but she don't wanna let on. 
Yeah, she likes to keep me guessin', 
She's got me on the fence with that little bit of mystery, 
She's a complex kid and she's always been so hard to figure out. 
Yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt. 
Sometimes at night I wait around 'til she gets off. 
She don't like workin', she says she hates her boss, 
But she's got me askin' questions, she's got me on the fence
With that little certain something, she's a complex kid, 
And she's always been so hard to get around. 
Yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt. 
Just a shadow of a doubt, she says it keeps me runnin'. 
I'm trying to figure out if she's leadin' up to something
And when she's dreamin', sometimes she sings in French, 
But in the morning, she don't remember it. 
But she's got me thinking 'bout it, 
Yeah, she's got me on the fence
With that little bit of mystery, she's a complex kid, 
And she's always been so hard to live without. 
Yeah, she always likes to leave me, with a shadow of a doubt.

Sometimes I wanna leave you
Sometimes I wanna go
Right back where I came from
Back where I belong
But it never lasts for too long
Always goes away
Well I still don't look for reasons
That's much too hard these days
Why worry about the rain
Why worry about the problem
Honey, Century City's
Got everything covered
Well your mama gave you lovin'
Mama held you near
Baby mama can't do nothin'
Honey mama just ain't here
And you can pretend all you want to
But that won't work no more
No you can't run back to daddy
Yeah you tried that once before
Why worry about your father
Why worry about your mother
Honey Century City's
Got everything covered
We're gonna live in Century City
Go ahead and give in, Century City
Like modern men, modern girls
We're gonna live in the modern world
We're gonna live in Century City
Go ahead and give in, Century City
Like modern men, modern girls
We're gonna live in the modern world
Sometimes I get discouraged
Sometimes I feel so down
Sometimes I get so worried
But I don't know what about
But it works out in the long run
Always goes away
And I've come now to accept it
It's a re-occurring phase
Don't worry about the rain
Don't worry about the problem
Honey, Century City's
Got everything covered
We're gonna live in Century City
We're gonna live in Century City
We're gonna live in Century City
We're gonna live in Century City

I was talkin' with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so, then
Turned around and let him go
Then he said, "You'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size"
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I'll need ya, baby
Don't do me like that
Listen, honey, can you see
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in a public eye
Givin' someone else a try
And you know you'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I need you, baby
Don't do me like that
'Cause somewhere deep down inside, someone is sayin'
"Love doesn't last that long"
I have the feeling inside, night and day
And I can't take it no more
Listen, honey, can you see
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in a public eye
Givin' someone else a try
And you know you'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
I just might need you, honey
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby, oh, oh, oh

Baby, I heard thunder
I woke up, middle of the night
Baby I saw fire
I went left, I went right
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over honey 
It ain't through
Let me know
When you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me
Baby, I don't understand this
But that's alright 
I can take a little pain
I've been winnin' and losin'
Baby, I've been in and out of the rain
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over honey 
It ain't through
Let me know
When you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me
Well you put me through
Your paces and your twists
Until I felt like dying
Yeah, the last thing that I needed
Was to finally realize 
That you were lying
So you tell me what you want me to do
This might be over honey 
It ain't through
Let me know
When you're finished with me
What you want me to be
Baby, you tell me
Honey, you tell me
Baby, you tell me
Will you tell me

Well it was out in California by the San Diego sea
That was when I was taken in and it left its mark on me
Yeah she nearly drove me crazy with all those China toys
And I know she really didn't mean a thing to any of those sailor boys
Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
Baby I'm noticing the change as I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
South Carolina put out its arms for me
Right up until everything went black somewhere on Lonely Street
And I still can't quite remember who helped me to my feet
Thank God for a love that followed the angel's remedy
Louisiana rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face, washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
Well I never will get over this English refugee
Singing to the jukebox in some all-night beanery
Yeah he was eating pills like candy and chasing them with tea
You should have seen him lick his lips, that old black muddied beak
Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
Baby I'm noticing the change as I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge
Louisiana rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face, washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge

Oh baby, don't it feel like heaven right now
Don't it feel like something from a dream
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again
Baby, we know better than to try and pretend
Honey, no one could've ever told me 'bout this
I said yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Well yeah, I might have chased a couple women around
All it ever got me was down
Yeah, then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I feel right now
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now
I said yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Oh, don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you
Don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool
Don't let this go too far, don't let it get to you
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Yeah, the waiting is the hardest part
Whoa, it's the hardest part
Whoa, it's the hardest part

Moving to the beat
Just movin' and groovin'
Killed me when I saw
The wet patch on your seat
Was it Coca-Cola?
Oh baby I hope you liked the show
When the band said goodnight
I had to say hello
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Well I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sitting with a handful of flowers
Looking as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh, I thought I got to be dreaming
I didn't know I fell in her trap
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
She took my heart
She was a soul stripper, ooh
And tore me apart
She started moving nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killing off each last little feeling
Ooh, everyone she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say, you know
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
Ooh, she took my heart
Ooh, was a soul stripper
Tore me apart
Soul stripper, soul stripper
You're a soul stripper
(Oh yes you are)
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper
Took out my heart
And tore it apart
Aah, you're a soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper

My Daddy was workin' nine to five

By the time I was half alive

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer

But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a royal flush

From the bottom of the pack

Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
Oh I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling and being real fine
That's when I say
Can I sit next to you, girl?
Intermission we were doing alright
Till this guy came up and stood by her side
Oh I took him by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling and being real fine
And that's when I say
Can I sit next to you, girl?

C'mon ...
Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical math
You studyin' hard and you're hopin' to pass
Ooh you're working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen is ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you got time to eat
Well back in the classroom open your books
Ooh the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roll
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, hail hail rock 'n' roooooll
As soon as 3 o'clock goes around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books and outta your seat
You go down the hallway into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been
You find a juke joint, you go in
You drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot, like me
With the one you love you're makin' romance

Moving to the beat
Just movin' and groovin'

Was it Coca-Cola?
Oh baby I hope you liked the show
When the band said goodnight
I had to say hello
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Well I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sitting with a handful of flowers
Looking as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh, I thought I got to be dreaming
I didn't know I fell in her trap
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
She took my heart
She was a soul stripper, ooh
And tore me apart
She started moving nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killing off each last little feeling
Ooh, everyone she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say, you know
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
Ooh, she took my heart
Ooh, was a soul stripper
Tore me apart
Soul stripper, soul stripper
You're a soul stripper
(Oh yes you are)
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper
Took out my heart
And tore it apart
Aah, you're a soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper

You can roll me if I'm blind
You can roll me tally ho ho

Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty -
Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you got the dollar, we got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeah boogie
I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million
And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a Momma whose a hummer (and I've gota mama, whose a hummer)
Whose keeping me alive ((just) keepin' me alive)
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys (while I'mdoin' drinkin'
She's working 9 to 5 (with the boys)
(She) knows her place that woman
Just you wait -
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
"Hey hello Howard, how you doin', my next door neighbour?"
"Oh yeah... Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport"

Dead or alive, I got a .45
And I never miss

Problem child

Just feel like running wild
Every night, street light
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win they lose
What I need I like, what I don't I fight

Your time is through
'Cause I'm a problem child

Never been balled before

Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I'm gonna learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 
Climb into my machine so we can groove on out 
I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout 
It's not too far back on the highway not so long a ride 
You park the car out in the open you can walk inside 
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am 
'Cause every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed 
Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I'm gonna learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 
Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing 
Hold tight, bang your foot don't let it carry you away 
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud 
Won't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd 
Well you can't dance I know you would you could 
I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good 
Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I'm gonna learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 
Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away

Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now, yeah
Well, I used to wake the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried, she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Yeah

Take off
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
"Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day"
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shop in an alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you "Be a superstar"
But I tell you just be satisfied, stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started
Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive, shake
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Do you think you're better every day
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, come on, come on

Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There ain't time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got to hide away
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right

Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right

Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said, "you're gonna realise tomorrow"
No I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you?
Would you like to see?

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lions den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on
My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes
Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide

I have sinned dear Father 
Father I have sinned
Try and help me Father
Won't you let me in? 
Liar

Sire I have stolen 
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should
Liar
Oh ev'rybody deceives me
Liar
Why don't you leave me alone?
Liar I have sailed the seas
Liar from Mars to Mercury
Liar I have drunk the wine
Liar time after time

When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in ev'ryone
Ev'ryone and anyone can see
Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Ooh and it's dark again
Once I could laugh with ev'ryone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively colouring
Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it
Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Ooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again

Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temp'rature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll
Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world's
Gonna know just who you are
Look out
Modern times rock and roll

I want you
To be a woman
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled all round the world
A brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman yeah

And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round Him
The beggars shouted the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down

Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water
Three feet tall so very small I'm no trouble
I bring thunder lightning sun and the rain
For all the people in the land
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All good children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
I woke up on the water just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild and believers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small
Let me take you to the river without a ford
Oh and then one day you realise
You're all the same within his eyes
All I've come to say just like before
They call me mad the swine
I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Ooh
Oh now
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Don't ever fail me
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you save you
Oh now
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
I'll get down on my knees and praise the Lord

A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born
Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son to son
And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son to son
Won't you hear us sing
Our family song?
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear
From father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word that I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side through the years
Till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you
Father to son father to son
Father to son father to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son

So sad her eyes 
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes 
As it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair
Heeding unheard 
Pleading one word
So sad her eyes 
She cannot see
How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words could make
So still I wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends as it began

You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now we both know how
No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...
Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...
When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But some day, one day...
We'll come home

Mama's got a problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh
She washed and fed and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma
And the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh
So listen mothers ev'rywhere
To just one mothers son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets and just remember
It's not so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll chose their new shoes
That's not far to bend
You're ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh

Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on the table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye has to focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah!
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
Ah ah ah ah ah
The ogre men are still inside
The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down
Right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
Keep a look out
The ogre men are coming out
From the two way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south
Ogre men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

He's a fairy feller
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new moon's shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke
Ploughman wagoner will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly dally oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
He's a dirty fellow
What a dirty laddie-oh
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero ah
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)
What a quaere fellow
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Soldier sailor tinker tailor ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on mister feller
Crack it open of you please

There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valleys below,
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender,
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
(Ah ah)
Nevermore, ah
Nevermore

Do you mean it, do you mean it, do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it? 
Why do I follow you, and where do you go?
Ah ah ah...
You've never seen nothing like it
No never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
If the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile
Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file
Take this take that bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil
Black on black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun begun
Make this make that keep making all that noise
Ooh march to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even to the end of his life
He'll bring a little love
Ah ah ah...
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah ah ah...
Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile
Fi fo The Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her I's
La la la...
So forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies
Surrender to the singing of the fireflies
Dance to the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever forever
La la la...

Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea
Funny funny funny oh
Funny how love is the end of the lies when the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
That's what love is, that's what love is
Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running wild feeling free
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea
Funny funny funny oh
From the earth below to the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is, that's what love is
Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry 'cause you're late for tea
Funny funny funny oh
Tomorrow comes tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is that's what love is

Fear me, you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls, you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me, you peers and privy councilors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye
(Sister) I live and lie for you
(Mister) do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you
Belong to you forever (Ever, ever, ah)
Storm the master marathon, I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire and I'll survive
(I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)
And I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
(Then I'll get you)
Begone with you you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea
Oh I do like to stroll along the prom prom prom
Where the brass bands play tiddley om pom pom
I do like to be beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
When I'm down beside the sea I'm beside myself with glee
Beside the seaside
Beside the sea

Well she's gone dear gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
Yes I did - too much
Didn't leave didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)
I guess I'm all to blame oh Lord
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later... right now you) -
Take it
My little dog ain't too hungry no no he just kept on barking
Viciously
Just don't seem the same oh no no
It just don't seem the same (oh see you later)
Now hit it - like that
Coming on strong
Well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do
She said go home
Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been oh Lord
What a fo-ooh-ooh-ool I've been

Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"
"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say ?"
"Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"
O rock of ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O lady moon, shine down a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologise
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays..."

My new purple shoes
Bin' amazin' the people next door
And my rock'n'roll forty fives
Bin' enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy...
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign
He says I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied
Simply with those eyes ooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise
Don't look back don't look back
It's a rip off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey baby you've been had
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm sayin'
If not you'll lie in knee deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried
Don't look back don't look back
It's a rip off
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money make machine
Cross collateralise big time money money
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
Then the last goodbye
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey baby you've been had

I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas an answer for me please
The lily of the valley doesn't know
I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow ev'ry course my kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go
Messenger from seven seas has flown
To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace?
The lily of the valley doesn't know

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda
And Titania, Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam, pow, pow
Stairway scared Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green
The sound surrounds the icy waters under
Lime and limpid green
The sound surrounds the icy waters underground

Lucifer Sam Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain
Jennifer Gentle you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side oh no
That cat's something I can't explain
Lucifer go to sea
Be a hip cat
Be a ship's cat
Somewhere anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain
At night prowling sifting sand
Padding around on the ground
He'll be found
When you're around
That cat's something I can't explain

There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes, the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people
Oh Mother, tell me more
Why'd'you have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of
Scribbly black and everything shines
Across the stream with wooden shoes
Bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders
Climb up higher once upon a time
Wondering and dreaming
The words had different meaning
Yes they did...
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more...

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown, yippee
You can't see me but I can you
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn no fear
You can't hear me but I can you
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion too much
I won't touch you but then I might
Screaming through the starlit skies
Traveling by telephone
Hey ho here we go
Ever so high
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown, yippee
You can't see me but I can you

Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread
Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red
Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spool, June gloom
Why do you go?
And now
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor, kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive, flowers thrive
Realise, realise
Realise

I want to tell you a story
About a little man if I can
A gnome named Grimble Gromble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining dining biding his time
And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my...
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go
And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my ooh my...

The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care
He stood in a field where barley grows
His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate 'cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind
He stood in a field where barley grows

I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things
I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front, it's red and black
I've had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things
I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things
I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river forever and ever
Emily, Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine, washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See-through baby blue
He dug it
Oh Arnold Layne, it's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Now he's caught, a nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it
Oh Arnold Layne, it's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne don't do it again

Oh my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Lay back...
Ooh, don't talk to me
Please, just walk with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail
It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon
Ooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
(Drive me wild)
Please, you know I'm feeling frail
Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know
I'm very very very frail
Oh my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
And fly...

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river forever and ever
Emily, Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
