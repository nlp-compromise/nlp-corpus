The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer.
The wave is coming but I ain't got no fear.
I'm waxing down so that I'll go real fast.
I'm waxing down because it's really a blast.
I'm going surfin cos I don't like your face.
I'm bailing out because I hate the race of rats that run round and round in the maze.
I'm going surfing, I'm going surfing!

You take your car to work, I'll take my board.
And when you're out of fuel, I'm still afloat.

My buddies and their honeys all come along.
They seem invincible as they surf along.
The sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg.
We're going surfing, we're going surfing!

All along the undertow is strengthening it's hold.
I never thought it would come to this, now I can never go home.
