My girl's got a big mouth with which she blabbers a lot.
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not.
And if you see her tell her it's over now.

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else.
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf.
When I'm away she never leaves the house.
I want a girl who laughs for no one else .

My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head.
She looks around and around. You know it makes me sad to see her like that.
Please don't believe her - she says that for anyone.
And if you see her tell her it's over.
