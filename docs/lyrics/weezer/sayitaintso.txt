Somebody's Heine' is crowdin' my icebox.
Somebody's cold one is givin' me chills.
Guess I'll just close my eyes.

Flip on the tele, wrestle with Jimmy.
Something is bubbling behind my back.
The bottle is ready to blow.

Say it ain't so.
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so.
My love is a life taker.

I can't confront you, I never could do.
That which might hurt you, so try and be cool.
When I say this way is a waterslide away from me.
That takes you further every day, so be cool.

Dear Daddy, I write you in spite of years of silence.
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear.
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings.
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
