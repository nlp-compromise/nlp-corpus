I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide, I've got a 12-sided die.
I've got Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler too, waiting there for me.
Yes I do, I do.

I've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group KISS.
I've got Ace Frehley, and I've got Peter Criss waiting there for me.
Yes I do, I do

I've got an electric guitar.
I play my stupid songs.
I write these stupid words, and I love every one waiting there for me.
Yes I do, I do

In the garage, I feel safe.
No one cares about my ways.
In the garage where I belong, no one hears me sing this song.
In the garage.
