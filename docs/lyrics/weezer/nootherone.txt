My girl's a liar, but I'll stand beside her.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

My girl don't see me when she's with my friends.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

No, there is no other one.
I can't have any other one.
Though I would, now I never could with one.

All of the drugs she does scare me real good.
She's got a tattoo and two pet snakes.
Nobody knows me like her.
Nobody knows her like me.
We're all we've got and we don't want to be alone.
