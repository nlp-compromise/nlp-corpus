Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind.
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark and then she is the darkness.
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when the sky is starless.

She rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?
