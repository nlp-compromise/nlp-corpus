Rock on, gold dust woman.
Take your silver spoon.
Dig your grave.

Heartless challenge, pick your path and I'll pray.

Wake up in the morning, see your sunrise loves to go down.
Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud.

Did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

Rock on ancient queen, follow those who pale in your shadow.

Rulers make bad lovers.
You better put your kingdom up for sale.
