I took my love, I took it down, climbed a mountain and I turned around, and I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'til the landslide brought it down.
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you.
But time makes you bolder even children get older, and I'm getting older, too.

I took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.
Oh, the landslide will bring it down.
