The world has turned and left me here.
Just where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.

I just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.
You said you loved it more than ever.

You remain turned away, turning further every day.

I talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.
You laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.

You remain turned away, turning further every day.
