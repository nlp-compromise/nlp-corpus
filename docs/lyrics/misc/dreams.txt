Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom.
Well who am I to keep you down it's only right that you should play the way you feel it.
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness.
Like a heartbeat drives you mad in the stillness of remembering what you had,
and what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost.

Thunder only happens when it's raining.
Players only love you when they're playing.
Say women they will come and they will go.
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know.

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions.
I keep my visions to myself, it's only me.
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness, like a heartbeat, drives you mad in the stillness of remembering, what you had.
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost.
