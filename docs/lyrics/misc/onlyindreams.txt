You can't resist her, she's in your bones.
She is your marrow and your ride home.
You can't avoid her, she's in the air, in between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Only in dreams we see what it means.
Reach out our hands. Hold on to hers.
But when we wake, it's all been erased.
And so it seems, only in dreams.

You walk up to her, ask her to dance.
She says, 'Hey baby I just might take the chance'.
You say, 'It's a good thing that you float in the air, that way there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces.'
