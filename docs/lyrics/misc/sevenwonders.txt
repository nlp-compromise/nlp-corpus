So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.
All the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.
I'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.

So it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.
You touched my hand I played it cool.

So long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.
You touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.
If I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.
If I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.
I'll never live to match the beauty again.
