If you wake up and don't want to smile, if it take just a little while, open your eyes and look at the day.
You'll see things in a different way.

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.
Don't stop, it'll soon be here.
It'll be better than before.
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Why not think about times to come, and not about the things that you've done.
If your life was bad to you, just think what tomorrow will do.

All I want is to see you smile, if it takes just a little while.
I know you don't believe that it's true. I never meant any harm to you.
