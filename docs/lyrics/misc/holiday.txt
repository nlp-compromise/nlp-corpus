Let's go away for a while, you and I, to a strange and distant land, where they speak no word of truth, but we don't understand anyway.

A holiday far away to stay.
Far away, let's go today.
In a heartbeat!

Don't bother to pack your bags or your map, we won't need them where we're going.
We're going where the wind is blowing not knowing where we're gonna stay.

We will write a postcard to our friends and family in free verse.
On the road with Kerouac, sheltered in his Bivouac, on this road we'll never die...
