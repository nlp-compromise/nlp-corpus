Can you hear me calling out your name?
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say.

I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout.
You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out.

Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere.

Something's happening, happening to me.
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly.

C'mon baby we better make a start.
You better make it soon before you break my heart.
