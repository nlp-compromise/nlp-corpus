Loving you isn't the right thing to do.
How can I ever change things that I feel.

If I could, maybe I'd give you my world.
How can I, when you won't take it from me.

You can go your own way.
Go your own way.
You can call it another lonely day.
You can go your own way.

Tell me why everything turned around.
Packing up, shacking up is all you want to do.

If I could, baby I'd give you my world.
Open up, everything's waiting for you.
