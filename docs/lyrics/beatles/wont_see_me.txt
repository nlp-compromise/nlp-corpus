When I call you up your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so act your age,
We have lost the time that was so hard to find,
And I will lose my mind,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.

I don't know why you should want to hide,
But I can't get through my hands are tied,
I won't want to stay I don't have much to say,
But I get turned away.
And you won't see me, you won't see me.

Time after time you refuse to even listen,
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.
Though the days are few they're filled with tears,
And since I lost you it feels like years,
Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone,
I just can't go on,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.
