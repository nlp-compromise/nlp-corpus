DC wins this match more often than not, but I think it's a much closer fight than at first glance.
EDIT: added a few details as to how Wolverine takes out Martian Manhunter
You can already customize formations in Team Management for normal teams, but it would be great in FUT. For example if someone has to use a Position Change CAM&gt;CM for Chemistry reasons in a 4312 they would want that CM to play higher up the pitch, and could accomplish it by customizing formations.
Also to tell if your opponent customized their formation, it would show the exact diagram in another section on the team-viewing screen right before you enter the match.
 Hire me, EA.
As a peasant would say: "It isn't about the graphics."
And while a peasant wouldn't really mean it, I *do*. What about games like fez, braid, or bastion? What about old games like half life or freespace 2? Would you refuse to play those? If you refuse to play games simply because of bad graphics then you are seriously limiting yourself. Games are art, and just like traditional art, there are millions of variations, from abstract to photorealistic. All mediums tell a story though, and the quality of the story is what determines whether or not we like the art. Halo 4's story was amazingly well told.
 OP needs to grow up and stop trying to impress others with his fanboyishness.
Worst date ever would have to be one with a guy I had met in our University's library. Right? You'd think that if the guy had the guts and the charm to come over to me while I'm studying and ask me to dinner, he'd be a keeper. Nope. At least not in this case. 
Told me he'd take me to dinner. Then when he came to pick me up, he said he didn't quite have enough money and maybe could we make dinner back at his place. I am totally fine with this, in fact I think it's a bit romantic. So we start making dinner, drinking wine, all that stuff. But as  soon as we sit down, he's on his computer talking about his Fantasy Football League. Now, I have no problems with that but there is a time and place for everything. Then, he calls up some of his mates and talks for a good 20 minutes about who he should pick and a lot of football jargon that I do not quite understand. (Sorry, never been a big fan of football). All while I'm sitting there just idling time by myself, quietly eating. Then he gets off his computer and has finished his food when he asks me if, since he did the cooking (though we both did) could I do the dishes? Alright this slightly annoys me but I can understand why he'd want me to help out. I'm not trying to be a bitch on the first date. I find the sink already absolutely full of dishes and start on the ones that we used. I finish with just the plates that we used because I figured that's what he meant. So as I start to dry my hands he asks me why I haven't done the rest of them. I, now thoroughly pissed off and annoyed, do ALL the rest of the dishes by hand (no dishwasher) and ask him to take me home. Once we get back to my place he asks if he can come in for a bit, I politely say no, and he gets furious, kicking me out of the car and drives away. Needless to say, I didn't call him again. 
Now I'm fine doing the dishes and helping out and all of that stuff! That's not a big problem but ignoring me as we eat dinner and then asking me to do the dishes on the FIRST date is a bit much I think. 
First date made dinner, spent whole meal fixing his Fantasy Football League and calling up mates, asks me to do all his dishes when done, then gets upset when I don't put out. 
I had seen this guy a couple times, met him through a mutual friend, blahblah. He invited a small group of people over for a party. As guests started leaving one by one, he ended up pulling out some old box of things he had been keeping and showing them to me. A lot of his shit was boring or kind of weird (ex. an empty chip bag from a summer camp ten years prior). I indulged him because I liked making out, okay?
Anyway, he pulls out this envelope and holds it gingerly with a content look on his face. After I prompted him to explain why he was fondly cradling said envelope, he opened it and showed me its contents. Hair. Locks of hair in varying colors. All from his ex girlfriend. Every time she changed her hair style, he would request a lock of her hair and keep it in this creeper envelope.
I couldn't quite keep the expression of disbelief off my face and it prompted him to put the box away. I had convinced myself to forgive him for this eccentricity (he had many--he was literally an artist of the kookiest kind in Portland, OR) mostly because he was hot and I was hoping to get lucky that night. But I was fully aware of how weird it was.
Anyway, we were putting some stuff away from the party and I opened the fridge to put a few sodas away when, in the vegetable crisper, a neon blue liquid catches my eye. I slowly pull the drawer open and see a plastic container with a few fish and a lizard floating in it. I could feel my attraction dying. Just as slowly, I closed the drawer again and turned to put away the ice cream that was still on the counter. When I opened the freezer, I was face to face with a dead bird and, before I could stop myself, I said, "Why the FUCK is there a dead bird in your freezer?"
His response was, "I found it on the side of the road and wanted to do something with it."
I got myself out of that house in under three minutes and, strangely, he never tried calling me again.
**Hot, Portland artist-type guy has ex's hair in an envelope and dead animals in the fridge and freezer.**
This sort of counts. I was 16 and playing wingman for my friend. We met up at the movies and the girl I was suppose to "be with" clearly didn't want to be there. I was trying my best to make her feel comfortable but she wasn't having any of it. We ended up going to the movies and my friends girl demanded we watch what ever she wanted. She chose fucking epic movie. I ended up paying for all 4 tickets. I knew this movie was going to be a piece of shit but they insisted it looked like a good funny movie. They wanted to leave the movie early because it was soo fucking bad and soon after they just left us without really saying good bye.
TLDR went on a double date, mine didn't want to be there. I paid for a shit movie only to have our dates ditch us.
In high school, we went on a date to see The Prince of Egypt, the Val Kilmer Moses cartoon, because why not.
We were the only two people in the theater for the first ten minutes or so until a class of various middle-school aged kids from a religious school walk in and sit in the row directly behind us for some reason. They kicked the back of our seats and threw popcorn at our heads continuously saying "what-are-you-gonna-do-about-it?" There was a teacher but he wasn't saying anything.
Like every responsible adult capable of dealing with their own problems, I told on them to the management of the theater. The usher comes down with a flashlight and asks them to behave or leave, they choose to leave, screaming that we were intolerant and were picking on them. 
Then she puked popcorn in my car on the way home.
I didn't know what to do, so I pulled over and waited for her to finish. 
Because I turned the car off, she thought I was mad at her for puking, so she started to cry and got out of the car to walk home. I had to drive slowly on the road with the door open, beckoning her to get back inside the puke filled car. 
I probably looked insane.
 Fuck you, Val Kilmer
In college a guy who I had only met once and texted a lot asked me out. I had to drive to his apartment because he would not tell me what we were doing or where we were going. My friends told me to keep my phone on me and have their numbers ready to come pick me up if things get weird. 
So when I get to his house, we get in his car and he's still being really vague about what his plans are. After driving a few minutes, he then pulls into a bookstore. He days, "I think going out to eat on a date is so overrated... And I need a book for class." Cool, wish I knew that so I could have already eaten.... Whatever. 
So we're walking aimlessly around the bookstore talking. He's randomly picking up books and asking me about myself. Well, we get to talking about my sorority. He's mocking me about it. How we're all little princesses and buy out friends and are whores. He calls me a little princess for the rest of the night. I'm over this now and ready to go home. 
After he's done at the bookstore, he never buys any book for class, we leave to head back to his apartment. He asks me if I want to come inside and watch a movie with him and his roommates. I decline and tell him I have a lot of homework to catch up on. He tries to go in for the kiss and I let him kiss my cheek. I leave his place and never spoke to him again. 
 Guy asks me on date. Doesn't tell me what we're doing. Takes me to bookstore because "eating out on dates is overrated" and he needs a book for class. Spends time at book store insulting me then takes me back to his place to watch a movie with his roommates and attempts and awkward good bye kiss. He never even bought a book...
Met a girl on craigslist about 5-6 years ago. I was new to the area, so when she told me her address I had no idea I was about to drive into the worst ghetto the state had to offer. When I get there, I text her, but it doesn't go through because she only has a land line. The car in front of me starts blasting its horn before taking off. As soon as he does, she comes out around the corner looking pissed off I was honking. Off to a good start...
I start driving back to my place and this girl does not stop talking the entire time. No problem, a little weird, but at least she was friendly. Honestly, I just wanted to get the hell out of the neighborhood. When we get a few blocks from my place, she leans out the window and yells to some dude at the bus stop. Something like, "look, I'm in a car!" Ok, whatever.
I get her to my place, and we smoke a bit. I offer her ice cream, and she insists on putting the spoon into boiling water. I still don't care because my best move is coming up. I had a studio with a bed in front of the tv... no couch. I suggest we watch a movie and she was game. Picks one, jumps right into bed.
So I go in for the kiss and this girl put her tongue as far down my throat as possible. Seriously, there was tongue everywhere. I would have let that slide, but her arm was above her head, and the BO was overwhelming. Also, at that exact moment, I glanced over and saw a mouse in the center of my apartment. It was the trifecta, and I had enough. It's now 3am and I tell her I will take her home. She obviously wants to stay and gives me the "my mom will be so mad at me coming home this late." Whatever stinky, I need to get you out of here and buy some mouse traps. I trek back to the ghetto and she starts telling me what a nympho she is. For a second I consider getting road head, but at that point I just wanted to call it quits. I drop her home and honestly hope I don't get shot driving out of there.
For the finale to this disaster, I get lost on my way out of the hood and stop at a gas station for directions. I got out of the car, but the store at the station was closed. Being outside the car was a bad idea, but some taxi saw me and took mercy on me and drove over to tell me how to escape. We were pointed opposite directions to talk driver to driver and he points to the highway entrance. I floor it to get out of there... right over a curb.
 picked up a girl on the internet. Unknowingly drove to the ghetto to get her, smoked, made out with her while a mouse watched and got repulsed by her BO. Drove her back to the ghetto without getting off and bottomed out on the ride home.
my first date. I was 14, and we barely even talk. We walked around the town in the dark listening to music on earphones. When we got back to where she lived, she refused to stay, and followed me to my place, so I won't go home alone. 
 my first girlfriend was a gentleman to me.
*ninja grammar edit*
I met this girl online who decided when I went to pick her up she wanted to bring along her two best friends who were constantly making out in the back while I drove two hours to a nightclub (she really wanted to go) that it turned out was shut down then another two hours back towards where I picked her up only for her to decide they wanted to go to a strip club.  It was a full nude nasty strip club, the kind of place I felt I needed to take an acid bath afterward to be clean again.  Her one female friend kept us there until closing in an attempt to pick up one of the strippers and the other male friend spent the entire time lamenting how his girlfriend had dumped him earlier that day.  The girl I was on the date with however spent the entire five hours commenting how the strippers vaginas looked wrong.  I saw nothing wrong with any of them which led me to wonder what her vagina could possibly look like that she thought the others were wrong.
Girl brought along two best friends to nasty strip club; female friend picked up nasty stripper; male friend was depressing; and female date didn't seem to know what a vagina is supposed to look like.
Not too bad in comparison to others on here, but I ended up going out with this one girl for a first date a while back. I didn't really know her, but I thought she was cute and asked her out. She tells me a day later that we should go on a double date with her friends (an established couple) because they can get us into a free movie. I'm fine with that. I like free things.
Day of the date, I go to pick her up at her house. Except I can't pick her up. Her mother INSISTS on driving us to the movie theater. I am still not deterred. Awkward ride over, but whatever. We still talk and kind of get to know each other. We meet her friends at the theater and the movie starts. It takes about 5 minutes of the movie before her friends start making out. And it wasn't just quiet stuff you could ignore. The girl is moaning and the guy is "talking dirty". This goes on for the majority of the movie.
By the end, my date and I were just awkwarded out and didn't say a word to each other. Then to top off the awkwardness, we had to ride back to her house with her mother. We did not go out again.
Went on a double date with girl and her friends. Her friends make out super hardcore the entire time. Then we had to survive further awkwardness getting a ride from her mother.
I was 20, and in college. I'm female. I had met this kid in my ethics class (somewhat pertinent) and he seemed nice. We would talk briefly and he seemed like a fine guy. I worked on-campus at a coffee shop, and when he'd stop by, I'd give him free samples just to be friendly.  
We had exchanged numbers to work on a class project, but he texted me one day to ask if I wanted to come to his dorm room to watch a movie. Since we weren't 21, dorm parties were a regular occurrence and I thought nothing of it. He told me there would be some guys from his hall there and I agreed.
I showed up to his dorm room, there was no one else there - not even his roommate. So this was a date...alright, kind of weird that you told me people would be here, but I'll just roll with it. He turns on Superbad and we watch in silence. Out of nowhere, he says "I'm really good at eating girls out." I was flabbergasted because this came out of nowhere and was pretty awkward. I kind of laughed it off and said something along the lines of "good for you." Silently, we kept watching. I should have listened to my instincts to get the hell out of there, but I felt too awkward.  
Suddenly, he was asking me all these inappropriate sexual questions. "How many people have you had sex with?" I'm not shy, so I gave him the answer, but it took me a minute or so to think. He got all up in my face and said "ew you're dirty, it took you that long to think of all the guys?" (The number was 5, so really not that many). Everything turned into a competition. This next bit was the last straw.  
Still in that competitive mindset, he says, "I bet I've had a harder life than you!" I say, why? Well, fuck me for asking. He pulls out a LARGE knife from his top bedside drawer and tells me his brother held it to his neck when he was a kid. I grabbed my coat and ran the fuck out of there. I got back to my dorm and started banging on my friend's door to let me in. I looked behind me down the hallway and there he was, the kid, following me. My friend finally answered the door and I charged in, slamming the door behind (automatically locking it).  
I drank a lot of vodka that night.  
Trust your instincts when they tell you to get the hell out of the situation.
Back when it wasn't creepy to pick up girls on MySpace (this was about 7 or 8 years ago) I was messaging a girl and we decided to meet up. I meet her at a park and 5 of her other friends were there. As soon as I got there she said she had to go home and do chores but she'd be back. So I hung out at a park with her friends for two hours. One of them was bi and he was hitting on me constantly. She finally showed up again and then we sat on the beach in almost silence for an hour and then I went home. Saw her at a Bass Pro Shop a year later. We locked eyes for what felt like 10 minutes and didn't say a word to one another. Never saw her again. 
 Met a girl on MySpace, she left to go do chores while I hung out with her friends, bi friend hit on me the entire time, bass pro shop forever!!
Okay, so I have one.
There was this girl I thought was really cute in class. I'm not the type to really go out there and get em, so it took a couple weeks for us to start talking more. One day, we stayed after class and were talking and realized we were connected through an extremely specific set of coincidences. one was that we were both only taking that class at that campus, our others were on the main on the other side of town. The other was that my cousin and her sister were in the same graduate program and were really good friends. So I'm here thinking that I have just fallen into a gold mine of a situation. What could be better? 
Fast forward two weeks. I've been slow with her. I didn't want to come on too strong. We have been texting and still seeing each other in class. Finally, I muster the courage to ask her out one day after class, she says yes. Sweeeeeeet!
Fast forward *another* two weeks. Date hasn't happened yet. Still see each other in class. Still text. It had just gotten very stale and boring by this point, but we still kept talking to each other. But the waiting was finally over!
We finally have enough time to see each other.
So for this date that has been seemingly waiting to happen for almost a month, we decide to go to dinner and a movie.
But of course, that didn't happen. She calls beforehand and tells me let's just go to a movie. So I tell her okay and we meet up at the cinema.
Now, at this point, I'm about fed up with this chick. She's been giving me excuses, she was putting me off, and I had already gotten the idea that this wasn't going to go well. But I was already there so fuck it. She decides she wants to see Over 21 or finally 21 or something about kids drinking, typical college tomfoolery. We're both laughing, not really talking. I'm sure to other people it looked more like two friends going out than a date. That's just how much didn't happen.
I would have been okay with that. I would have taken that shit date over what unfolded the rest of the night.
So like I said, we are sitting there just watching the movie.
And then I felt it. It just all happened so fast.
*rrrrppphnnhgg*
Enter ready to explode out of my asshole diarrhea. I hadn't eaten anything that day except a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but it felt like I had this unnatural buildup just compounding itself in my intestines. We had to be only halfway through the movie. And I knew I could not get off my ass. Because if I stood up, the shit rocket would be flowing fast and hard behind me. 
So I sat there, FOR THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF of that stupid movie trying to give nice, disarming smiles so this girl wouldn't think that I am incapable of controlling my bladder. When she would laugh and move her body forward, I would squirm and readjust just to get a little more comfortable. I was letting out small, tiny farts that I prayed to every God ever known didn't smell, because we were not sitting in an area populated with a lot of people, so she would know the source extremely quickly.
So the movie ends. Finally. Great. Get me the fuck out of this fucking cinema so I can clear this now sizable truckload of feces built inside me. It was one of the worst pains ever. And I just had to grin and bear it, just so I wouldn't embarrass myself on this date that I didn't even care about. 
By this point, I have a better handle on it and I'm able to hold it in. I walk her to her car (slowly) and give her a quick hug goodbye. The movie theater was closing (late showing) and I couldn't use their bathroom. So I walked as fast as I could to my car, trying to deal with the sharp pains that had seemingly not gone away for upwards of 2 hours. I drive to the walmart, go immediately to the bathroom, and get sweet, sweet relief. 
It was finally over.
**TL:DR** poop sucks sometimes
Edit: forgot to say that I saw her at a store that commonly sells in bulk recently. She still has no idea that she was the worst date I have ever had.
I was doing some online dating through OkCupid. I had lots of bad/interesting dates, but one in particular takes the cake.  I agreed to meet up with a guy for dinner.  We agree to go to an Indian place near me.  He indicates that he is taking the bus from where he is from to here and asks if we stay out late if I'd be able to give him a ride home.  I didn't think much of it and said sure. So we get to dinner and we start talking about our lives... where exactly do you live, what do you do, etc.  Turns out he is unemployed and lives in his grandma's condo (she splits her time 50/50 here and Florida). I went with it, I understand the job market isn't great or whatever. I am in grad school, so it isn't like I'm not used to making no money (or hardly any). I then find that he's been unemployed for over a year and looks down on people who work in the food industry, which is why he'd never get a job at a restaurant. Okay, whatever.  Somehow the conversation then goes to past relationships, I find out he has only ever been with 1 person.  I'm not against this, but it usually indicates that they hold relationships and sex to a higher level than what I do.  I also find it a little disconcerting since he is 29 (I was 26 at the time), and has only had one relationship (and only had sex with one person). Now, to top everything off, at the end of dinner, he licks the plate.  I can't imagine what my face looked like at that moment; horror, disgust, surprise, get me the hell out of here as fast as possible. I was just amazed that someone had the balls to do that in the restaurant. We split the bill and he asked if he could come back to my place and watch a movie or something. I told him he better make sure to catch the bus home.  He called me several more times to try and have another date, then got mad that I said I was going out with someone else (like I was cheating on him or something). What a mess.
TL/DR: Went to indian with an unemployed plate licker. 
I was on a second date with this girl. We'd met at a rooftop party a few weeks prior. The first date was alright, I'd had fun but it was weird because we quickly had to talk about astrological signs, which I think are barely even fun as entertainment and a very crappy tool for making decisions of any kind. But I'd agreed on a second date because I thought there was some potential there. Little did I know how wrong I was. Anyway, we were going out in Downtown Los Angeles, there is a Whiskey Bar I love down there, So I was taking this girl out. Now I don't like to call Women crazy, because it is unfair and often based on a male's unacceptable behavior towards women. But that chick Cray.
On our first date after mexican food for lunch and a trip to a bookstore, all of which I paid for, because "It's the man's role" (her words) I bought pot from a friend who was her roommate. We smoked, which I didn't really want to do because I had a bad experience on a date previously, but she seemed ok with it so I was fine. She then gets extremely animated and talks about how when she smokes pot she gets all horny and Kinky and she is into Ice Cubes and stuff like that during sex. Now on a first date you would think that would be an exciting thing to hear and you would normally be right. But my date was classically crazy, so this kind of thing did me no good at all. When we walked downtown I was not allowed to walk over certain parts of the street, because I could fall through into the old Subway line that was haunted.  Anyway this is about the second date I had with my stoned out crazy medium, just remember the ghost thing. 
On our second date, I met my future wife outside her building after parking and walking up. We decided (She decided), that we should go up to my car and smoke pot before going out anywhere else. I'm ok with this because I find myself at least interested in making the night not SUCK for me. So we go up to my car and smoke the pot. On the elevator ride down, we get in an elevator that sends us to certain levels instead of the floor we selected. I joke that the thing MUST be haunted. And she very seriously tells me to not joke about that kind of thing because MANY OF THE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN are haunted... Again, I should have stopped it there. We then walk out of the parking structure, and past her building again, where she realized that OOPS! She "Forgot" her wallet up in her apartment. Before she can decide not to go up and get it. I make the point that it was ok, I had planned on paying tonight anyway. I was basically about 50% certain that this would be the last date I go on with this girl. I was 12% certain that I would stop dating women in general as I could save money and stress and go out alone and have a much nicer time. Quick tip: I don't know how most men feel about this, but I genuinely do not have a problem with paying for a date, especially when I'm the one doing the asking. What I and I assume most men would appreciate, is acknowledgement at the generosity, not like quid pro quo, or anything just a general good time having kind of thing would be nice. I mean just smile nice and be fun conversation I feel like that kind of thing makes the evening worthwhile. Why would you agree to go out with someone if it wasn't to have a nice time?
We are on our way to the whiskey bar now, my date lives downtown, I should mention. I should also mention that she knows the entire goddamn population downtown, this includes:Nearly Every Bouncer at places on the way to the bar, people standing on the street with their phones trying to mind their own business, as well as random passersby who happen to look at us for a brief moment that they regret because my date HAS to talk with them about being on a date with me. I'm supposed to be charmed by this I think? Or impressed? instead of annoyed at stopping every 12 feet to have a "conversation" with people who appear to just want to be on their way. But it gets better. We walk into a bakery that is around the corner from the whiskey bar, to visit my date's bestie who works there. "Maybe she has a cigarette I can bum" Yes. my date also OBSESSIVELY SMOKES CIGARETTES, which is only ever attractive on a woman and not disgusting and teeth coloringly gross. So we go in and say hi, I actually met this friend at the rooftop party so we chat a bit I was tempted to buy something because I was a bit peckish, but we were actually on our way before I could. Which is hillarious to me, the one stop we make that I enjoy is the one we leave SOOOOOOOO much faster. Also she didn't get an cigarettes so we'd have to make another stop. I'm not realizing at the time that she did not have enough money for cigarettes. You are thinking, this date sounds amazing how did you not propose marriage in the street? I didn't have time because we were finally at the BAR!
I knew the place well enough and I think its like common date strategy to go somewhere you know so you can look better. looking good would not be a problem for me on this date. My date was still in the throes of nicotine withdrawl, so she's decided to find a smoke while I order us drinks. I think this seems reasonable enough, because I'm trying to be game on this date, against my better judgement. I forgot what I had myself. But I had a thought, a coy clever thought that required a callback to the first date. My date is from the Caribbean, she has family from there and has gone there herself previously (so she claimed). So I found a whiskey that had been aged in a Caribbean Cask. I was going to tease her about it because she was older than me, but you know in a playful way. I also decided to ask for a single ice cube, this was based on mentioning that she was into that sort of thing sexually back during our first date. So I am drinking my drink a bit as she comes back after finding a cig. 
Now, I can't really explain very well the next part of the story without just typing out the dialogue. So...
Me: He welcome back, did you find your cig?
Her: YEAH! and I met these awesome people outside we should go talk to. They are all Pisces and Gemini so we'll get along with them great.
Me: ... that sounds nice. I got you a drink.
Her: Oooooh so what did you get me? I'm interested in what you choose me.
Me:(perks up) Well... I got this 12 year Glen for myself, here taste it (Shares with her), and I got you this Whiskey that is 10 years old and aged in a Caribbean Cask.
Her: Ooooh I'm from there did you know that? (She sips)
Me: OH you are? What a coincidence (wink knowingly) They say it's got a bit of a bite to it.
Her: yeah it does... you have to be careful.
Me: I like bite so I think its pretty good. There's also another thing about it. 
Her: The ice cube?
Me: Yeah I thought you might like that...
Her: Why?(changes tone) BECAUSE I'M AN ICE COLD BITCH?
Me:... uhhh... not exactly what I was thinking...
(End Scene)
After that scene, we had a bit more small talk that she only half listened to and continued to drone on and on about her beliefs and all the connections she's made, then we decided to go outside and see her new friends. It was a group of people out for the night, who just happened to all be Asian. My date, decided to talk about how they were all probably ninjas and/or good at math. I tried to bond with them and avoid the creepy racist undertones the conversation had taken. But my date didn't get the memo. SO they loaned her a cig, which I was worried might have been poison given her comments earlier. But they seemed alright and these people were generally nice and warmly decided to be a fun part of our date night. They did not know that they were the only fun part of our date night. After we left them, we returned to our seats for about 5 minutes tops before my date needed another smoke. I was ready for a snack since my drink was a double(Needed it), so we adjourned to 7-11 for some snacks. 
She was still singly focused on cigarettes.She is in-front of me, with what I assume is enough cash to pay for her own filthy habit. As the total comes up she looks back at me to pay, NOW the date is officially over. I pay for her cigarettes, and my own stuff. and we walk out and I can eat my whiskey absorbing Hot Cheetos outside the bar. I have no plans to go back in, I have no plans to do anything else with this terror of a date, because I'm honestly just sobering up so I can drive home. We're standing outside with all intentions of going back in according to her. I can honestly still salvage the evening with video games and complaining on facebook. So after she's finished and I'm finished too, I tell her I'm probably ready to go back I can't really drink more and drive safely so I'd rather just go home.
So we go back to my car and I drive her out of the parking garage. She got back in my car to beg me for some of the weed I had, now again, I'm not stingy, I'm not a mean person, but I literally want as little as possible to do with this girl. I tell her I'm almost out so I can't share with her this time. So she pouts a bit and says ok, like I fucking owe her something or some shit. and we talk and hold hands while I drive her two blocks to her building. It was actually one block but it felt like two. We go past where we went on the first date and she day dreams about the two of us hanging out more, like it will actually happen. I play her some music that I like to drive to while we sit in front of her building. She is looking at me like we're going to kiss, I am completely against it. I am parked and completely shutting down anything else because this night is OVER. She smiles at me with a tobacco stained grin and she says our paths are crossed forever. She gets out of the car and I drive home. WORST. DATE. EVER.
** I went on the date from hell with a terrible person and I learned I'm a great date that should not date actual crazy people.**
I met the girl at a house part my room mates threw.  We danced and hit it off, so we exchanged numbers.  A week later, we made plans to meet up for dinner, or so I thought, at a sandwich shop on campus.  She's over an hour late because church (she lived in the catholic dorm on campus), but she still wants to meet up.  Anyway, she finally gets there, and I'm hungry because it's like 8 o'clock and I haven't eaten since lunch.  So, I order a sandwich; she orders nothing.  So, now I'm feeling all awkward for eating and she didn't even get a drink.  There was no second date.
- date shows up over an hour late to a dinner date where she doesn't eat.
Few years ago I used to internship at a law firm. I would go to court with different attorneys twice a week.
One day I was in the traffic court division. I see this girl sitting behind me and I start flirting with her in one of the breaks. We hit it off, I get her phone number, we start talking.
She tells me she had never been to the zoo so I tell her let's go to the zoo. Why not? I pick her up. She asks me to stop at a gas station to buy some cigarettes (ok strike one) and starts smoking in my car (strike two, but there pale in comparison to three).
So anyways we get to the zoo, start walking around, make fun of the animals, whatever. We're having lunch and I ask her so why were you at court. Was it some bullshit traffic ticket? She told me no she was just early for her bail hearing so she was making time and just randomly went inside another courtroom.
I ask her bail hearing? She tells me yes she's currently out on bail. So I make the stupid question of asking her for what. She said she rather not say. Now I go to the bathroom to investigate on my phone. I had the app that had reverse phone number lookup even for cell phones. Look up her phone number, I get her full name. I go on the clerk of courts website and look her up.
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER
So I seriously used my newfound knowledge to kind of ask what it was. I tell her I won't judge her or anything, but if she wants this to work, honesty is a good start. I jokingly tell her I don't want to know you're involved in organized crime or anything. She eventually tells me the truth. Her boyfriend tried beating her and she accidentally killed him. Broke down in tears telling me.
So whatever, end of date. She actually called and texted me again after that but I figured you're probably going to prison for a while soon, so what's the point in pursuing this?
 went on a date with a murderer.
It started with some odd Facebook statuses.  There was a sort of quiet, weird guy at my university, and I noticed that whenever I had just left a room he was in, his Facebook status would update to something like "I wish I could have had the courage... maybe next time."  Eventually I start to wonder if these are about me, but I tell myself to stop being so conceited and forget about it.
Anyways, shortly after, this guy asks me out.  Turns out they were ALL about me.  Well, he does seem sort of sweet, and he thinks I'm really cute and all, so I figure I should at least give him a chance, even though he's not very attractive, and he had the same name as my dead brother, which was a little awkward.
So, over spring break, he drives to my house and picks me up, and we spend some time walking around the town square.  Conversation is a bit slow and awkward, but I'm very introverted so I sort of expected that to happen and try to get through it.  Afterwards, he comes back to my house (Note: my parents house that I'm visiting over Spring break) and asks if he can show me some Dr. Who episodes.  I'm not particularly into Dr. Who myself, but whatever, I'll humor him.  So we watch one episode... then two... then he wants to watch a third.  And I just want him to leave.  Dude didn't know when to end the date.  Finally, I get him to leave.
After that, he apparently decided we were in a relationship.  He kept showing up in my dorm building to hang out in the lounge, and would follow me around quietly.  I would move to a different conversation, and five minutes later he'd wander over and stand silently in that group.  This really killed my efforts trying to flirt with a really hot guy who lived down the hall from me.
Eventually, I had to actually "break up" with this guy, even though we were never in a relationship.  And he spent the next several days texting me about how sad he was about it, and using me as a person to talk to about it because he didn't have anyone else to confide in and moan about the "breakup" to.
Anyways, now I'm dating that hot guy from down the hall, and it's pretty great.  He and his roommate still like to crack jokes about that other guy doing creepy things.
*** Quiet creepy guy keeps posting vague Facebook statuses about wanting to date me, then thinks we're in a relationship after one date.  Had to "break up" with him to get him to stop bothering me.
Very first "real" date. I was 19, and he was a classmate who'd been hounding me for a date since class started. I knew it was going to go badly within seconds of showing up.
We'd agreed that I would drive to his apartment, and he would drive us to a by-the-slice pizza place and then see Daredevil (should have known it would be bad in the planning phase, I KNOW). I arrive half an hour before we have to leave and he lets me in with a grunted, "Hi," before returning to his computer chair. He has NO THINGS. There is a computer with a desk and chair, and a lawn chair in his otherwise empty apartment. I try to strike up some conversation, but he's at his desk, furiously typing and has no interest in speaking to me. "What are you playing?" I ask. "Dark Age of Camelot." "So, you wanna take off?" I try. He tells me he can't leave early because he needs to meet a friend and sell him a fake sword for fake money. I sigh and sit down in the lawn chair. I keep trying to talk to him, but he's uninterested.
The time to leave rolls around (let's say it's 4:00 pm for clarity's sake), and I get up and tell him it's time to get rolling. He tells me his friend hasn't logged in yet. "So, he's late. Let's go." "You don't play MMOs. You don't understand. I have a reputation in this game. I can't just stand this guy up." "He's not there. Let's go." "We can push it back another half hour. It's fine." No matter what I say, he won't get up, and he lapses back into typing and ignoring me.
4:30 I tell him the time. I am bored and starving. He won't move. Says we'll catch the last showing of Daredevil at 7:30, and that will give us another TWO HOURS TO WAIT IN HIS EMPTY APARTMENT.
6:30 He hasn't spoken with me except to grunt when I try and spark conversation. He still refuses to move since his friend hasn't logged in. He suggests we skip dinner and just go to the 7:30 showing. I protest, but he just insists I don't understand how important this is, and continues ignoring me.
7:15 It is now time to leave to watch a bad movie while starving. He's rooted in place. I've been here since 3:30. I tell him it's his friend's fault if he doesn't get this sword, and it is time to leave. My date continues protesting. I suggested he call the guy and tell him to log in so we can leave. He doesn't have his number. E-mail him. Doesn't have his e-mail. Turns out he has no way to contact him, because not only is this guy not an actual friend, *but he doesn't even know his toon name and was supposed to have met him AT NOON through a mutual friend WHO IS ALSO NOT ON.* He insists he needs a few more minutes to see if he turns up, or his magic sword selling reputation *may never recover.* I tell him I'm leaving to go get Taco Bell. He starts placing an order. I clarify that I am taking my horrible food back to *my* apartment, and he would have to find his own food, *good day, sir.*
**TL/DR** Got stood up by a date while at his apartment speaking to him.
This will probably be buried but I shall tell it anyway. 
So it'd been well over a year since I'd had any action whatsoever. All my friends are couples, and while they do a great job of not making me feel excluded sometimes you still just inherently feel left out. So we all went to this anime convention in town and we all set goals to make sure we had a good time and didn't just wander around saying "I donno what do you wanna do??" 
I had two goals: get the signature of one of the special guests, and get laid. They all agreed that the familiar and chill environment would be the perfect place for me to step out of my shell and get out there again. 
We are hanging out in a courtyard getting some fresh air and this dude comes up and starts talking to us. He is really cute and asks me if my friend has a boyfriend, she does, asks if my other friend has a boyfriend,  she does, finally asks if I do, I don't so he starts flirting with me. 
That was sign #1
We leave to go catch a panel, I say see ya and nothing more. I should mention that all my friends are cosplaying various pokemon so in an effort to make me feel included they make me a name badge with "cool trainer ferociousshecreature" and I am their "trainer".  So on our way to the panel I think to myself "ah fuck it I will give him my number..." I quickly scribble 'cool trainer ferociousshecreature challenges you!' and my number. Cute right? I walk up and say "you dropped this" hand it to him and walk away. Later on I pass him in the hall and he says "Challenge Accepted!" And I tell him well then he should text me! Several hours later he texts me, we talk, agree to hang out while my friends are in a panel I have no interest in. We go get food, hang out alone, hang out with some of his friends, we kiss, I introduce him to my friends, they don't like him (sign #2) and I tell him to catch up with his friends we will hang out later. 
Over texts we agree to go get a beer after the convention wraps up that evening. My friends depart and wish me luck, and I head to a gathering place to meet him. He doesn't answer any messages or calls for hours, and I wait for two hours past the time we agreed to meet before he even responds (sign #3). Four hours after we had agreed to meet he shows up. With another girl he had met earlier at the convention (sign #4). "Sorry I took so long. I lost my phone in her hotel room" (sign #5) 
So we go to the bar. He gets a ridiculous mixed drink that teenagers get when they first turn 18. I get a pint and a whiskey neat. The fucking waitress in this club doesn't know what neat is. God damn whisky in a cup. Anyway, he and the other girl proceed to talk about *another* girl that he met at the convention who "won't give him any play" (sign #6) obviously this makes me uncomfortable so I slam my drinks and catch the last bus home. This is where I should have thrown in the towel. Nope. To desperate. 
Few days later we agree to meet up and hang out. I straight up tell him I am only interested in sex. So we walk around for a bit. He has a very forthcomming personality so I figure he will make the first move in no time. No dice. So he says he is hungry. I suggest we go get something to eat. I should mention I am 22 he is 23. He says he has no money *we should go to his house and have some cereal or something because his parents already had dinner*. (Sign #7) I say I will pay lets go somewhere, are there ant decent pubs around? He suggests McDonalds (sign #8) but he doesn't want me to pay *he wants me to give him the money so that he can pay so that he doesn't look lame* (sign #9). I say whatever, I really need to get laid. He proceeds to buy and eat $20 worth of McDonald's because that is how much I gave him. (Sign #10). Finally after watching him stuff his face like an animal and yammer on about Naruto (I don’t like Naruto and told him as much but he felt the need to prove me wrong) (sign #11). I finally say "look it's late are we gonna go somewhere or am I catching the last train?" I was thinking of a hotel... or a fucking park or trail or something at this point. 
In the distance of metaphor-space a truck can be heard backing up.
*he calls his mom to ask if he can have a friend over*
You see the truck is full of signs. It's hazard lights illuminate as it raises the dump lift...
Of course he can have a friend over, *if his friend will help him clean his room*.
Signs #12-1736 proceed to tumble over me. 
Fuck it. I have come this far. I might as well get laid. We go to his place. He makes me fold his laundry while he takes a shower. Then complains because I did it wrong and proceeds to redo it all muttering that "next time you better do it right". He turns on *Conan O'Brian* for background noise. And we go at it. 
Of course because of murphy's law he has a huge dick and fucks like an animal. 
I am ashamed to say that for that reason I proceeded to see him for two months, only at my apartment, and with as little talking as possible because his personality was about as pleasant as curdled milk in the couch cushions. 
TL; DR felt like a pedophile sleeping with a guy a year older than me  
I had been crushing on this girl for months. She knew it, and I knew she liked me too, but she never would go out on a date with me for some reason (I think it was a clique thing as I wasn't one of the "cool kids"). We would always flirt like crazy, but never took it any further despite my many attempts. Finally one day she agrees out of the blue, and we schedule a movie for Friday.
We had never really had any time when it was just myself and her. It was always in a social situation, and only when we found ourselves in a semi-isolated part of a party or whatnot. She would always tone it way down in front of her friends.
Anyway, I pick her up, and it's like night and day. She's incredibly giddy/excited and even kisses me when I meet her at the door. We laugh and flirt for the whole drive, and everything is right with the world.
At some point before this day, we had decided that it would be a good "high" movie, and I promised to bring some weed. We had gotten caught up in the flirting/laughing on the drive, and when we finally got to the parking lot I said "oh yeah, did you want to smoke before we go in?" She agreed and we shared a J in the car. Mind you this is in the middle of summer, and my PoS car at the time didn't have AC. It was hot enough just driving, but after sitting in the car, in the sun, idle for 5 minutes, we were both thoroughly baked (both ways :)
When we finally walked into the theater, it was like a slap in the face walking into the AC'd lobby; similar to the momentary shock you get jumping into a cold pool. We got our tickets, and I noticed she looked pale, but didn't say anything. When we got to the concession stand, I ordered popcorn and asked her what she wanted to drink. She says " I can't see" and is getting all wobbly. My THC-addled brain can't process this, and I say "you want a Pepsi?". She then proceeds to collapse...
It's a Friday night at a large theater, so there are tons of people around, and you can hear the collective audible gasp when this happens. I'm just standing there in a stupor, blazed out of my mind, and people are asking "is she ok? does she have any medical conditions?". I think at best I stammered out "I.. I.. I don't know". (It doesn't help to be high in these situations). Thankfully after a minute or so (which felt like an hour) she wakes up.
Apparently she is one of those people who deal with embarrassment with anger, so once she gets up and sees everyone staring at her she runs off. I'm trying to walk with her, helping her stay upright as she is still staggering, but she keeps telling me to "leave her alone".
I finally get her to the car after she rebuffs all my "are you ok, what can I do?" questions, and she passes out again. She sleeps while I just sit there watching, making sure she's still breathing, etc. When she does wake up, she immediately asks to be taken home. The bitchiness is gone now, but she won't talk, so we have an incredibly awkward silence for 20 minutes on the drive home. I finally get to her driveway, and she has tears in her eyes, and says "I'm sorry I ruined our date Seraph". I try to explain that it's not a big deal at all and I just wish she'd talk to me, but she basically runs out of the car and goes inside.
This was pre-cell phone days, and while I think i had her number, it was probably written on a piece of paper somewhere that I couldn't find, so I just accepted my fate and went home crestfallen.
I kept hoping to bump into her at some gathering, but didn't see her for probably a month. When I did finally find her, all I wanted to do was to rush over and hug her, but she would actively avoid eye contact and stay huddled with her friends. This continued until I just gave up, but I still think about her to this day.
 ~~cock~~loveblocked by a joint 

I did the OkCupid thing one summer.  I had so many odd experiences....the one that I keep coming back to is when I went to see fireworks with this dude.  He seemed cool, we both lived in a suburb of our city and we thought it would be a good idea to go see fireworks. We easily could have gone right in the area that we lived in...but noo...let's drive 40 fucking minutes in traffic to see them in downtown, that seems like a swell idea.  Then he wanted to get beers; I'm easy to please, let's just get some PBR from the gas station, whatever.  NOPE!  (we're already running late at this point, I should mention) we had to drive to the liquor store that carries this one beer that he insisted I try.  Fine.  Then, oh the travesty, they don't fucking have it.  So let's bug the employees and make them look in the back and them pester them about when the next shipment is coming in.  PAIN IN THE ASS.  Then, finally settling on a beer, we drive to the fireworks.  At this point, he makes it obvious to me that he has music ADD and can't listen to a whole fucking song...I have no idea how many songs I heard the first 45 sec of that night. 
Soo..we see fireworks...I like fire and things exploding, so that's cool.
Then...he decides to wait in the parking garage for traffic to clear.  I had mentioned earlier in the night that I like yoga.  So he decides to make me watch videos of acro yoga.  Which is essentially, a man and a woman flipping one another around in awkward places.  He wanted to try this, I did not.
I finally get him to leave the parking garage.
This is when he also decides to introduce me to Dubstep.  Which he described to me as "ROBOT SEX."  Clearly he's setting the mood here...
Then he starts whipping out bowls and weed to show me "how dank his shit is."  I like all of these things, but not on the 4th when cops are everywhere directing traffic...don't be stupid.
Then we get stuck in traffic for an hour and a half. I've blocked out the rest of our conversations from my memory. When we get back to his place (where my car was) I promptly RUN to the other side of my car to avoid a goodnight...anything.  
20 minutes later he sends me a text: You seemed like you were in a huge hurry to leave, I hope it wasn't anything I did.
Don't let this story, (or the other OkCupid stories in this thread) keep you from online dating.  I actually met my current boyfriend about a month later.  We've been together for a year and a half.  All the bad dates lead to something good (sometimes).
  Never get a ride on your first date, and don't get stuck in traffic with the creeper either.  
I'm kinda late to the game, and it  might not be as bad as most of yours, but I'll share anyway.
For some reason I was really into this 6 foot, overweight guy who had the world's worst facial hair, long, shoulder length brunette hair and had the worst attitude of any ugly guy I've ever met. I was obviously into him but he was having none of it, but to my surprise one day he asked me out. As soon as I get to his place (I'm looking pretty cute-it is a date, after all), he greets me at the door by telling me, "Pick up a dog, we're taking them for a walk." So I have to grab one of his wiener dogs and carry him downstairs and walk around his shitty apartment complex until the dogs shat/pissed. The whole time he said like, two words.
The dogs were being jerks and didn't do their business, so as soon as we got back upstairs one of his dogs peed on the couch and the other one shit on the floor. Okay, I've had worse dates I think...so I shrug it off. Then, we watch some It's Always Sunny, but I'm sitting on this huge couch all by myself and he's all the way on the other side of the room in a recliner, drinking a beer and not looking at me at all. I have been feeling this date sucked, but at this point I think, "Why the hell would he ask me out if he's not interested?"
So then after a few episodes, he takes me into his bedroom (don't get too excited) to show me an organ that he built. An organ, the musical instrument. He proceeds to play me a piece that he wrote from it, and I can't help but want to kill myself as I'm staring at this dorky, weird 6 foot guy playing this shitty organ in his bedroom. And then he gets REALLY excited, and tells me he writes death metal songs. So then he shows me all of his death metal songs from his computer, which are pretty shitty in general. This went on for at least an hour.
After that, I asked him why he asked me out. He said "One of my friends thinks you're cute and knows you're interested in me, so he convinced me to give you a chance." He then told me that I wasn't his type, which I didn't ask, and he said that he would only date blonde hair blue eyed Scandinavian girls. We are in Texas, mind you. One of the smallest country towns in East Texas. How many Scandinavian girls do you think are walking around down here?
He told me then, "I mean, I guess if I was really drunk, and the lights were out...I could probably muster up the courage to fuck you."
I just got up and left.
** 6 foot organ and death metal enthusiast, shittiest day of my life.**
Not mine, but my little brother. A couple of girls and my little brother and his friend plan a date the girls change the time and his friend can't go anymore. Soon all but one girl also bail only the date idea (probably because this girl told them too cause she like my brother). They decided to see Thor 2. My older brother, my boyfriend, and I get in the car to take him to the theater. In the end my younger brother (who did not like the girl) and this girl were sandwiched between my older brother on the right and my boyfriend and I on the left. 
After the date her parents showed up yo pick her up, but she refused to get in the car in hopes of getting a kiss. So my brother had to wait until she gave up in 20 degree weather.
Brother reluctantly goes on a date with a girl, only to get 5th wheeled.
I was living with my best friend's Dad for a couple months.  He was dating this girl who I got to know and she wanted to introduce me to her daughter.  She was my age, doing her PhD in English, looked pretty from the photos etc.  Sounded great.
Our first date, we meet for coffee and that goes well.  She's interesting, funny, smart etc.  We agree to meet again.
Second date, I take her out for dinner.  More of the same.
I go out of town for a month for work (I'm a geologist) and we keep in contact over the course of the month; send several emails back and forth.
A couple days after I get back, she invites me over to her place for the night.  She'll make dinner, we'll hang out etc.  I get there, she opens the door and literally drags me into the apartment and into her bedroom. So we do that.  It was fun.
Now, the crazy begins.  She has to go to do something downtown quickly so I offer to drive.  It's about a 40 minute drive.  The entire trip, she goes through an entire run down of everything that is possibly wrong with her:
1.  Gets constant migraines
2.  Low blood pressure
3.  Anger issues
4.  Trust issues
5.  Bad shoulders
6.  Bad joints
7.  Self esteem issues
8.  Body image issues
9.  etc etc
Basically, she spent the entire 40 minutes there and back telling me everything that was wrong with her, all about her awful past relationships, on and on.
We get back to her place.  Start watching a movie on the couch.  She stands up to go get some water and "WHACK", hits the floor, completely fainted and unconscious.
At this point, I'm freaking out.  I check her breathing and pulse, both are good but she's still completely unconscious.  She kinda opens her eyes a bit and moans "sugar".  So I run to the kitchen, get her some water with sugar mixed in and give it to her.  
She drinks then and 5 minutes later she's up and giddy like nothing happened and casually mentioned "oh, I pass out like that if I forget to eat for the day".
Bed time, I go to get into bed with her and she tells me that she'll sleep on the couch because she thrashes uncontrollably during her sleep.
Next morning, we had breakfast and I made an excuse as to why I had to leave.  I couldn't deal with that many issues brought on that quickly.  We kept in contact for a few more months on a friendly basis but things sorted of faded.
  Girl passed out on 3rd date because she "forgot to eat".
This is the Question I was born to answer:
I have had over 200 first dates. I have had **a lot** of bad dates. I would like to post the story I am the biggest fan of. May I present ...
*The New Years Rape Caravan Spectacular!!**
Basically, in my early 20's and my ongoing quest for sex (I am 31 now, and have a very different set of objectives right now), I went out on a date with a woman I met online. Stupid me made the date for New Years Eve. Alot of pressure to have fun, and a big time commitment. Also, hard to bail on someone if there is there is no spark (which I have done, and have done to people. Quickest bail-out of a date for me was 90 seconds) 
I ended up meeting her at her place. She was local, but lived in a suburb I didn't know existed, and can't remember the name of. Very rural, you'd almost call it farm land, if the land was cultivated. More like the type of land you'd shoot Wild pigs on.
Anyway, met her, and things seem fine. She seems OK. After a short bit of getting to know each other, and seeing her place (an OK house) We ended up driving off to where we were going to celebrate New Years, which was a family gathering of hers. So its a first date, a major party night, and I'm meeting her entire family. Also, I'm letting her drive, so I am now wholly dependant on this person in getting me the fuck out of this awkward situation. 
I'm basically making mistake after mistake here.
We arrive at the party (another rural-ish property near by, but with more car-parts in the yard), and the first thing I see is the Aunt of my date, running around with with her top off, and her boobs out and flapping. Seems this aunt and another guest at the party were getting into a flashing contest. Now, my date didn't make our presence felt for a little while, so this contest went on for a good 5 minutes until someone realised there was a 'stranger' at the party. There was a little bit of shagrin from those involved.
The party then turned into your typical 'Boozy [Bogan]( BBQ' (this is an Australian story), and I am not connecting with anyone. Not my kind of people, sadly. I make my next mistake of the evening, say 'Fuck It' and start drinking. The mistake here is now I have totally fucked my ability to read a situation or escape on my own. I'm here for the duration.
Anyway, after a short while, my date decides to take me back to her place. Hooray, we're away from the awkward party, but at this point, I want nothing to do with this woman. Unfortunately, I am drunk enough that even when I get back to my own car, I don't wanna drive. The fact that we're surrounded by bushland, and I have no survival skill set, also means I am not running into the pitchblack wilderness (although I seriously consider it).
When we get there, we decide to kill some time . . . by watching the 2004 classic [Without a Paddle]( Yeah, so I watch the film for the following reasons:
* 10% cause I had never seen it.
* 30% because I'm too tipsy to escape.
* 60% because I really didn't want to do anything with this woman at all that could be construed as sexual interest.
I will argue that no one has so intently watched Without a Paddle in their life as I had. She keeps answering txts on her phone. I asked her what was going on, and it is at this point that she confides that she was a former prostitute, and that she was fielding requests for a New Years [root]( (again, Australia) from former clients and people who know her.
Now, the fact I've made no moves on this woman should have indicated to her that I was not keen on anything happening that night. However, she took the fact I sat for the entire film without trying something was because I was a 'good guy', and she really wanted a good guy in her life. 
She invites me back to her room, and won't take no for an answer. I am young and stupid enough, that I think that there is no way I can say no to a woman in this situation (I have a much better understanding of things now).
Now, her 'room' isn't actually in her house. It's her family's house, and she lives out the back in a caravan. Gives her privacy. We get out there. Now, this detail is the one that sticks with me several years later, and isn't the weirdest thing that should stick out to me from the evening, but it is. The detail is this:
**She had the mattress for a double bed, but the frame for a single bed**
I have no idea if she was poor, or a truly diabolical genius, but this bed kept forcing me to be close to her, lest I roll off the sagging edge of the mattress, and onto the floor. I tried to sleep the night away, but she was very 'hands on' and tried making something happen. In Clinton-ian terms, I did not have sexual relations with that woman, but enough happened that I didn't want to happen. 
The next morning, I got the fuck out of there, and showered like there was no tomorrow. I never saw her again, and my life was the richer for it.
**- I rung in the New Year being 'raped' in a caravan'**
I met a nice girl over OkCupid and decided to give it a chance. We chatted, and she was very chipper, a decent conversationalist, and seemed down to earth. I thought I had made a score for sure, so when we arranged for coffee and a movie I was was rather excited. I received her address, and I was off! Things started to go downhill from there. I arrived, and her home is in a bad part of town. I sit outside waiting, and as she leaves I hear people fighting. She gets in my car, and she smiles at me. She was a sweet, nice girl, but her teeth were just awful. Any hope for attraction was gone. I hoped, however we could have good conversation. She just stared at me. At my lips. I withdrew into my dark place.
I proceeded to take this girl to coffee, and a movie, the whole time with her trying to make a move on me. Cloudy with Chance of Meatballs still carries traumatic memories.
Afterward, she texted me non stop trying to secure a second date. I declined, and cut contact, successfully making the only thing I secured from the date a heightened sense of feeling like a shallow asshole.
 When people don't smile in pictures, there might be a reason. Internet dating turns you into a callous, shallow person.
Went to dinner at a diner. We were comfortable enough with each other that we had 'comfortable silence.' It was raining heavily that  day and I was staring out the window watching the rain (I love rain !)... Anyway across the aisle from us was a creepy seemingly homeless looking guy sitting alone.. In the middle of my trance my boyfriend loudly says to the guy ' is there a problem? You keep looking over here and staring at her (me)' the guy just kept stating 'just looking out the window' .... It was humiliating, my friends told me to 'get out!!'... I stayed for over 7 years, yeah he could be jealous.
jealous boyfriend accused some guy of staring at me very loudly in a diner.. Guy was just looking out the window.
My ex basically brought this up while in the car on our first date, with me driving. I told her she was right, that I could totally kill her and some comment about murder being totally hawt. She thought it was funny and the rest is history. 
murdered girl on first date
Started talking to a really cool guy. Sweet, funny, kinda sassy, fluent in sign language (big plus), smoked pot, "didn't drink often at all"... Met him at a party, stayed for about half an hour while I stood there awkwardly, finally left, went to his place, smoked a bit, went to Denny's... He spent, all together, maybe an hour and a half puking in the bathroom. He was gone for so long at one point the waitress gave me *THE* look of pity that said "I'm so sorry your date left you". Turned out, he was a stereotypical 21 one year old gay man with no maturity. He couldn't understand why I didn't kiss him goodbye, or why I wouldn't do a second date. Also found out he generally puked in people's cars after drinking.
 knowing ASL isn't a good enough reason to date some one.
BONUS: There was a guy I went to stay the night with, ended up walking him after he claimed to associate with the blonde mom on Hairspray and had the same opinion as her on race.

a guy i had kind of known in high school asked me out a short time after my long term high school boyfriend and i broke up. he was cute and nice and i had never really heard anything bad about him so i thought, why not?! whats the worst that can happen?
come to the night of the date, we had agreed to meet at a neutral place, i wasnt really comfortable with people knowing where i lived (i had a brief run in with a stalker) so i show up to the parking lot of the mall that we were meeting at maybe 5-10 minutes late but had sent him a text to apologize and let him know. well, im sitting there and get nothing for about 15 minutes, about now im thinking, "awesome, first date since leaving a serious relationship and im being stood up" accepting it, i get ready to turn around and drive home when all of a sudden he texts and says he's pulling in now.
i get in his truck and were off, now he wouldnt tell me where we were going or what we were doing but i was trying to be nice and open minded, i later learned this was a bad choice. 
this guys dad was a landscaper and had his own business, i only put this in the story because this guy brought me to the shed that the kept all the machinery and stuff in. for two hours he kept me here while i was very conscious of every move he made and not letting him get behind my back out of worry that he was going to stab me.  it was a really weird and uncomfortable experience. he kept calling it the BatCave, and i just wanted out. trying to be polite i played along for about 15 minutes but after that would bring up maybe calling it a night or going somewhere else (somewhere more public).
well two hours later i finally convinced him to take me back to my car and put an end to anything that could ever come out of that terrifying experience.
a couple weeks later i was waitressing at a popular wing restaurant and he shows up absolutely trashed with his friend. i tried to ignore them and not make eye contact and thankfully they got seated at the bar and i didnt have to work with him directly but any time he saw me he would shout and say things and him and his friend just kept drinking for hours. my shift was over and i had to tip out the bartender so i had to go up near them and there was no way of getting around it but i politely said yes. he then asked me out on another date and began bragging about how much he had had to drink and how wasted he was. i was not impressed and did not want to talk to him anymore so i kind of lost it a little bit and yelled at him about how irresponsible he was being because i knew he had every intention of driving home. he and his friend got quiet, i packed my things up and went home. i haven't seen him since, and it has been four years.
guy took me to his dads shop/shed that he kept all of his knives and lawnmowers in for two terrifying hours.
I loved the lol!!!
upvote for the hahahaha
My worst date was coincidentally the first time I tried internet dating. I had set up an OkCupid account and gotten a few nibbles in the first few days. Eventually, I found a girl who was decent looking with an interesting profile. Messages were exchanged, dinner and a movie was set up. 
On the big day, we both pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant at the same time. I recognized her face from her photo and got out of my car to meet her as she did the same. Right away, I noticed that she was a head and a half taller than I was (I'm 5'7") which was a little awkward, but hey, eye level with boobs is not a bad position to be in. I was about to introduce myself when she reached back into her car and pulled out a small jar. Her first words to me were, and this is a direct quote:
"Hey, I found this spider on my front porch when I left my house. It's a really cool spider, and I don't know what kind it is. Do you know anything about spiders?"
I looked. To be fair, it was an interesting looking spider. Some sort of crab spider with a white shell with black dots. However, this was not making the already awkward sport of internet dating any less awkward. I replied,
"No...and I'm Arch_Radish. Good to meet you."
It went downhill from there. Dinner was mostly dead air with both parties trying desperately to find some common ground to talk about. She seemed very nervous and shaky the whole time. I tried to make conversation to lighten the mood, asking open ended questions and all that, but she just replied with vague or one-word answers.
We decided to proceed with the movie, which was right across the highway. We both got in our respective cars and drove over. When we arrived, she brought the spider back out and started asking a lot of questions about it again. There was an unknown substance in the jar next to the spider. She wanted to know exactly what that was. I'm no Unidan, but I tried explaining the concept of spider shit to her. She seemed surprised that spiders could shit. But at least the damn spider started up some much-needed conversation.
We went in to see the movie and things went way downhill again. The movie was a B-movie slasher wannabe called Sorority Row, which was her choice. I was hoping for at least a few slasher-inspired jumps and fear grabs, but nothing. I did manage to get my arm around her shoulders once, but not for long as the blood quickly drained from my arm at that altitude.
Afterward, after making yet another checkup on the spider and helpfully suggesting putting air holes in the lid, we walked to the local bookshop for a coffee. We made a few more attempts at small talk before she finally confessed.
"Look, I find you very intimidating."
I stopped, made a great show of looking up at her face, and said, "Really, what makes you think so?"
"Well, you just have a very intimidating voice."
To her credit, I do have a rather deep voice for my height. But in my mind, a first-time internet dater going up against an Amazonian with a spider fetish gave her a few more points in the intimidation department. I honestly didn't know what to say to that, so, we walked quietly back to her car where we hugged goodbye, and she deleted her profile the next day.
I've had plenty of awkward internet dates since then, and lots of things have gone wrong. But no matter what I achieve in my romantic life, I don't think I'll ever reach "having to explain spider shit in my manly pipes of doom" level of bad.
EDIT: **Blind internet date with an Amazonian spider woman, deep voiced midget, and arachnid shit.**
Met a guy online and after texting and emailing for a week decided to meet him at a friends party. He got along with everyone and was very friendly and charming. He even had the grace to ignore an acquaintance of mine drunkenly hitting on him all night. Then, another friend of mine started fighting with him for turning down our drunk friend! He also handled this well but was understandably upset. I felt horrible for the way the night was going and, although the original safety plan was to spend the night there, we decided to leave. It was in the AM hours and he was just going to drop me off. Besides, after how well he had handled himself all night I felt fine with him driving me home.
We get in his car and he starts questioning me about who I'm texting. I was just letting the owner of the house know that I was bailing and told him as much. He asked me who I had been talking to earlier on my phone and I told him how my roommate had been locked out of our apartment. She called to ask if I was close or if she should head to her sisters for the night. He didn't believe me so I actually showed him my call log with the name Brandy being the only other number to have called me. He then got pissed at me for taking a call while we were at the party, convinced I had been talking to other men, and proceeded to yell at me. This lasted for almost the whole 20 minute ride home escalating all the way to *"This is why you get cheated on!!"* with my reaction going from stunned silence to "This guy is going to kill me. How am I going to get out of this?" to "Who the fuck does he think he is!?" 
I finally snapped less than a mile from my apartment complex and, breaking my silence, told him exactly what I thought of his behavior. Stupidly yelling over him until he stopped yelling at me. He was quiet for a couple minutes after I finished telling him how the night went from my perspective, said something about how it was a shame my friends were going to think *he* was the jerk and then started bawling. I awkwardly comforted him both feeling bad and hoping to make it into my apartment safely. After a minute long hug in the parking lot he insisted on walking me up to my door, asked if he could come in, and totally didn't rape me for saying no. He just called me a bitch. I was so relieved when I finally got to turn the deadbolt. My roommate later called it Meeting *All* The Personalities.
EDIT: words
I thought that maybe I wouldn't make it home at all.
Met this British guy online.  We texted for a while then decided to meet.  First date went extremely well, gave him a good night kiss and was feeling pretty positive about the night.   We continued to talk after that, and about two weeks later we went out again.  Our second date was going to be volunteering in our community. Of course, we had to pick the HOTTEST day in the summer.  I went over to his place to pick him up and he wasn't ready, said that we needed to stop by Walmart to pick up some boots on the way.  No problem, I thought; taking him to WalMart.  Well, everyone in the city seemed to h ave the same idea and no boots to be found.  We went to about 5 other stores searching; and finally he says, "lets just go back to my place, watch a movie and I'll make dinner".  So we head back.  I walk into his place, and it is filthy, with a big dirty dog.  The white couch is covered in ground in dirt; and the floors had obviously  not been mopped for some time.  I picked the spot on the couch that seems the cleanest and awkwardly start watching a movie.  His place does not have air conditioning, so we are both starting to feel the heat.  He then asks me if I wanted to go downstairs because its cooler.  I oblige.  He said his tenants had moved out about a week ago. We get downstairs and there's a small tv, a couch that's not AS dirty (that I could tell anyways) and a coffee table with a hotplate on it. There were a mountain of dishes on this hotplate; and he blamed it on his tenants (they left a bunch of dishes behind).  Movie is pretty boring, so I make the excuse to use the washroom.   Washroom is probably the most disgusting thing I have ever seen, mold in the corners, mirror so dirty that you couldn't even see; toilet stained and just scary all around.  I do my thing and realize there is NO toilet paper.  Just my luck.  Look ahead and there was a nook that had the wire storage shelves in it.   I take a closer look and  it is full of dirty dishes.  Just piles of dirty dishes.  The one pot that was right in my line of vision was half full of cooked spaghetti, that was still somewhat moist (not on display long enough to dry out).  Who eats spaghetti in their dirty bathroom?  Now I know this isn't from the tenants, but now realize the fact that he is an absolute pig.  I get out of there as soon as I can, without it being blatantly obvious that I am horrified, but I sure didn't want to eat leftover bathroom spaghetti for lunch.  Texted him the next morning saying that I didn't feel anything and it was over.  By far one of the most bizarre situations I've ever been in....   (and the first date went over so well!)  
**TL: DR went on a second date with an absolute slob, who had a pot of cooked spaghetti in his bathroom.  I was afraid he'd try to feed it to me for lunch.**
well... most professional schools do require more than grades.  i've said this so many times but the downtown campus offers a crap load of opportunities right next to where you go to classes, it's just up to students to take advantage of them.  
and if a student thinks u of t is hurting his/her chances at professional school, it's a free world - switch to another school.  i hear way too many people bitching and moaning about how much torture u of t is but isn't proactive about making any changes at all.  maybe it's you (using 'you' in a general sense, not aiming at /u/SgtSmackdaddy or anyone else in particular) that's the problem rather than the school?  some people just need to take a deep, hard look at their studying habits and see that whatever worked for them in high school likely isn't what's going to work at u of t.
personally, i can't speak to whether or not u of t is harder than other schools, as i've been here for all of my 7 years of university education... so i think it's unfair for me to comment whether or not ryerson/york/&lt;other school&gt; is supposed to be cruise control vs u of t.  but i can say in most cases that each grade i've got is the grade i've earned (and i deserved many of my low 60s in my first 2 years of undergrad, as much as i hate to admit it), instead of "X prof/TA/program is so fucking hard and unfair!!!"  
 stop bitching, do something about it

I had a scaling whip from my campaign years ago. Every now and then it would grow an extra whip/tail so I could do multiple strikes with it in succession. It was the barbed whip of malice. Upon lashing someone it would release barbs into them that would cause them to bleed. Mwhahaha
Anyway you could do something like that where it could increase the utility. I'm doing something similar with my new campaign, I'm giving someone a shortsword that can effectively clone itself so they can dual wield. Upon reaching a later level they will be able to throw daggers from the blade as a standard action.
 Utility instead of extra damage. (Thats what I prefer though)
Mostly, the US's major mistake in post-Soviet Russia was to impose market fundamentalist "shock therapy".  This lead to cronyism/oligarchs, and also widespread hardship and economic contraction.  Both of these lead to Putin and the present state of authoritarian Russia.

My dad changed his cell number a while back, but because I'm smart, I added a new contact instead of updating the old one.  Of course, one night, I called the old number...it went like this:
*ring ring*
Stranger: Hello?
Me: Hi...Dad? (Realizing that, while it sounded a lot like my dad, something was off)
Stranger: ...Hello?
Me: Dad?
Stranger: I never had a son...I have two daughters.
Me: Oh...I think I have the wrong number.
Stranger: That's fine...I always wanted a son!  Have a good night, my boy!
Me: Hahaha...good night!
**** I was adopted by a phone stranger.
I was making these Italian cookies called "Nacatoli" with my mom, cousin, aunt, and uncle. These cookies are native to my grandma's hometown in Italy so not many people know about them but they're a family favorite. So my cousin took a picture to send to our other uncle.
Cousin: Hey, Uncle Frank, it's Alyssa. Look what we're making for Christmas!
Stranger: Those look delicious. Only one problem: I'm not your Uncle Frank.
So a few hours later, my mom decided it would be funny to text him from her number with the same picture and say something along the same lines.
My mom: Hey, Uncle Frank! Look it's your favorite!
Stranger: Again, they look super delicious but I think you should talk to Alyssa cause I'm not Uncle Frank. Good luck finding him though!
So a few days later my mom gets a text from this guy:
Stranger: So here's what my family is making for Christmas! (insert picture of homemade wine) Hope you eventually found Uncle Frank!
Then on Christmas Eve we sent him a picture of our homemade wine and wished him a Merry Christmas.
 Wrong text turns into weeks of Christmas food picture exchanges.
In the ninth grade, I got a text that said, "Hey, how's it going? It's Sam! :)" My immediate thought was that it was the cute girl named Sam from my drama class. We went on texting all night, started flirting in the disgusting way that 13 year olds do I told her I'd liked her for a while, and she said she had always had a crush on me. We decided to go on a date. I asked if we should just meet up after drama class the next day, and she told me she wasn't in drama. 
* "But, I just saw you in drama yesterday!" 
* "Umm, nope!"
* "... Is this not Sam Smith?"
* "...Let's never talk about this."
**Wrong Sam.**

First off: go you, for being *smart*! No-contact till you're secure and having fun on your own was 100% the right choice :)
So, now here you are, an intelligent-but-heartbroken young woman; what to do? Here's a couple of day-to-day suggestions:
* **Be ok with being sad, at least for now**. You did lose something of tremendous value to you, so don't beat yourself up if you experience sudden crying-jags watching sad commercials or seeing people holding hands on the street. That's natural and it happens. Just let yourself feel the loss, then wipe your eyes and continue on with the rest of your day.
* **Use your support system!** You're in a sorority which means you should have a lot of friends and structured activities to keep you busy. I'm not talking about socials/mixers though: talk to your philanthropy chair about taking on a more active role. Join a sports club on campus. Get out and do things even when you just want to hole up in your room- *especially* when you just want to hole up in your room.
* **Tell your sisters &amp; friends that you don't want to hear anymore talk about the ex, and that it is NOT helpful for them to suggest that y'all might get back together**. Instead, let them know if they want to help they can help you find fun new ways to fill your day. 
* **Accept that his issues are his own, and you'll never really know WHY he broke it off**. You're going to want to analyze everything he did up to what he ate for breakfast before the break-up, but *resist* this urge! Maybe he's depressed, maybe he met someone else, maybe he is committment-phobic, maybe tiny green men crawled in his ear and hijacked his brain: no matter what the cause, the outcome is the same, and *the outcome is the only thing you have to work with*. So chalk this up as one of the great mysteries of life, and work on the only real route to closure: figuring out how to be happy and fulfilled on your own. 
You are young, and smart, and yes, you'll likely meet someone else who you will love even more-- but the most important thing you can take from this experience is learning how to **be resilient and take charge of your own happiness**. That's going to do so much more for you that any SO ever could. 
So, in fashion: Keep up the no-contact, be ok with feeling sad for a bit, keep busy and don't dwell on the past, and take charge of your own life. I **promise**, it's going to be a great one. :)
Yeah those are both excellent points. One possible Muslim view is that everything came about the same way as atheists believe it did, except God created Adam separate from everything else as a special case.
My own view is that if you pay careful attention to the way the creation of Adam is described in the Qur'an, you find two major events, which is that 1) Adam was physically formed, and 2) God breathed His soul into Adam. So my personal belief is basically that Adam was born from non-human parents that were very much like humans, but lacked human souls or a human level of consciousness, and in a miraculous event Adam became the first human when God endowed him spiritually/mentally. After Adam, other people became human, including Eve and the spouses of Adam and Eve's children (perhaps being human can be learned). The verses saying Adam was shaped from clay is an analogy for humans' physiological development which we all share (clay meaning physical matter, Earth, as opposed to fire, what jinn are made from, and whatever it is angels are made of).
I did once listen to an Islamic scholar being asked how Adam and Eve's children found spouses, or if they were allowed to marry their siblings. The scholar basically said just as God created Adam and Eve, he was able to make other humans to accompany them. This fundamentally in agreement with what I said, and even in the Torah there is the mystery of Cain's wife, which suggests that Adam and Eve and their children were not the only people around at that time.
I think Adam belonged to a group of proto-humans, and Adam got promoted to full human status through an act of God.
Meh. I googled it so I could reply. People simply won't sell bonds for lower than gold farmers, it'd be a complete waste of money. 
On the other hand, now gold farmers can jack up the prices of gold, now that legit gold selling is so high. But they'll never sell higher than bonds, because then what's the point of even buying from them? 
Legal&gt;Illegal in terms of how much YOU have to pay.
Simply put: shoot something until it dies from it. 
Put it this way, if you have a unit which is very dangerous to you,  your priority should be to consentrate fire on it until it dies.
If you then have several enemy units of the same type or danger level, then you need to manage your fire power in a way which at least does the max damage each turn. 
As a dark eldar player for example, my goal is to at least make sure I shake or stun each shooting vehicle in my oppanants army, to at least insure im not wiped out from enemy fire next turn. In this vein I must put my target priority on the most shooty unit/tank until it is at least shaken, then move on.
Target priority is asking yourself 'what needs to die or be destroyed this turn to reduce my own loses or win me the game'.
Another way of looking at it is to look at enemy close combat units . If you have a unit which you need to soften up before your cc unit charges it, then you may need to focus some fire on it to do so.
A good way to think of it is like this: every turn you have a limited amount of shots, how can you use those each turn to do as much effective damage as possible.
 target priority is using the limited amount of shooting attacks you have to your best advantage each turn 
When I'm in towns I play in first person. Running for half an hour through the woods and I'll use third person. It's uncomfortable for me to play in first person for extended periods of time while travelling. I feel more connected to my character when I can see it while running around too.
 For me, combat/towns/airfields = 1st person, running around = 3rd person.
From reading the article, I'm pretty sure an aid did make the threat to withhold the funds if they didn't approve the project.  I think the question is whether Chris Christie knew about what his aids were doing?

Hello r/motorcycles. I've been looking into getting a bike for a while and I have a few worries. I've ridden a bike before, and I've taken a friends gs500 on a careful ride with great success. I've gone back and forth on what bike I should consider getting, I was hoping you guys could help. 
I'm kinda short at 5'8", I'm skinny, at 120 lbs, and I'm worried about that limiting what bikes I can ride comfortably. As a beginner, I can't stand the idea of not having my feet on the ground. 
I've looked at pretty much every kind of bike, and everything tickles my fancy except big cruisers like Hareys. I'd love a dirt bike to take the Arizona trails. I'd love a street bike, because I really wouldn't get to the trails often. I'd love an adventure bike for its comfort and useability everywhere. I think the Honda NC700X is ideal, but I don't know if the size would be too much. 
What size bike would a 5'8", 120lb skinny kid be good on? And is there any certain type of bike that is better for small people, other than cruisers? 
the reflex training reminds me a lot of a test i once took for diagnosing ADD...
i had to pull a trigger they had rigged to a computer that was randomly flashing either one white box or two white boxes. the objective was to pull only on the one box, not on the two, or something like that and they would record response times and failures and it would tell them something. i borderline passed because i "turned it into a game" so they drugged me anyways. the amphetamines the gave me literally put me to sleep in class so i didn't take them and i never finished high school. 
now that i am in college i still don't take meds of any kind but i have been getting mostly A's for the last couple semesters...
i don't have any sort of evidence to support my theory, but i would like to thank counter-strike for teaching me how to focus on objectives and think clearly under pressure.
 i think counter-strike killed my ADD and gave me A's...
1. Well you've got a good battery. That's a matter of hardware quality (which I will admit seems pretty good from Apple, but they're still designed around looks rather than function).
2. Any PC/Mac/Linux PC can boot in seconds if the OS is on an SSD. My 7200RPM HDD can boot Windows in ~10-15 seconds. It's slow compared to SSD times, but not slow enough to have time to make a cup of tea.
3. If you're just browsing the internet, you *never* need to upgrade anything. My 4+ year old laptop can handle surfing the web fine, and it's running on some pretty shit hardware. Macs are just PCs with a closed-down OS anyway. Their hardware is pretty much equal to a PC: Upgrading is a matter of hardware age, not the OS.
4. Turn off virus scanning then. And also take not that you don't need an antivirus if you use common sense and download from trusted sources. I haven't had a single virus since turning off my antivirus software. Have one installed in case, but you never really need to scan at all unless you think you've downloaded a dodgy file.
 Mac = PC in all those arguments. You've only experienced them on Mac so you've come to the conclusion that they only exist on Mac.
battlemats are the way to go unless you really want to commit to buying tons of gear over time. I have a normal size one we use 90% of the time and then one of the ginormous ones for special uber battles. They're great, you can scribble notes about temp conditions and such.
&gt; It's a game of imagination. Unless you have endless cash, you'll eventually have to pretend that your fancy orc figure is an elven warrior anyway.

As for tokens, [check this google images link out.]( That's a totally half-assed search and it still came up with a few printable images. Take those to a print shop and have em run some off on cardstock and boom, tokens galore. Or make your own by taking images you like and turning them into tokens in something like Photoshop. Funny/cool picture of goblin &gt; crop to a circle shape &gt; copy 20 times to fill a page &gt; print, there's 20 gobs.
Also even without using glass beads or Sorry tokens or whatnot you can get tons of cheapo little figs that weren't made for RPGs that are close enough to 30mm scale that they work. Just in Toys R Us or whatever I've found $5 tubes of knights and men at arms and stuff you can use...
and some "real" plastic minis are pretty cheap - [here's another quick, half-assed search](
you don't have to spend a bunch of money on figs and stuff.
That being said there are some really nice ones and every once in awhile I do like to spring for the real thing for effect. But save money on the little stuff by using your imagination
The reference to standard English was, I believe, with regard to written language. I agree with you that spoken language must only be coherent to the target audience to be "valid", and I suppose the same argument could be made for written language. However, writing has generally been more formal and codified than spoken language, especially in formal settings. While minor points of grammar or spelling differ between the English skating populations of the world, there is a generally agreed upon standard. As for spoken language, while I've touched on the validity of aave or any other dialect, a formal spoken dialect is generally expected in business, etc. This is why code switching is a thing.
 Speak what you will, but in formal situations and in writing, there is a reasonable expectation of using standardized formal English.
Edit: Not a linguist either, just another dilettante

No, it's not just in your head
And what have you being a fan for a long time, got to do with general 'glory-hunting' fans? We're not talking about you and me. Big clubs will ALWAYS have glory-hunting fans, that's just the way it works, and my point was just that you were being a hypocrite for saying that the guy above you are a glory hunter which *you* don't know anything about, when you could be just as much of a glory hunter yourself, which none of *us* know anything about. Also the fact that both Barcelona and Juventus have tons of these kinds of fans.
all big clubs have glory hunting fans, but please don't call randoms on the internet glory hunters when you know knotting about them and their relations to the club they support / are a fan of.
I used to be like her. The best suggestion I have for you is to wait until a calm time and talk to her. It doesn't have to be a big production or a big sit down. And don't make this about you, at first. Casually approach this and plant the first seed. I'd go about it like this. Start talking about something you want to change about yourself. Everyone has a habit or something they want improved, eating better, more patient, things like that. When the conversation circles to what she would like to improve, get to the anger and just ask her if she is happy how she is now.
People who are quick to anger, that burn up and out like a match temper, they aren't happy that way. She's not happy that she's easily irritated. Plant a seed about trying to work on and improve that trait. That burn up shit, it is part behavioral but also part neurological. The neurological side is the impulsive anger and frustration. The behavioral side is that she recognizes it's fucked up and ends it as soon as her mind isn't on fire. However, it takes behavioral changes, over a long period of time to recondition a person's neurological response to stress. So, if you get it in your head that a sit down, ultimatum, or anything like that will get a quick change, sorry, but you will be disappointed.
If the method of changing for herself doesn't seem to plant itself, approach from the aspect of how it is hurting you. If you can make her understand that her behavior is hurting you then there is a good chance that she'll start the process of working on this. Google things, perhaps breathing techniques and meditation can help..
there is nothing you can say to quell the Hulk, but you can motivate her to start working on tempering her responses to stress. 
Building off of this, I think Punk coming back from "leaving" was done way too early.  I get that it was Summerslam and yada yada yada.  They could have stretched it out to the Rumble if they really wanted.  Give punk a very long leash to go to other smaller companies with the WWE belt to "defend" it then talk shit about WWE.  Have him tweet about it and post YouTube videos or whatever.  
At the same time have the "new" title like they did in WWE.  Punk mocks this as well.  
And just like he did at ComicCon(?) have him show up to an event or press conference and talk shit to Triple H, Cena, or whoever else.  Then have him come back at the end of a PPV, knock out the "champ", and claim his dominance.
**- What they did when Punk left was exciting.  They should have done it for way longer.**
Keeping Cena the top guy. I'm not hating the guy, hes a great worker and a great talent, but having him always in top feuds and the only way to beat him is by having interference or someone playing dirty. There is the odd chance he gets beaten cleanly, but theres always an excuse even then. Why not have several top guys, pit them against one another without leaning on one side more then the other. 
***   have several top stars, similar to 2002-2004 era.
If the business is cyclical, which WWE constantly claims it to be when people question their ratings, yeah it would. If the business were cyclical we'd be right at a nearing the new "attitude era" sometime soon.
The problem is the industry is in such a different place than the mid-90s this is complete unknown territory. The WWE is the only game in town (note: yes TNA is around, but WWE seems to not even care they exist), they're about to launch a network that almost every wrestling fan will have, and might be reworking a television deal that will make them more money than they ever have had from television revenue.
With the network, the sales they're making now, and everything else...they really have very little reason to change how they program. Want attitude? Network old PPVs. Want hardcore? Network old PPVs. As WWE buys more companies (ROH, TNA) that library grows and the need to change keeps itself away. Eventually, new kids are watching and all that thus making the need to change seem needed less.
Plus, they'll never go back to that level of violence. Studies on concussions, worries over transmittable diseases, and just personal safety will keep that stuff from coming back. Would enough be different, at that point, to even change the PG rating? You might get more swear words, but even the attitude era adult storylines could be corny and stupid: Val Venis' penis chopped off, PMS, etc.
But maybe if a million people sign up for the network and 80% of them watch ECW or attitude era material they'll change how the show goes.
almost any answer pertaining to "what will happen" with the WWE has almost fundamentally changed with the WWE Network announcement and what it actually entails.
Hah. I've got two stories dealing with bows.
Before I joined the group, they had a guy who couldn't understand why his characters always died. He had brought in a new character that was caught sneaking around the already paranoid about assassins group. So, the group had their three archers hold him at bowpoint as they talked to him. Said new character then drew his sword to hold it at the neck of the leader of the party. And he then was bitching at the table about why his character was killed..

Then, with my orc hunter, 2/3rds the party was dropped off the cliff. The huge wolverine Druid with a human form, then myself, then my wolf, then an Inquisitor, then it was a shield fighter and magus. Well, turns out a lot of undead were on top this plateau. Inquisitor uses a spell to teleport from the rope binding that we were using to bring the party up the cliff behind the wolverine and between the rope suddenly snapping, the undead 15 feet away and my frustration and trying to prevent the undead from attacking me, I missed by control animal roll. Wolf flipped the fuck out and crit the rope, dropping the remaining 10 members (large party) off the cliff. Took em ~40 turns of spell casting and floating slowly up to rejoin us. 
Well, we finally got to that bossfight but not in time to prevent a ritual from awakening the Sleeping Tyrant (Pathfinder, cant remember his full name). Inquisitor was fucked dead (1 HP, ported in front of a giant skeleton, as an archer..), so it was down to me and the druid to fight off 20 undead. At the end, we had to break down this shield to get to the lich enacting the ritual. I couldn't do anything with no spells left so I kept holding my action for when the shield dropped. As soon as it dripped, I rolled 3 natural 20s in a row, with double shot. This was a boss fight that was going to kill at least 5 party members, that I just one shot. The way we do rolls is if you roll a natural 20, you roll again. If you roll a miss for the second roll, its just a normal hit. If you hit with the second roll, you do crit damage. When I rolled that second 20, the DM and everyone at the table just said fuck it, roll it again!. Welp, here comes the third natural 20 on a third d20. 
 dropped half the party off a cliff, made up for it by oneshotting a lich that would kill a good part of the party.
Eh, I'm not gonna tell you how to run your game. I personally don't find a little extra npc work that hard, but I also have like 60 or 70 half made characters laying around that are pretty easy to convert to cohorts. But I've always enjoyed leadership both as a player and as a dm. On one side it gives me access to other skills I might not have, but as a dm it gives me another way to fuck with the party too. Its all in how you play it, but it's not for everyone.
I like leadership in my games but it's not for everyone.
I know i didn't have to, i just wanted to. Not so much for me, but to explain the other side to the players. I think if everyone knows all the information we can all be better consumers and create a better economy for the game.
We do make money from sheer volume of sales like you suggest, and the higher than MSRP products that I am talking about are the ones of limited quantity, where volume cannot make up more profit simply because there is no more volume to had. 
I literally can only sell 2 blue decks a week because that is all I can order. I'll sell those for what i need too and make my profit on the back end selling the unwanted decks for their MSRP at $30. Eventually all of those decks will sell, and if they are already paid for, than I can let them sit and it wont cost me anything. Meanwhile all the stores that sold theirs cheaper, or gave them away, basically just gave up on that profit. Which is absolutely fine, perhaps that giveaway helped their event turnout or whatever, it's all cool.
 I'm not trying to justify, nor am I upset that people shop elsewhere. I just wanted to share my unique perspective being that I have seen alot of people who seemed to not all have all the answers in regards to the question.
The thing that basic supply and demand leaves out is dead inventory.
I run the books for a small business, and dead inventory is the bane of my existence.  Say I've got 6 sets of Commander 2013.  The Mind Seize and Eternal Bargain decks are going to fly off the shelves.  I'm reasonably certain that I can move Evasive Maneuvers, and maybe Nature of the Beast.
But fucking Power Hungry.  It's gonna take a long, long time for me to move Power Hungry.
That means that the shelf space that 6 Power Hungry decks are taking up can't be used for anything else.  That's terrible.  That shelf space isn't free.  Even usable piece of the shop has expenses to cover--rent, utilities, staff wage/benefits, insurance, everything that's required just to keep a business open.  That's what it costs to have **an empty shelf**.  To put a product on it costs whatever the Vendor price is.  With an MSRP of $30 a piece, those six Power Hungry decks have cost me $90 on top of the shelf space.  The longer they sit there, the more they cost me.  Those Mind Seize and Eternal Bargain decks?  They were there for three days.  They cost me three days worth of shelf maintenance money.  The Power Hungrys cost months and months worth.  Months that could have gone to high value, high mobility merchandise like miniatures or other Magic cards.
But wait, there's more!  Commander 2013 came out at the end of the year, which means that those Power Hungrys are still in the store on December 31st.  That means that, as liquidatable, active inventory (I'm in manufacturing, and I know that our inventory no longer counts as "active" if it hasn't been sold in four years; I don't know the exact timeframe for retail), meaning that they count towards the total value of my business **and I have to pay taxes on them.**  Those Mind Seize and Eternal Bargains decks?  I didn't have to include them in my yearly statement because they were *fucking gone.*  Sure, I have to charge sales tax, but I'm gonna do the same to those Power Hungrys if they ever sell.
 Merchandise that doesn't move is expensive from a multitude of angles that aren't immediately obvious, and becomes more expensive over time.
That's cute. I live in Cleveland, I have 8-9 card shops I can go here to play magic. If I wanted to, I could play standard and limited competitively every single day of the week, and still not visit half the stores around me.
None of the stores here sell packs for below $4. There's the rare "3 for 11" deal sometimes, but that's it. There's only one store in this area that sells booster boxes for under $100 now. Only TWO of the stores even employ people (by that I mean almost all of the stores are literally ran by the owner alone), so that expense is non-existent. Most of them have shitty prize support, and if their prize support is decent the store itself either has a crappy player base or the owners will try and fuck you over a different way, like preying on new players or gullible people.
- Fuck you. 
&gt;  One special item isnt paying their bills. Its a one time money grab that is disgusting to me as a consumer. 
Whoa. "Disgusting"? FTV is an *extremely* limited edition product with extremely valuable cards inside, generally worth more for the buyer to pull apart and immediately sell as singles than the inflated price that it was sold at in most stores that have it. Why would anyone sell anything for $40 when it is worth at least $120?
The point of FTV and its low MSRP is to give stores a profit bump, thereby keeping them happy, trading and providing their service to magic players. The purpose is not to give loads of players a foil Jace the Mind Sculptor at 1/4 of its market value, it's just a treat for the store and the handful of per store who might be able to afford it. My local actually gave out one of their FTV:20's as top prize of Theros Pre-Release but they didn't have to, they used it as a way to draw in more customers. 
** WotC's primary customer is the stores, not you, because without the local stores providing the support to Wizards and the players *there is no more magic for anyone*. You are not being scammed. You are not entitled to own FTV:20 at an artificially low MSRP.
Right, but my point is mainly that in creating the "ease of access" that Hi-Rez is pushing for they are making it such that the more experienced players who have better awareness, mechanics, and knowledge are loosing their benefits as they create easy gods and hand holding devices.  Let's take for example the ward pinging.  Prior to that you actually had to keep an eye on the mini-map to know if someone was crossing a ward, or rely on your team to let you know.  Now the game is like "hey hey hey there is someone on their way back off!"  I will not even discuss the last 2 gods that they released as that is several pages of ranting.
TLDR - bring skill and mechanics back to smite!
Isn't that much traffic going to help create perverse incentives for teammates to, you know, "disrupt" potential packs of folks?  I know positioning matters less in NASCAR given the extreme levels of race randomness, but still worth fighting for position.  Certainly some gamesmanship when cars are released in F1 qualifying, but there's a bit more room for cars to spread out for flying laps.  
could be messy - a lot harder to prove blocking/getting loose in nascar, right?
For me personally, I think one of the bigger issues at play here is the fact the the actual Christianity subrredit has no longer become a place for non-Christians to find out what being a Christian is truly about.
Now this subbreddit has become more of a place for them to find out, the issue is is that when I first joined the sub, it was primarily Christians helping Christians and sup[porting Christians. When we had debates it was safe in the knowledge that we where all believers, there was no ill blood, but more playful discussion.
The other issue, is that when someone asks for help or prayer and a non-Christian comes and says  "hey do this" it's often in the right place, but they jsut don't get it as they are not a Christian. Sometimes Christians need support from other Christians, and when I go into a topic and see conservative views being down voted by the non-Christian members it breaks my heart.
This is obvious when most of the top up votes comments in this topic are non-christians!
SO overall I would agree with your TLDR - and also this sub needs to decide what direction it's going in. Do you want it to be a Christian teaching sub or a Christian safe haven. Maybe even have topic headers or something to indicate this?
Sorry for the late reply. was out of town for the weekend. 
there are two ways to look at it
1) effective HP (eHP) per hit
2) eHP per encounter
the first one is easier to calculate. it's the amount of damage you can receive in a small time frame. usually a single blow, but really any damage within a GCD. or more correctly any damage within your healers reaction time (including the time it takes to cast the spell). 
while I am a big proponent of healers actively, instead of re-actively, healing I understand that not every healer is capable of this. 
it boils down to this: you start to run into problems when your eHP is lower than what your healer can react to. IE: say you get hit  by death sentence and an auto-attack and take ~7k raw damage and you have 6400 HP as a pld. you only take 5600 damage (shield oath) and you have about 800 hp left. you're still alive, but if your healer cannot react in time to get you above the next AA threshold you will die. this is why eHP is just as important as raw mitigation. in a single GCD, your healer might hit you for ~2200 HP. which means you now have 3000 health. for the next hit you take, your eHP is now 3600 (again, shield oath). now, if you add 18 VIT to this, you gain about 80 hp. so you now have 3696 eHP for the next hit you take. it's easy to see where your gains are, and more important WHAT they are. 
increases a parry tier, your eHP increases based on the amount of damage you receive. the more you recieve the better your gains. lets assume increasing a parry tier improves your blocked damage  by 1%. let's also assume that parry is calculated before any other damage reduction modifiers (such as shield oath). it's not unheard of for mobs to hit you for upwards of 4k per hit. in a situation I mentioned earlier, you could be hit by twintania's AA and death sentence in a short time frame. so taking close to 7k damage within a single GCD isn't unheard of. but for now lets back off a bit and look at something more understood, like mountainbuster. which usually hits for around 4k damage. 
improving a parry tier will then mean you take ~40 less damage. 
And this is where that number comes from. if you are losing 80 HP, you are losing 80 eHP or 96 eHP if you are a pld. in order to get the same out of parry, you would need to be able to block that much more damage. but I specifically specified *between heals* because it is harder to quantify the parry gains over the course of a battle. namely because you cannot parry every attack. and furthermore parry has to actually activate for you to receive the benefit. 
Taking a look at one of my old logs, in a battle I received about 120k. Even assuming I parry every single blow I took, i would recieve 1200 less damage that fight if I improved a parry tier. Which is what...a cure 2 maybe? so one less cure 2 over the duration of the fight? Comparing to the amount of over heal I recieved (around 10k) improving a parry tier does almost nothing. 
This is why I always say that VIT/HP is better from a defensive perspective than str. my healer isn't going to notice 1 or even 2 less cure 2s. now, if it was 10 less cure 2s we might have something. but with a 1% gain, you're looking at (assuming 2200 per cure 2) having to take 2 *million* damage in an encounter. 
 your healer isn't going to notice you improving a parry tier. you will need a very very long fight and need to take a lot of damage for it to matter. this is again why I say, you don't really need to worry about STR outside of what you get naturally as you progress. This is also the reason I would never give up VIT for STR in the hardest content. eHP is one of the most important stats as a tank. It's not something i'm willing to give up. 


I have always preferred HP to any other stat on a tank. like most classes get VIT as the iLvl increases, tanks get str. so I strongly feel that we don't need more str beyond what we naturally obtain through gear. 
The reason I say this is because of how margin of error works for tanks. we are primarily reliant on healers. just like DPS classes rely on CDs to improve their margin of error on damage, tanks use them to increase margin of error while tanking. IE: using IB/rampart at the right time can give the healer one or even two more GCDs to react. 
While I am a strong advocate of healers being active, as opposed to reactive, you rarely encounter these kinds of players outside of hardcore raiders. so while ~80hp may not seem like a lot, I can't count the number of times i've taken an unexpected crit after a big attack and had less than 100hp remaining. giving me and my healer that one GCD needed to prevent a wipe. 
you may argue this is a fringe case,  but what does strength really give you? increased DPS? ok. how much? .5%? maybe 1%? and as a tank i might account for 8% of the total damage? meaning I might be improving overall DPS of the raide by .4%? damage is damage, sure. but in the grand scheme of things that .4% increase in damage isn't going to prevent a wipe. I drop below 100HP FAR more often than I'm the last man standing and miraculously deal the killing blow saving the raid.  
The other side of that is enmity. with the changes to defiance/shield oath i haven't had any enmity issues at all. even in turn 4, which is imo the most demanding for snap-threat, i don't have issues. the tanks I do see having issues are not using abilities appropriately (Flash on war instead of overpower/steel cyclone. etc.)
In such cases, even 18 str probably isn't goign to do much. instead i'd  be bringing in a STR pot. which gives me a big boost of str right when i need it. While I also carry hi-elixers for emergencies i rarely use them. so STR pots seem a much better alternative than to giving up raw HP. 
 there's no need to change your stats. depending on what you mean  by 'scenarios where more str would be nice' a STR pot may be more than sufficient to handle these. overall, more HP (even as little as 81 hp) will give you more margin for error than the minor increases STR will give you. 
Depends on the type of wood-glue used. There are potentially toxic formulas such as urea-formaldehyde resin which can degrade over time in the presence of heat and moisture. This would not be safe to use for something like a cutting board which is often subjected to such conditions as heat and moisture. 
Non-toxic solutions like the epoxy formula used by [Titebond]( are much more resistant to heat and moisture. Not all epoxy wood-glue is safe to use for an application like this, but the specific Titebond product I linked to is rated safe for indirect contact with food by the FDA. Provided the cutting board is washed gently in the sink using regular dish-washing soap and cool/warm water is will last for, potentially, years. There are some "non-toxic" wood-glue formulations that could potentially become toxic if subjected to high heat or other harsh conditions. Thus, avoiding the dishwasher or contact with various solvents (i.e. ethanol, acetone, or similar) is a must. Acids like vinegar or those found in fruits/vegetable could also potentially break down the wood-glue if left to sit for extended periods of time, so the board should be washed soon after use. 
Wood by itself is a mixture of two major ingredients: simple sugars (glucose) linked together in long chains to form cellulose, and also lignin, which is a complex of linked aromatic alcohols. Both of these types of molecules are polymeric in nature, meaning they are comprised of a specific ratio of various smaller compounds. Wood-glue is also a polymeric formulation meant to mimic the structural qualities of naturally produced wood polymers. These glue polymers can be synthetic, i.e. cyanoacrylate, or naturally derived, i.e. [animal glue]( either way, they tend to be stronger than the polymers found naturally in wood.
Glue becomes toxic when it degrades into the simpler components of its polymeric structure. The urea-formaldehyde resin I mentioned earlier is composed of urea and formaldehyde molecules arranged in a specific pattern which is not readily toxic. However, when this polymeric structure begins to break down into its component parts, the carcinogenic properties of pure formaldehyde become apparent.
**** Non-toxic wood-glue approved by the FDA is safe to use for an application like this provided the cutting board is taken care of by gently washing it soon after every use and avoiding the dishwasher. 
Maybe, just MAYBE because each of the referenced authors are conservative and have conservative ideologies?  Even McCorky stated that they KNEW that there were no jobs in the rural areas, they KNEW that the rural areas were going to get hit very hard with the lack of extended unemployment benefits -- but they went ahead and did it anyway.  ANY report that says the new jobs here in NC are not inferior to those manufacturing jobs that were lost has not one real-world clue as to what it's like in the unemployment line.  But like I said, it's okay, NC will flounder for a long time -- because WHAT company in it's right mind would want to move here with the tax, education, unemployment, and religious zealot type of state government we presently have?  Name one fresh start-up company that is willing to move to the triangle or Raleigh...  The state that limited ISP growth / internet sppeds wants to attract high-end companies?  Not in your internet lifetime.  But you keep on posting these conservative reviews, don't bother to research / explore and define it...  And by golly, gee, George, you'll continue to get downvoted.  Think of it as one of your professors telling you that you're on the wrong path for your thesis, but you continue anyway.    Waste of everyone's time.  P.S. Pray that you're never unemployed, disabled and/or considered "too old" to work.  
Now this author's bio just made me laugh out loud, and you call this a "solid piece of research" -- "a more scientific approach to ascertaining the truth behind the effectiveness of NC's reduction in employment benefits" --
THIS AUTHOR IS A a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. I am a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research and New York University. My research focuses broadly on macroeconomics. I am particularly interested in household finance, default and labor markets.
Maybe you could find SOMEONE who actually has a degree, worked in the economic's field before stating that it's "scientific and qualified" research?

I'm a collector as well, though I don't buy much anymore. I think they're worth it in the sense that I like original issues because they have more context. Cover art, letter columns, introduction, hell even advertising. They put the work in it's time and place.
A quick review of ebay will show you that the issues can be had for next to nothing. For preference, get the Double Diamond issues instead of the Antarctic Press reprints. They don't cost much more. I collected them years ago. Like, before ebay years ago. Like old issues of, say, Usagi Yojimbo, they weren't worth much, but good luck finding them digging bins. And I had access to many comic shops.
IMHO, Hepcats is an important work of anthropomorphics. There was a whole tide of "funny animal" work in the mid to late eighties, and very little of it was more than mediocre and derivative. Hepcats, with it's serious story line and (IMHO) amazing art, proved that serious work (with a contemporary, non SF story) could be done in an anthropomorphic format. 
This is already too long, but one interesting thing about Hepcats is that the anthropomorphics *don't matter*. The characters are not aware that they have the heads of various animals, and their bodies are completely human.
Yes you should.
Run a disadvantage arguing that condom distribution will anger the conservatives.  Variety of impacts:  equals increased conservative political power or better argue that when conservatives get mad they withdraw their kids from school.  (See Texas).  The children of non conservatives get condoms but conservative children actually get pregnant STDs at higher rate.  Then you win because impact of more ignorance. 
Poseidansdick has great arguments.  I think CTROs arguments might be easily turnable but check out the links anyway.
   increase condoms anger conservatives.
I too would really like some more in depth clarification. I haven't been able to find anyone who knows how the body chooses specifically from where triglycerides are converted to energy. Asking different doctors only gives me different answers, which is frustrating. 
Here is my crude understanding from reading some online texts.
When your body needs energy, it goes through 2 layers of energy before your body starts using triglycerides from fat cells. ATP-PC is super readily available energy that is depleted after only a few seconds of intense exercise. The second "tank" is glucose from carbohydrates. It can be depleted after a few minutes of intense exercise, this is when you are completely worn out after a mile run or something. Finally, the third tank which over short periods of time refuels the first two tanks comes from fat cells, this is when actual adipose tissue is used as fuel. It is my (very crude) understanding that if we don't allow the first two tanks to deplete, by constantly refueling with carbs, our adipose tissue isn't ever utilized, and fat only very slowly is drained, and if we eat too much, fat is stored. 
Now I think(?) in order to redistribute fat efficiently, we need to diet so that adipose tissue is used as fuel, and also eat to gain weight so that adipose tissue is added. If you are only dieting over long periods of time, adipose tissue is never added, so, supposedly, hormones will tell the body (this is the part I have poor understanding of) where to take adipose tissue from to use as fuel. My guess is that hormones somehow "prioritize" which fat cells are more important and crucial to life, and uses the least prioritized fat first. If you are on E, the male pattern fats will be the least prioritized, and should be used for energy first before the female patterned fat, which your body considers much more crucial now. 
OK OK TLDR for your questions: 
&gt;However... I'm worried about where this fat is going to come off. I'm reaching a critical time for fat redistribution, so I'm worried it'll come off my boobs, my hips, and other female fat deposits, and not off the male ones like my back and my belly.
Your body now considers these fats more crucial for life, so it should not come off once it stays. This fat is now the most stubborn fat to remove from your body as long as you maintain E levels
&gt;Also, if I'm not taking in a great deal of calories for a while, will this hinder my female fat redistribution and cause me to have a lesser end result?
Yes, in a sense, you won't build much new fat tissue, it won't hinder the "end result", it'll just take longer. The biological blueprint is there, it's just a matter of how long it takes to get there. The blueprint itself won't change.
I have heard consistently the best results from people who fluctuate weight within their healthy BMI range. If you lose  10lbs in a month, and gain 5 the next, you lost 10 lbs of male fat, and gained 5 lbs of female fat.   
Again, I have to stress this is my very crude understanding from online texts. It may be completely wrong, I'm not a biologist and not a doctor.
&gt;I like trimmed beards/completely shaven but I think that'll land me in the minority here.... it's very nice!
I am often the unpopular opinion puffin when a ladyboner posts a clean-shaven photo and a beardy photo and asks which is best. I am not a fan of long beards like a lot of the people here seem to be. 
 me too!
Alright, let me end the discussion as my opinion is the only one that matters in this entire conversation. I don't like Macklemore, so I will label him as pop as to slander his person.   
   
 FUCK WHAT YOU SAY. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. I'M RIGHT.
Uum the original greentext I've read was kinda the same, but the father actually lived with the son. Anon just always wondered how the father got exact games he wanted, and father replied: "Just luck I guess" and then when he died he came to his room and there were all these game magazines, with fun games marked up with notes like: "Maybe Anon will like this one?"
Don't ever believe for 100%, anything you read on 4chan
I didnt think the Lucasi cues on that price range came with a ld shaft. Almost every cue has a different feeling to it. There could be many reasons, ill briefly try to tackle a couple.
Joint pin - I do believe your new cue is a uniloc joint, and your old cue is a 5/16x18. The hit is going to feel different. The amount of energy that transfers through the joint can be different which would result in a different feel.
Deflection - Now your cue deflects less when applying spin. IT WILL STILL DEFLECT. You need to learn the amount when applying spin to the cueball. If you don't change how you aim from the action cue to the lucasi you will be off when shooting with english. You could be in your adjustment period and may have to be more aware of your aim point.
Hit - This is subjective, and can be debated for hours. Each cue has a different hit. Some people like soft, some hard, and some in between. It may take you a while to get used to a different hit, and that could be the feel you are speaking of.
Wrap - Shouldnt make much of a difference. It will dampen the hit some, but you should still feel it without a problem. From what I notice, its more of a personal preference. 
Miscuing - This is usually one of two things. Your mechanics or your tip. If your mechanics aren't the issue, then it would be the shape or type of tip you have. The fact of it being low deflection and sliding off the ball is a little bit overstated, and wouldn't effect this. This is assuming chalk isn't the offender.
TL,DR- Each cue has different characteristics that make it "it". Give it time to get used to it, and it will pay off. There is an adjustment period to a change to a LD shaft.
My problem with Chuuni wasn't the message, but I feel that the drama was a bit rushed at the end, ESPECIALLY in episode 10. Not 1 second after Yuuta and Rikka confess to each other big drama comes in. At least make it the next episode! Also, later in that episode we don't get to see what Yuuta said to Rikka to make her stop being chuuni, so it felt kinda lazy and rushed to me.
Chuunibyou is a good show, but I think it would've been even better if episode 10 was split into 2 full episodes.
Of course, this is just my personal opinion and you are very much free to have your own.
The only study I know of having to do with this observation only studied it when the two were mixed ( However, I doubt that it makes a difference when the milk is consumed. The proteins in milk (caseins) sequester the beneficial flavonoids and make it less bioavailable. I'd say if you're really concerned with it, wait a while before drinking milk.

The idea behind patterns is that there's certain ways of thinking and acting that we humans fall into. These things happen even in completely different problems. So we can find management patters in a team of 5, or a company of 10,000 and this is without even discussing what these groups want to do.
The patterns started with programming, but have slowly been creeping to other areas. In theory you could see them anywhere people have to think about how to do something.
Patterns where originally pushed as positive, things you want to do. The idea is that you could realize that a pattern applied to your situation and then you could use the collective wisdom from everyone who's used that pattern even if no one has ever dealt with your problem. But then some of these patterns where found to be bad ideas in general, they sound good, or seem attractive, but in reality leave you worse off than if you hadn't followed them at all. This began getting called anti-patterns.
An interesting thing is the following anti-pattern: putting the pattern before the horse. This is, patterns are not a magical solution, they appear in certain cases (and should appear naturally). The idea is that you should recognize patterns and anti-patterns within what you are doing and act accordingly (improving implementation and avoiding common mistakes, or trying to avoid the anti-pattern). Some people force the patterns, assuming that the more you add the better. I would say patterns are like salt, if you add what's needed towards the end you get something really good, if you add as much as you can at the beginning you'll finish with something inedible.
So in short (:
* Anti-patterns are always bad, basically they are common mistakes and bad practices.
* Patterns are really good when used correctly. They allow you to make parts of an unknown problem into a known problem.
* Trying to always use patterns, or forcing patterns to apply is an anti-pattern in itself.
* Patterns should arise naturally and be observed, forcing them stifles creativity and promotes over-thinking.
&gt; This could all be part of a cylon infiltration, but my intuition is that during all of his work with dna Dr. Hatake discovered the cylon half of our genetic code. I think he realizes that human beings are a sophisticated mix of at least two races and I think he wants to fully activate that cylon half and delete the human part in order to create a lifeform that is 100% cylon.
That's... that's even more amazing than the idea that the Cylons came back and started all this! I really hadn't thought about a scenario other than active Cylon infiltration, so this all happening because of human curiosity makes it even better, in my opinion, because it allows the series to be grounded on Earth rather than force the necessity of the return of the Centurion type of Cylons. That also means it doesn't stray into the whole FTL-drive spaceship-and-giant-killer-robots area that tends to turn a lot of people off of a science fiction television series for some reason completely alien to me.
A human discovers the Cylon DNA, wants to make it pure, ostensibly for the betterment of mankind (or even to weaponize), only to 'resurrect' (for lack of a better term) the pure-blooded Cylons. That's genius.
EDIT: And now I know how the show ends. (Or, more accurately, how I'd end it if this theory held.)
Thank you! the math in your comment took me longer to figure out than I care to admit.  can't do math 
Squirtle &gt; Wartortle &gt; Blastoise from Blue version back in the 90's. 
I went through a burglaring phase in early grade school (nothing malicious - just me being a greedy little misguided youth) anyway when my parents caught on not only did I  return everything and make apologies all around but most of the possessions that were rightfully mine (a la gameboy and games) were taken away by the parentals and donated to charity.
I'm sorry Blastoise. I failed you.
If you join team rocket, your parents take your own pokemon away for good

Nope. This is not feasible at this point.
You're talking about millions (likely around 5 million) of refugees all getting Israeli citizenship at once. We don't have the economy to support this. Almost no nation **on earth** has the economy to support such large scale immigration, even if only half of the Palestinians decide to immigrate. We experienced a housing crisis when the USSR broke up and hundreds of thousands (eventually over a million) immigrants arrived to the country. There were not enough jobs to support all of them, and for a while, their economic state was abysmal. **And this happened with Jewish immigrants**, a lot of them with higher education and good job experience.
If Palestinians are given the right of return, we would literally not have enough jobs, houses or goods to support them all. And i'm not even going to mention the racism they will face, from both the establishment and the Jewish Israeli society, as well as probably racism from their side to the Jewish one. All of this animosity, which **will** emerge from the economic conditions and the already rampant racism on both sides, will unravel the country and destroy lives.
Another thing i'm not mentioning- this won't jibe with the basic concept most Israelis have about Israel. The feeling is that we want a country **of our own**, we want to live in a Jewish state, not happen to be a bunch of Jews living in a Palestinian state.
 You want a happy marriage, but this relationship is already doomed. Let's just get a divorce.
1) as i said,the recent nature of their nationhood is not a valid reason to dismiss it   
2) "Palestinian" identity is not homogenious in the same way as any other nation is, like the Basques or the Catalans ,Welsh or Inuits.  In fact they have NO unique food, no unique music, no unique history before 1948 , and the "accent" claim is largely arguable as well and is,moreover not the same in Ramallah as in Gaza.  
3) the reason why i personally believe their nationhood claim is a sham (though,i again,this is my personal belief) is that it is evidently a product of 3rd party initiatives and meddling and was created expressly as an instrument in the cold war / panarabism power games in the 1950-1970s  
4) even assuming their nationhood is fake, that is not a reason to deny them nationhood...if they want to have their own state, let them...this has already been well accepted in principle by israeli majority..  
the argument currently is that the palestinians are demanding territorial consessions that would threaten security of the state of israel while having proved that they themselves are not in any form a permanent partner for any sort of long term agreement, what with there not even being single representative body .    
   
- the only reason they still dont have a state is because their leadership is made up of violent assholes like Arafat who were not willing to compromise reasonably
The only person who has really *hurt* the coven was Madison, no? Not including Fiona, because she's not in the running for the new supreme position. I don't see how Zoe hurt the coven, although I could see one arguing against Queenie.
it could be anyone. 
Hell fucking yea I would. Crickets have great macros and I've eaten them. Delicious.
 
 
Second link is nutrition profiles. Crickets are mainly protein.
I'm a Geography B.S. student, almost done with my degree. Bugs may be what your grand children get swole from. Many credible researchers are predicting massive food shortages in the future(for grain importers and a huge increase in food prices ( for everyone else). Also a lot of crop land is being used up by farming what will eventually turn into ethonal, this will increase with the push for non fossil fuels. Water will become scarce in many places soon making farming even less viable. World population is still skyrocketing. 
 Your grandkids might bulk off insects because grain prices are going to skyrocket, we feed animals we eat grain, this makes meat prices skyrocket. I'd rather eat crickets than soy. Yum.

I have a nasty auto-immune disease called lupus and take a whole cocktail of immune suppressants to help manage it. A few weeks ago my cat bit my wrist and by the next morning my whole arm was hugely swollen, red and hot. Went to the ER and by the time they got me in (a few hours later) I had red streaks going all the way up my arm. Had to be on I.V. antibiotics for 5 days and oral antibios for 10 days. After all that, it hasn't gone away and the infection is now most likely in my bones now as a bone infection (going in for tests soon). I'm going to a new doctor tomorrow and I hope to get started on new treatment.  The super fun bonus to all of this that I've had the WORST diarrhea from the antibiotics killing off my good gut flora despite the fact that I have been eating nothing but probiotics for days now and its just not getting better. Wish me luck that I don't end up loosing my arm!
 immune-suppressed so now a cat bite means I have a chance of loosing my arm.
I actually had a crazy experience trying to get this vinyl. This was actually a gift to my wife for Christmas. I could NOT find this record anywhere nor for a decent price (some listings out there have it for $100 and up!). I decided to not give up on it, regardless if it was a late present. I HAD to make it happen. After taking the advice from a user on /r/vinylcollectors, I called Reckless Records. They tell me that they do have a copy available but that the copy is on hold... And that they hold items for a week and that this vinyl has been on hold since December 16th. Keep in my I called in on the 18th of December. They agree to put me next on the list to buy it if the person who reserved it fails to pick it up. 
I anxiously call every other day during that week to know if it's been picked up and so far I'm looking good. The copy is still there. The 24th comes around, a whole week passes and I call anxiously to buy this record. They tell me that this record is actually on hold TILL the 26th! On the inside I'm infuriated because I was SO close but I kept my cool and waited. I call the 27th, first thing in the morning, and Reckless Records tells me it's been picked up. I felt defeated, I kinda even hated FKA Twigs over this ordeal (not seriously though). The 28th comes and I get a call from Reckless Records asking if I still wanted to purchase the album. I'm confused but I don't ask any questions and just give them all my payment info. Finally here it is and my wife is ecstatic. 
 you can accomplish anything if you're determined. 
So I bought a new 40 count herf-a-dor from the Devil Site and it came with a spiffy new 75 count humidification puck of the foam variety.  The Cbid folks were even so nice as to make sure the foam was occupied with an active mold colony for me.  Thankfully, it wasn't in the herf-a-dor, but in it's own sealed box and bag.
**- DON'T USE THE FOAM BOYS AND GIRLS!**
Not that terrible...Use Distilled Water only and once every other fill use propylene glycol solution.  I've monitored Humidors my whole life (been working at cigar shops since i was 7yrs old).  Very Rarely encountered any issues and they do have self regulating models that take some of the monitoring away. Granted if you are the type to forget to monitor and not be diligent they do have beads that work well.  These are cheap...cheap is usually not as easy.
there are newer things to use...but these are nowhere near terrible.  
I think outside of late-night comedy nobody mentioned her baby with Down Syndrome negatively in the political realm. And even then it was mentioned at most twice. I'm actually only aware of one joke, but surely there's another one out there somewhere.
Her daughter's pregnancy, however, was mentioned because Palin touts family value when she can't even get her own house in order. I think a lot of people (or Palin herself) conflated this particular attack her family together with the Down Syndrome baby joke because it made her seem more sympathetic.
EDIT - I think I know what you're referring to now. There was speculation that Palin claim that she's the mother of the newborn when it's actually her daughter's to cover up the her daughter's indiscretion. The baby happens to have Down Syndrome, which is a detail the media always mentioned for some reason. Nobody actually attacked her for having a baby with Down Syndrome. If anything the condition make the claim that it's actually her baby - and not her daughter's - more plausible since Down Syndrome is more prominent among babies of older women. She again also conflates this with an attack of her baby having Down Syndrome.
-  You're wrong.
If you haven't learned how to max characters yet (4/8+), I would stay away from purchasing any coins.
If you really wish to spend money, the starter pack ($20 and you might have to e-mail WildShadow support) or new character slots will probably improve your game play experience the most. After that point, I find that Dyes (to make my long-living characters more unique) make me want to keep playing. Vault spaces are always nice, but I personally find them too expensive for what they provide. This is just my opinion though.
Also pets stay in your pet yard after death. This question makes me think you're a new player. Avoid buying gold till you reach the end-game stage (maxing characters, doing tombs).
- I think the best gold items are character slots, dyes, and vault spaces (in that order). Try to avoid anything else.
It finally stopped, but my mom used to get me frogs. Frog garden ornaments, Christmas decorations, pictures, books, whatever. I was baffled by it holiday after holiday. I didn't know how to bring it up, but finally I couldn't take it anymore and asked her about it. I remember very vividly saying, "Thanks so much for the frog planter, its really cute, but I have to ask, do you think I like frogs?" She told me she knew I was collecting them. I told her I had only been collecting them since she started buying them for me. Then she insisted that I had always like them, and reminded me that I had pet frogs the first year we had lived in her new house. I pointed out that I lived in Mexico that year, and she said "oh yeah, it was your sister who liked frogs. Oh well, I guess you are collecting them now."
 my mom inadvertantly started my frog collection because she forgot that it was my sister who liked frogs. 
So he didn't allow you to use his copyrighted material in your video (he told you you would have to pay for it) but you used it anyway without permission?
That is copyright infringement.  Sure, that guy infringed on the original artist, but his infringement doesn't give you the right to infringe.  When someone creates a derivative work (modifying another song or copyrighted work and creating a new work) that person owns a copyright in that derivative work.  They don't own the original, but they do own the work they added to it.
So in shorthand:
Artist A creates work.  Guy B, creates a work and tells you (C) you need to license it.  If C doesn't pay B (which he told you you needed to), B can sue C for infringement.  However, A can still sue B for infringement, and C for that matter.  Even if A sues B, B still has a claim against C.
 you did infringe, move on.
I've noticed the difference too. I think most people are pretty smart they just might not be good at the typical "smart" things, such as math. 
As for blue collar guys being different in groups, I believe they just do it to fit in and avoid being made fun of. I've met people who can figure things out on their own, but are hesitant to do so because of a fear of being wrong.
people are good at different things and stick to their comfort zone
In those days, news took days to travel. Now everyone can see live how f'ed up situation on live television. 
Outside of /r/India and few social media activist, no one knows and cares about whats going on. 
How many of % your FB friends posts political status? Its like those 5-10% people who are active, and those are the people who makes difference at the end of the day. 
Pro BJP will vote for BJP
Pro Congressi will vote for Congress
Anti BJP will vote for Congress or regional parties.

Eh, I genuinely think that it has less to do with being weak-willed and more to do with issues that were not really relevant prior to the advancement of technology and the abundance of resources that we have now in modern western society (food, specifically).
People always had the ability to be huge fatasses if they had the resources to reach that point, which for a long time we really didn't, as a society. Food was seen as fuel for the day, not something that is mostly always around.
I don't buy into the weak-willed stuff. You either care about your appearance or you don't, those who do fall into three categories and those who don't well, generally only fall into one.
Care: Are healthy, or aren't healthy and don't know how to resolve it (genuinely have no idea how to diet), or aren't healthy and have no ability to stop it (depression, other psychological diseases, compulsion, and so on).
Don't care: You really only get mentally ill here. If you genuinely don't give a shit about your health *at all*, huge issues.
The people who would lose a bunch of weight in a structured environment and then gain it back, most likely fall into the latter of the three under 'Care' - most likely compulsion.
Eating stuff to them is like smoking a cigarette or checking their email or biting their nails or throwing up (for some people, anyway). Its something that they know they must not do consciously, but the urge is strong.
It really is exactly like craving a cigarette, good analogy me. Being that I have a few compulsive issues, I can relate a little.
Now, nobody should think people are any worse for having these issues, I mean they're just people with problems and the harm falls on them, there's just no reason to.
The main issue is with tumblrinas who advocate this lifestyle and who respond aggressively to criticism, while advocating their culture of unhealthy activity. That is messed up and can potentially harm others, some who may have lost hope.
*** I guess the point is that there's no use on picking on the tubby, these bitches are toxic though.
This is the option I find myself having to take. Even this is hard to attain. The cheapest gun I can find is $1000, and requires a firearms license, and a level on top of that. Then you need to buy ammo. Need to wait for it to arrive, need to avoid suspicion if you live at home like me. 
I have a severe phobia of needles, and I can't handle blood and pain, so knives and the like are out of the question. I've tried asphyxiation but cannot handle it, drowning is the same. I've looked into cyanide capsule which I have no idea to attain but can't comprehend the burning, i suffer from reflux and thats bad enough for me. I've even considered, and I know it is mad, trying to get others to kill me. For instance, death by firing squad, provoking a gang member(few around these parts), or getting a death penalty. The reason I haven't done those are because instead of death I could be disfigured, instead of a gun the gang member could pull a knife, the firing squad could just get me in a limb and then i go to jail for a long time and suffer more, or I don't get death penalty and get a life sentence instead. I've also considered explosives, that to me screams accidentally blowing off your limbs and not being able to convince someone to turn life support off for you. I've also considered signing up for military in hopes of death on the battlefield, but there's no wars going on, so it's just a bunch of guys out-manliness-ing each other and verbal abuse.
I planned on jumping off a building for the longest time, and still do, ironically, the tallest building near me is a hospital, but it seemed to work for a doctor that jumped off, the problem there is that increased security. I don't exactly want to go out in a mess either or traumatize some kid walking past or something. 

This not the only route I have taken. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression, and kept it hidden for a very very long time because when it started developing the whole emo thing was starting up so yeah. I inquired with different doctors who thought I was silly. I don't do drugs. Don't drink. I looked up local chatrooms online, there are none. There are very very few support groups for either, none of them are in my city. I've barely got a relationship with my parents so they couldn't help. I've been to different therapists etc for a few years now, they all get sick of me because I struggle to tell them anything. I've been on different meds for a few years, and bigger doses. I've reached out to friends that couldn't care less. 
I tried talking to my long term girlfriend about it many times and was dumped recently because she can't handle my mental health(even though her family is the most clusterfuck of sick people you have ever seen) and she thought I was projecting my issues onto her which I really really wasn't, I've tried exercise many many many times in many forms and fail fucking miserably making me feel worse than originally, as an atheist I have no religious comfort..
And it got so bad last night that I tried every single helpline available in my country, keep in mind i'm terrified to talk to people on the phone, I got no response until around 3:30am, I was then put on hold until past 4am, the woman on the line was TERRIBLE and made me feel so awful, she had my details btw since they work with people I've seen before, she criticized everything I said, she got annoyed when I couldn't talk from trying not to break down, or when I swore out of sheer frustration with everything, she then threatened me with an ambulance no matter what i did, so i hung up, she sent 2 police cars over, now all of my neighbors(including several people i know as friends of sorts) all know about it, so ultimately worse than i was before.
Guns are the only answer for some and I would fucking love one
It's alot of older players, and it's actually pretty interesting from a sociatal stand point how all of this went down. Pretty much he started the reignofgaming site, which consisted of a few tier lists. These tier list were the first real guide lines to non pro players on what to play and how strong it was. People acted like these tier lists were the bible and it ended up being a HUGE detriment to the league community. It gave people a reason to be toxic, and because a pro stood behind it there was a huge circlejerk if you picked anything considered low tier, playing then was infuriating. People really disliked him for it and bashed him REALLY hard. Like people have killed themselves over some of the things people were telling him, it got pretty out of hand. So he went on tilt (I'm assuming now) as he is an emotional guy and got kicked from team after team. Now people hate him just to hate him, kinda like teemo, and he rages alot but that has more to do with actual trolls who are actively trying to lose games they're in with him. And that's where we are now.
Elementz greatest contribution to the LOL community (the reign of gaming site) was also indirectly the cause of his collapse as a pro player.
Is he still considered a professional? I'm genuinely curious about this. He was a professional player at one point in time, but now he isn't good enough to play for a professional team (at least in terms of LCS and such since he isn't on a team anymore), so is he still considered a professional? Or is it more like he WAS a professional LoL player?
Are people considered professionals forever if they make it to the "pros" for at least 1 season or something? Or are people only considered pro's as long as they are in the professional leagues?
Sorry for somewhat repeating myself, but yea...
TL:DR- Is elementz still considered a professional because he was a pro at one point? Or no because he isn't playing at a professional level anymore?
I've watched every game he has played since the World Cup. Since the transfer he has played better than I expected. He has integrated more of the way he plays for the German NT and is *trying* to figure out how to play more defensively, which has always been his greatest weakness. He hasn't had a dip in form from my perspective. I'll quote myself from 2 months ago...
&gt;And I'll just go ahead and predict that someone will say he has 'disappeared' in 90% of the games he plays for the rest of the season.
All the complaints about him in here mirror the exact complaints about him at Madrid. It's unsurprising when many were expecting a highlight reel spectacle in every game. That was never going to happen. And it won't even happen once he 'settles in'. He already looks way more comfortable than I thought he would. He's a team-player and won't thrill you guys the way you want him to without the rest of the team being on the same page.
I've been spoiled, as I expected far more immediate frustration with the PL (which I'm new to watching because of Özil). I still don't think things will truly take shape for a season or two with money available and potential future signings. I don't think you guys should worry that Özil regrets his move. I haven't seen him play with this much enthusiasm in years. He's happy.
**- Above average.**
My fiancee is Russian, so I always play a little sub game when I meet Catherine: Be friends forever.
It's really difficult for me, as I play wider than anything, and Russia always ends up coveting my lands and wonders. 
In my current game, I started on a continent right beside Catherine, with 3 other civs. We took out Rome together, but she denounced me as soon as I took his capital, cuz she must have coveted it. I wipe out and take over all the other civs across the continent, enveloping her almost entirely. I have citadels at all the mountain choke points, and armies galore keeping the border peace.
We've never been at war once, but she's been sitting n her Little mountain cage alternately begging for luxuries and denouncing me for trapping her in the relationship. So it's basically a mirror of my actual relationship.
 Catherine is my fiancee IRL
This reminds me of a time when, many years ago, I regularly parked my car across the street in front of the place I was renting.  I had to do so because of reasons. Anyway, one day the guy across the street uses some hot asphalt to make a shitty (and illegal) ramp so he can get his car up onto his front lawn.
 He already had one driveway. 
He proceeds to inform me that I can't park on the street anymore because "it's his driveway now, and it's illegal to block a driveway."
So, before I was born, my dad used to work for the city planning department. He knows his shit about zoning and permitting and all that red-tape. So I ask my dad, "what does the code of our fair city have to say about arbitrary driveway declarations?"
My dad informs me that one needs to obtain the city's blessing, which is expressed in a form known as the "curb-cut permit," if one wishes to do such a thing.  So I ask the asphalt-pourer if he's gotten a curb-cut permit.  
"No," he says, "I need to park my car on my lawn so it's my driveway now." 
[His attitude when.]( 
Well, it was a huge pain in the ass for me to park my car anywhere else because of reasons. It was entirely legal for me to park on the street as I did, since I moved the car at least once every 24 hours. 
So, one night I got drunk, and (at about 2AM on a sunday IIRC) took a sledgehammer to that bastard's sorry excuse for a driveway: just whalloped the living shit out of that pathetic asphalt ramp. In the space of five minutes I had scattered it all to hell and back. 
Fuck that guy. If he'd gotten the permit, I would have said, "fine, I'll park up the street." Due to the high density of rental homes on that street, each spilling over with slackers and their tatty vehicles, it would have been about 200 yards up the street, though. 
*** Some asshole declares 10 feet of curb his "driveway" and makes an illegal asphalt ramp; I get drunk and fuck the ramp's shit up with a sledgehammer. 
**Edit:** He already had one driveway, but he felt like he needed two. 
Let's break this down.
*You* gave a group of *fact-based statements.*
*You* edited your post to add
&gt; Edit: uh oh, Here comes the fucking loser console fan boys. Bring on the down votes for an opinion.
*I* called your bullshit out on self-labeling your post as "opinion", when instead, it is composed of *fact-based statements.*
Don't try to shield your fact-based statements with a label of "opinion" when it is clearly not.
Also: This is where I hop off the crazy train. It cannot possibly be explained to you any clearer.
[Jaja, la casa es enfermo de muerte pues biblioteca garza perro con quesa las ropas Ramirez.] (

Oh, I agree. I think Aldo vs Pettis is a compelling matchup, and probably the only superfight we'd actually get to see if Aldo gets to bulk up a tad. All other superfights are more fantasy or less interesting, but these two guys could/will probably become one of the best trilogies in history if their first two bouts are as competitive as I imagine they will be.  I'm fucking psyched for Aldo vs Pettis. 
While I agree, OP seems to be going for the low hanging fruit making fun of the people who argue the most extreme and idiotic versions of these arguments. While there are people who argue for the most extreme versions of these statements, I think there are plenty of non virgin, non sheltered, adults who could intelligently argue the underlying sentiments behind the two issues. Such as "you should try to be financially stable before you have kids" or "regardless of the attackers gender you have a right to self defense."
 It's easy to shit on these ideas when articulated so poorly.
Thankfully my Moose doesn't eat too much.  Well, he's not supposed to be anyways.  He pretends he is starving, and my roommate believes him, so in Tolkein fashion he has had his share of second breakfast/dinner along with elevensies etc.
It can be super cheap, if you're willing to invest your time into it.  Many people in town I know put ads in the online classifieds/facebook etc asking for people's old freezer burnt meat for free or super cheap.  And then make their own raw food with the free meat and organs/bones from butcher's shops etc.
Me?  I'm super lazy.  And usually busy.  And really, I have no desire to make my own raw food right now.  Perhaps when I add another dog to my family, the extra food consumption will lead me to make my own food.  But in the mean time, I buy either [Pets Go Raw!]( or [Nature's Variety Instinct](  Personally, I find Pets Go Raw! to be a little better, but they're pretty on par price wise.  Natures Instinct offers a little more convenience in that they offer 1oz medallion sizes so I don't need to bother cutting and measuring patties.
The cost is indeed more than kibble, but not necessarily more than wet food costs.  Also, the health benefits from feeding raw mean that you're less likely to run into costly veterinary visits down the road.  Their teeth stay cleaner from the bones, and their kidney functions are better because of the high moisture content of the food, and the lack of grain improves their digestive/bowel health.
[Here is a link from a veterinarian on the benefits of raw, along with a recipe for making your own at home!](
  For my moderately active, indoor 14 lbs cat, I feed him a 1/4lbs of raw food everyday.  I average around $50 a month to feed him raw food (this includes supplemental food like chicken necks and freeze dried liver treats) And once a month his food is free because of their buy 10 get 1 free rewards program.

We planned our baby to be here when we got married May 2014 but after I got pregnant a bunch of kinks were thrown into the monkey works to actually get married at the time/date/location we picked. We ended up doing a civil ceremony and then the wedding a month later (I had one day of panic before saying fuck it let's get married in three months) and I gotta say- getting married before the wedding is the best thing anyone could ever do, because no matter what, at the end of your wedding day, you're already married! So its not a big deal if things go wrong.
Anyway the is go for the Vegas wedding! Or even a courthouse one! And then plan a big wedding if that's what you want :D
I've had some trouble with the XFX 280x's overheating. I have two of them in a case. You might not have the same issues if you have it set up in the open. 
On my cards something called vrm temperature get above 110 Celcius. When that happens the cards throttle down to 60% load until the temperature goes down. All in all this leads to the average hashrate being about 1100-1200 KHs, while on full load 100% of the time it would be about 1390 KHs.
I've solved this by removing the side cover on my case and having a table fan constantly blow at the cards. It can be quite noisy, but if you're not in the same room it doesn't matter. I'm pretty much either at work or sleeping these days, so it doesn't matter to me if it's a bit noisy in my livingroom. 
 Much temperature. So throttle. Such fan. Many cooling. 
Honestly I can't really see the difference between a 120hz monitor and a monitor with a lesser refresh rate, The Asus has a refresh rate of 56-76 Hz but honestly I have 3 of them and I personally find them amazing for gaming etc... Increasing your refresh rate allows more states (of color) to be on the screen each second. However, with this specific monitor since the response time is so low it only takes 1 ms for the color to change on your screen, resulting in extremely smooth image quality ;D 
 Stick with this monitor
They don't want to explain it. There was an [article]( about "anti-racism dog" (a twitter account that replied "woof woof woof" to posts that its operator considered racist for whatever reason) a few years back.
&gt; Colour-blind racists feed on good-faith debate, and engaging with them, especially online, is almost always futile. But when they’re barked at by a dog, one whose only quality is anti-racism, they flip the fuck out. They demand to be engaged in debate (‘Tell me how what I said was racist!’) or appeal to objective definitions (‘The dictionary says racist means X, therefore nothing I said was racist’), but @Anti_Racism_Dog just barks.
 accuse someone of being racist/sexist without bothering to defend your position, if they challenge your accusation this somehow proves the accusation.
I think what people in this thread aren't realising is we are buffing/nerfing the weapons *against the most used weapons*. We aren't just buffing them, and saying "It's fine, now people will use it!" we need to be buffing them so people say 'Oh man, that might be more fun/better now/as good as X" The fact of the matter is people aren't going to use an inferior weapon just because it got it's own buff.
What do i mean? Let's take the third degree. No downsides, and hurts heal target/medic as well. A perfectly good weapon for flanking/ambushing. Logically there is no reason not to use it, as those complete both of Pyros main functions perfectly. Until we look at his other weapons. The third degree is a great choice for her, but only when not compared to other weapons, in which case it falls short (For example, the axtinguisher can do more damage than it in a quicker amount of time to two targets, the powerjack can get you out of a tight spot/better flank, the home wrecker can help protect your base, etc). So how do we 'balance' the weapon?
It's pretty simple. If you increase the attack range of the third degree, you gain additional flanking ability, at the cost of the burst damage of the backscratcher/axtinguisher. If we add in an effect such as 1.5x damage against a pocket while attacking a medic (if you attack the medic the pocket takes more damage), we have the burst damage outweighed. of course it needs a down side, which could be anything from 10% less damage on non-healing targets, no random crits, or a slower swing speed. none of these impede it's function, but at the same time make you think "maybe i shouldn't use this over this". Another good option would be keeping the same stats and adding in the ability to remove sappers, with a penalty to match (As to not over throw the homewrecker)
A really really good example of this is the backscratcher. The main options for a pyro's melee are Powerjack, axtinguisher, and homewrecker. The powerjack is used for either the speed or the extra health without a medic, while the axt is used for better burst damage while flanking. The backscratcher is the perfect middle ground, since it accomplishes the extra health and has increased damage for flanking, without usurping the other two from their viability.
 Buffing weapons is not just a matter of making something better, it's a matter of making something equal
Oh my heck, all the time! When I was younger I went to an arcade with my family. I was enjoying myself, going around, some guy comes up to me and says "I know you and I don't remember how." Squick. So I try to be nice, say no, I doubt it. Try to discreetly get away from him. He starts following me around the arcade. He starts saying stuff like, "I used to date you. I can't believe you don't remember." Yeah. No. I was all of 14ish, pretty sure I'd remember going out with this guy, because it would have been a nippy day in hell. So I go to my dad, who is a big burly guy, hoping to scare this creep off. He introduces himself as an old friend of mine, which he absolutely was not. Ruined that day.
Then a couple years ago I was in a bookstore browsing while I tried to get the guts to apply. Started getting that vibe from a guy nearby, so I moved down the aisles casually as you please, sci-fi, then fantasy, then horror. He follows. Okay, maybe he just likes the same things I do. I go to the romance section. He still follows. Hard-core erotica? What a coincidence, me too! (I imagine that's what he thought at least.) Luckily, that was the day I was again having daddy-daughter time, so when he got there I stuck to him like glue and the guy disappeared.
 Creeps follow me around when I'm alone in public. So I don't stay alone for long if I can help it.
I JUST saw a psychiatrist for the very first time ever this very morning. So I'm probably as close to your situation (while being one step ahead of you) as humanly possible right now.
He didn't even hesitate to get started, he was instantly asking me how I am feeling, etc, what I felt brought me in. The thing though, is that he was by far the easiest person to talk to about my problems I've ever had in my life. I do NOT open up to people around me or even close to me. But he actually felt like he was there to listen *thoroughly* and relate to a degree. Not relate as in he seemed depressed, but in that when I would be trying to find the words to say or how to describe something, many times he could figure it out and would ask if I meant it a certain way, and he was always dead on. 
He also asked me to describe things more in depth if I would sort of blow over something, and I actually started to realize some of the core problems I was having. Sort of like if I was in a canoe and a giant wave hit me, instead of focusing on the wave, we were looking at what caused it. If that makes sense. It very helpful and I left feeling proud of myself and a little more upbeat than I have been.
There was also a fun mini-I.Q. test, I was also being tested for anxiety though, so it made me a little anxious to sit down and feel like I was in a testing situation, but there were no time limits, no wrong answers, and I could just sit there and zone out for however long I needed before continuing, it was nice.
 I just saw a psychiatrist today, it was one of the most beneficial things I've ever done. You'll be happy to have done it, even if you're terrified now like I was beforehand too.
I did cold calling up until last year.  Got a few hnw and uhnw clients from it.  One with $15mm in free cash flow.  This method only works in this order:
1.  Define a target market (I chose wall st)
2.  Gather or buy only qualified leads in this market (I'll explain how you can evaluate later. Only buy ppls direct numbers. Main lines are a waste of time)
3.  Define your script. (Keep it short.  Goal of these cold calls is not to sell a product but to schedule a 15 min follow up call/webinar.  You should be on and off the phone in 2 min maximum. Pitch delivered and time booked.)
4.  This is a numbers game so get used to rejection.  If you have a fear of rejection or 'call reluctance' just keep plugging away.  You will become a master at this and a pretty good negotiator.  At my peak I was calling 200ppl per day. 
4a.  Make a game out of it.  My best day ever I booked 10 appointments in 1 hr.  I had only called 60ppl for that day.  So I went out with my work buddies and got sloshed at lunch. It was great.  (200 calls can be daunting but it does work.  There will be days were you will dial 300ppl and you will not book 1 appointment. You will be cursed at and hung up on. You must celebrate the tiny victories.)
4b.  For your own sanity change your script every couple of weeks. 
You will probably ask, "if you were so good at it why did you leave?"  My boss and work environment were great.  I ultimately left my job for 2 reasons, I felt that I was not getting paid for the work that I did and I was not learning the basics of fin planning.  I was receiving 30% of every case I dragged in, while my mentor took home 70%.   Under the guise of starting my own business, I was not learning the art of selling financial services, but being churned for a profit by someone else. 
The strange part is I work as financial planner at another firm now, for the top producer in the country.  (He gets 100% of his leads from referrals.)  I hate working for someone else. Working my ass off for pennies (I am making more money now) to line someone else's pockets.  Listening to abusive, hostile managers all day.  I would go back to cold calling in a second to gain that freedom I had.  
cold calling works.  Just be prepared to stick with it.  Working for someone else in finance sucks. 
Edit:  I am a Financial Planner. Studied professional sales in college
Well, Rule #1 is not rooted in gameplay so much as it is in members' verbal interactions with one another. For a more gray-area example, I might hate being killed across the map by snipers who sit on rooftops all day, but they're not being inconsiderate of me by doing something that I don't like. A more relevant example is players who purposefully ram enemy helis/jets. Is it "inconsiderate" because it's a "cheap" and "unsportsmanlike" action? Perhaps a little bit, but it's part of the game as it was meant to be implemented by DICE, so we shy away from making rules against it as it would be against PURE's ideal of not enforcing custom rulesets.
Also, enforcement would be difficult. At what point is someone camping an enemy spawn? To be fair, the rule would need to have some quantifiable line beyond which it can be considered "broken" by a player, and that line is hard to draw without being completely arbitrary. Is someone sitting at the E flag on Seige with a Stinger breaking the rule? How about on top of the buildings near E on the side of the enemy spawn? How about on top of the buildings halfway to the D flag? Should the line be drawn instead based on the number of rockets fired? If the line beyond which rule-breaking occurs is instead drawn on a case-by-case basis, that would go against the Admin Team's commitment to objectivity, and thereby wouldn't align with PURE's ideals either.
BF4 is all about hurting and inconveniencing your enemy in the interest of winning the game. You hide SLAMs in "cheap" places to blow up tanks, you use "no-skill" lockon weapons to take down air, and so on, all to help your team maintain land or air dominance and control. Some tactics are cheaper than others, but in this case, camping the enemy spawn with a stinger squad is a ridiculously effective way of keeping their helis out of the battle. Would I do it? Probably not, because--along with actions like ramming air vehicles on purpose--I'd consider it unsportsmanlike, but that is a completely personal moral judgement. Others might consider the use of specific weapons/devices (like the V40 mini) to be unsportsmanlike, but I don't. So implementing rules against some of these things wouldn't really be fair, nor conducive to what we come to expect from playing on PURE servers.
** It's a really, really big gray area, and enforcing rules like this would require the sort of subjective analysis to which PURE is generally opposed.**
I can't believe someone actually has any doubts of how its going to end,  it's Naruto guys , we all know Naruto is going to get some ultimate power out of someone's ass and face Madara. He'll fail ofc and madara will give his final bad guy speech , then wen all hope seems lost Naruto will stand up and use the power of friendship and willpower to wreck Madara's face , then everyone lives happily everafter :p
: Remember the Neji-Naurto fight? well swap Neji for Madara and add more flashy stuff
Ok, first, IANAL and I don't know where you live; but I'm an old fuck, with kids, and plenty of experiences with leases, breaking leases, and landlords.
Ok, here's your first issue. Does the lease provide for an early termination of the lease? Sometimes it says you can leave by paying 2 months or something. If not, do you have something in writing saying you're supposed to pay "half" or some other proportion? How did you determine what is "fair" and what's "overcharging"? Without that, you have a history of what you paid prior, which is going to make it look like that's what you agreed to, and now you've had a change of heart. Saying he lied to you, when you signed a lease with numbers on it and you've been paying X amount, isn't a very strong argument -- I wouldn't want to be in your shoes telling a judge "hey, i didnt know what I signed" or how much the lease was or how much i was paying (%).
More bad news. You can't break the lease (usually) without both Land lord and your co-signers agreeing (and, if one or both agrees, i'd get it in writing). Otherwise your roommate can come after you to hold you to the lease and/or (definitely) the Land Lord will hold you and roommate to the lease terms. And, either roommate and/or landlord would win, if it goes to a judge and one or the otehr want to make you pay. Roommate could probably get you to keep paying what you had. Landlord usually can make either of you liable for the entire remaining rents.
I'd be sure I have some casual pictures in my phone of my stuff, and it's condition; so if shit starts to actually turn up damaged, you can sue roommate for its replacement... and btw, his sublettors or guests are his responsibility if they break your shit, either way. 
Now, ratting his extra sublettors out to the landlord, in a nice -- "hey, here's a heads up and I don't like it and can you break our lease or otherwise evict us" might be your best bet to get out of this bad deal. 
 Not paying your roommate what you used to pay based on your unilateral decision on what's fair, is a bad plan. 
Background:  My friend met a seemingly nice and mentally stable girl. After 6 months, she mentions that they should move in together (sign one).  They look at a house to rent.  Due to time constraints, they need to make a decision within three days.  He gets cold feet, and she gives him an ultimatum, either move in or break (sign 2).  They move in together, and so starts her very erratic and bipolarish behavior.  This past Friday, they meet up for happy hour.  She asks, " how much do you love me?" Him, "ehhhh."  In all seriousness, she asks, " is okay if I sleep with my boss to get a promotion?  It's not a big deal. It's just sex."

And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, ooohhh" - Ace of Base
You gotta do this dude, honestly hes intimidating you to control you, and no offense, but your letting him do it by playing this powerless character.  Avoiding confrontation is not the answer here.  We're often told that fighting is not the answer, but this is one of those times when you gotta stand up for yourself.  If you do nothing this will just continue and even worse he will do it to others as well because he now knows it works.
Check this asshole before he wrecks you.
Sociopath is a dated term, but it's usually used these days to describe psychopath-spectrum behaviors. These would include things like diminished empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behavior. While those could be the case here, whether or not someone's a psychopath depends a lot more on their internal landscape. 
 Maybe, or she could be just plain manipulative.
altunial puts it well, you need some of this energy. 
In addition, a concept I've found useful is this:  "Be outcome independent."  In other words,  possess yourself independently of the outcome of any given situation.  If you have self-respect, and behave according to your highest understanding, you have nothing to reproach yourself for;  and if the guy you're considering doesn't meet your profile, it doesn't mean anything about you, or about him; but you are *independent of the outcome!* 
I found it very freeing. Difficult to maintain, when the whole scheme is to lean closer to the Other...but, ultimately, crucial to success.  
tl, dr: Outcome independent.  Be who you are.  Nothing else works.
And one cannot play with a simulator?
Alternatively, "an activity that one engages in for amusement". One cannot find amusement in simulation? Many real world pilots fly for recreation ("activity done for enjoyment when one is not working"). Would you argue that flying, real world or in simulation, cannot be enjoyed?
 I still see no exclusivity between definitions.
You're taking what I said and making it sound black and white. Of course taking some steps to learn builds, meta, and overall flow of the game is needed all of which can be studied through videos and streams. Normal gives you little to go off of. AI teaches you how to play your champ and helps you calculate damage output of whatever you are playing. Although in normals you play against players who may have various play styles I have seen players who mainly play AI get the best of players who have over 1k games in normals. That being said, it might have to do with the fact that some people who play AI just push and exploit the fact that bots can't do certain things to get fed while others spend time practicing mechanics/champions within a stress free environment. 
If this was me beginning of last year I would tell you bots offer you little, but after playing with many players who play bots I have come to the conclusion they honestly give you a better foundation for new players. You can learn and play the game at your own pace without teammate confrontations.
I have been playing since Season 1 and lately I have been playing lots of AI or Ranked. I'm gold on 2 smurfs and was Plat 1 last season.
 Don't play ranked once you hit 30 until you think you have enough understanding of the game and have the tools(Runes/Champions) you need to compete with other players on equal footing. Whether you play AI to learn the game or Normals, either choice can lead you to a better understanding of the game and help become a better player.
She said along the lines of this isnt West Virginia with vigilantes and such in reference to someone saying he wanted to chase some greenies up a tree and shoot them like possums. Really there wasnt much in it, Helen was quite restrained given the abuse she got. 
The locals were pretty upset at the time, things were said.
Umm, this guy sounds crazy, and he just happens to be gay. I live around the same area and I know of a couple of people who seem a little bit "off". 
The take-away here is: the LGBT community is like any other. There are bound to be a few creepy folks who just happen to fall within the LGBT spectrum. I'm gay, and I've hung around in the village a fair amount, and it's not unheard of to get stuck talking to an older creepy guy now and again. It's particularly jarring for some straight guys because they're not used to being on the receiving end of that kind of interaction. Not to say that all straight guys are creepy or anything. 
My suggestion to you is take the high road and and let him know that his attention is unwelcome. From then on, just ignore him. He's probably just doing it to get a reaction out of you. 
 The guy is probably a little bit crazy and looking for attention. Being a part of the LGBT community doesn't really factor into it, outside of some of the remarks he's making. 
Every plane I ever flew (largest was akin to a king air 200) had it as a constant related to stall speed.
I looked it up.  It seems there's a "rule of thumb" of -.8 knots per 100lbs under MGW.  That would be wholly negligable on the small planes I flew.
I also looked it up for airliners.  A 737 (relatively small) can vary as much as 40 knots (though I had a hard time finding definitive answers) in the extreme (right at max landing weight to almost empty).  I would contend though, that for a given flight, they are always landing at (very close to) the same weight.  Basically the minimum to make their alternate.  Otherwise they're wasting money, given the margins in the industry, I suspect that variability in approach air speed is pretty minimal.
you're right, but I suspect in actuality the variability is quite small.
"hand is perfect" equating to having 1 medraut and an equip card that isn't excaliburn.

Borz Beatdown &gt; Peredur Beatdown because you can dump queen and equip it onto borz while potentially getting an extra noble arm. 
Having out two gwens is stupid. It clogs your backrow for traps and other noble arms. You're forgetting that your boss has 3 arms on it. Having 3 arms + 2 gwens does what? 
your analysis is bad and you should feel bad. And you didn't reply to my comment, so you fail in that regard as well 

I understand why you are posting this here, but you will probably get a better, technical responses from /r/buildapc. 
I have been looking to build a new machine for my gaming purposes, and will probably go with an Intel core i5 this time, as opposed to an AMD chip. This will be the first Intel chip I've used in a gaming machine since I bought a Pentium 133MHZ way back in the day. 
I've always liked AMD as the underdog, and been fairly happy with their chips. When they bought ATi I thought I would try out the new video cards, but have bounced back an forth between nVidia and ATi/AMD. The last nVidia card I purchased was an 8800GT, which is still sitting in one of my older machines.
 Create a budget for the new build, and then buy the best you can afford. Check this site out for a simple breakdown: 
One argument that I'm starting to like the more I hear it is completely public-funded elections. Remove donors, don't allow parties to collect money, and instead fund all elections directly from the public purse with parties receiving an equal share and clear spending limits.
Of course, you run into issues when your country has numerous political parties; especially smaller fringe parties that may have single-digit or even no representation in the legislature. But when you have parties directly tied to the people's money, I think you increase the need for spending it wisely and with better accountability. 
It would also decrease some of the nastiness in politics; since parties would see decreased advertising spending and would likely chose to focus on policy planks for their ad money, rather than character assassinations. 
 you have to get big money out of the parties and start the parties off on an equal playing field. 
Lissandra main here, I would say she is a more damaging shen without the taunt, I main her top lane and very rarely mid. At top if you take teleport instead of ignite you do lose the kill potential on your lane opponent but at 6 if your bot is being pushed in a journey bot often results in either you or your adc getting a fantastic early lead that can be snowballed.
My mindset when playing liss: If I think I am capable of dealing more damage than my adc I will be looking for an engage or picking someone out of position. If I think my adc can do more, I will dedicate myself to peeling.
She is a great vs most melee, and I find myself winning lane vs both renek and riven.
Preferred runes : MS quints, ap blues, hybrid pen reds(vs melee) or magic pen(vs ranged) and either armor or mr yellows depending on matchup.
 Can exploit her kit better at top, if fed look for fights, if adc is more fed peel for them, take tele for stupid ganks bot or for counter ganks, Good counter vs renek/riven. If you don't buy dfg second after hourglass kill yourself.
Have fun :)

Its a Subreddit dedicated to GentlemanGames, a dude who Streams video games and does funny stuff on youtube. It was created by a fan after I started to grow in popularity on twitch. It started off as a joke and then became a silly but serious place and then no one posted there anymore. 
 It's just a fan page, for a silly guy who is trying to achieve his dreams.
I think to really go better than that you should create a PGP keypair and cryptographically sign the essay you submit online. Then you can present your prof with the corresponding public key (preferably even do this before you submit it online), so they know it was your key that signed it. For an extra bit of proof also sign the amended, post peer review, essay so that they can see both essays were signed by the same person with a key that has your name and email address on it. 
Like I said, five them the public key before posting it online to really help your case, they would have a hard time disputing that. If they did dispute it point them to the school's maths or CS staff.

Shameless plug for my /r/fullsizebronco ...

I seriously wish instructors would stop treating plagiarism as being in a worse category than many major crimes. 
The idea behind plagiarism being bad is that you are bringing nothing new to the table. You are trying to get credit for someone else's work, which is bad, but you really are just being intellectually lazy. 
Citing your sources is meant to show where you got your ideas and facts from so that others who read it can check and see if they can come to the same conclusion. It's the same idea behind why scientific studies are only taken seriously if their results can be replicated. 
It was a journalism professor who finally explained it well to me. Not a single English instructor was able to explain the reasoning behind punishing plagiarism. 
This lead me to believe that academia will only take you seriously once you have "PhD" at the end of your name. This attitude seems incredibly common and has lead to many students becoming disheartened by what appears to be academic elitism. In reality, English instructors can't seem to explain shit. 
 Bringing down the banhammer on plagiarism does more harm than good because no one really understands the "Why." 
I can't comment on English stuff but I am in my final year of an undergraduate in Theoretical Physics and nobody brings the banhammer down on plagiarism and it's a rampant problem.
There is a group of students in my year that blatantly copy off each other but due to the nature of undergraduate physics/mathematics it is hard to point a finger when so many of the assignment problems we are given are pretty cut and dry and profs are squeezed on time marking them because the TAs are servicing the bio students who complain about physics (despite my school having a policy where 40% in the biophysics class will get you a pass, I shit you not). 
In my differential equations II class we got brutal assignments that took up to 20 hours to solve sometimes and you were ALWAYS wrong. I work in a fairly smart study group, and we would get together work out what the answer would be and then in the consequent 7 pages of methods somebody would inevitably make a mistake and we would always end with different answers. The plagiarism group had the ring leader reported  because they all got the same answer which is impossible in that course unless you actually got the answer right. However he got word that the authorities were coming down on  him and he dropped the class immediately which protected him from allegations because he wasn't in the class he couldn't be charged.

The hammer is necessary and much needed in undergraduate mathematics but due to the nature of study it's incredibly hard to accuse others. 
/r/MedicalCoding and /r/MGMA
I will preface this by saying that these are only of interest to people in the United States, as these both have to do with our healthcare industry.  I made /r/MGMA because I am one of the youngest members of the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) that I know of, and I wanted a sub where tech savy office managers, practice managers, or aspiring medical executives could network, ask questions, share articles, discuss the domains of knowledge, share our experiences, whatever.
Similar to that, I created /r/MedicalCoding because I'm a medical coding expert, consultant, and instructor.  I normally comment on the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC) forum, but I found a lot of thei questions and answers there to be repetitive or unhelpful, and there is no real moderation at all on their forums.  I figured reddit would be another great venue to ask simple or complex medical coding questions, share experiences, ask questions about becoming certified, etc.  
**- If you are in the US and interested in getting into the healthcare field in a non-clinical role, these 2 subs can help!**

*it started as a small comment and I went on a rant, sorry*
I 1000% agree with this. My first two Roo's I had a rule not to leave for centeroo until after 2 pm. I only time I broke that was for The Beach Boys. And boy did I fucking rock out easily til 3 am every night.
Cut to this past year. My sleep habits might be different because I left bartending and got a 9-5. But we were in centeroo early most days this year. Macklemore, Frank Turner and Trombone Shorty all had me in earlier than I normally went in and know how to plan for. Don't get me wrong the music was amazing and I loved the shows but I was beat everyday.
I made 15 min of Pretty Lights. I caught only parts of Billy Idol, Weird Al and R. Kelly. And after the pit for Macklemore, shrooms for Edward sharpe-st Vincent (where in between we wandered and saw Ed Helmes) me and my girlfriend just laid on a blanket for Tom Petty. We wanted to move and dance but our bodies kept screaming fuck you this is what you get.
I wouldn't trade my last year experience for anything honestly because it was my happiest Roo. But if I just partied/paced better I would have had a more memories and would have seen more amazing late night acts.
 bonnaroo isn't a sprint it's a marathon, pace yourself accordingly 
If this is for realsies this question does not belong in reddit or anywhere really outside of the hospital you work in.
I'm not sure about the laws in your region (afaik we don't live in the same country). Where I live with that kind of information it would be easy to get him into psych evaluation, which means that he would be hospitalized for few days and after that the necessity of hospitalization would be reconsidered.
Also it might be possible to deem him medically unfit to handle his own care and go from that angle.
9 days without sleeping should give him enough loss of reality to get him into psych eval.
In any case I highly doubt you're a doctor and if you are you should have a lot better sources for this dilemma than reddit.
Lawyer up, pack your bags.
I'll start by saying I can't answer your question. However, I can shed some limited light on the world of quartz-watches. Mostly, I find people approach quartz watches from two different directions: HEQ and HAQ. High-end Quartz watches and High-accuracy Quartz watches. Which do you want? One very good resource for information is the [WUS-category for HAQ](
If accuracy is important to you, you've probably heard about COSC, a Swiss organisation that tests individual watches and if they pass the requirements, they get an individual serial number and a certificate for being accurate enough to be called a chronometer. Quartz watches can be certified too and their requirements are much tougher: A quartz watch must be accurate to +/- 0.07 seconds per day (or +/-25 seconds per year) to be certified. A mechanical watch needs to be accurate from -4 to +6 seconds per day.
Breitling has all their watches certified, but most other manufacturers send only some of their models for certification. That doesn't mean they aren't accurate enough, though. It just means they don't have it in black and white. 
In my personal opinion, there's one quartz watch in particular that often gets mentioned when watch nerds turn their attention towards quartz watches: the Omega X-33, which is the LCD-equipped quartz version of the Speedmaster Professional and supposedly the successor to the Speedy Pro for manned space missions. It's not a very accurate watch for a quartz - it couldn't get cosc certified, since many users report a deviance of up to 60 seconds per year. 
The X-33 is certified by Nasa and frequently seen on astronaut's wrists in videos from the ISS. My guess is that might be more of a marketing stunt, but who knows. I have read several reviews about it being a very good tool watch for multiple purposes. I think what makes it stand out is that it's accurate enough, it's got the Omega Speedmaster brand behind it, it's got Nasa, it looks ok, even good to some people, it has the pedigree of a very good watch, plus it's been designed as a functional tool. 
Then we have my favourite, the Breitling Aerospace, which I chose because of [its looks]( Its B-79 movement is COSC certified, fairly accurate and the watch looks darn good in my opinion. But it's insanely difficult to operate: Breitling decided to be minimalist about it and put all functions behind ONE button, the crown, which you can rotate in both directions at TWO different speeds, press in, pull out, etc. To activate the backlight, you rotate slowly, to change modes you rotate fast. Fortunately for people who want to actually use the functions, they have the B-1 with almost the same movement that puts the functions behind "normal" chronograph pushers. Sadly, its dial is too busy for my taste.
Breitling's movement is called a "superquartz" movement and employs something called thermocompensation, which means the movement measures variations in temperature and adjusts the speed accordingly to achieve higher accuracy. The X-33, oddly enough isn't thermocompensated.
If you're looking for a high-end watch, then maybe the Grand Seiko ticks your boxes? It uses Seiko's F9-movement and is regarded by many as the most advanced quartz watch in the world, so maybe that's the answer to your question. I think I've heard it's accurate to about +/- 10 seconds a year. It looks really nice, more like a fancy dress watch and many watch enthusiasts seem to regard it as highly as Rolexes (or even higher), which for beginners sounds strange, as they are accustomed to thinking about Seikos as low-end, cheap watches. The GS costs at least $3000. 
I also mentioned the tag Heuer Calibre S. That was TH's attempt att making a sort of hybrid between a quartz and a mechanical movement. The CEO of TH said he regarded it more as a mechanical movement because of all the mechanical components in it, but bottom line is that it's a quartz. It's got a perpetual calendar and its gimmick is showing the date using two separate retrograde hands. They can both show numbers from 1 to 10 and together they show today's date. On the 23rd, the left points at 2 and the right at 3. I have the Aquaracer Calibre S, but as far as I know, that model is now discontinued. It has had some technical problems and I only wanted it for the coolness factor.
I'll wrap this up by pointing to one more interesting candidate: The newly released thermocompensated movement by ETA called Precidrive, featured in the new Certina DS 2. It's at least as accurate as the GS mentioned earlier at a fraction of the cost (about $850 or 600€). It's something to keep your eye on and many people at WUS are nominating it for the HAQ watch of the year 2013. 
***: Grand Seiko is good but pricey, Speedmaster X-33 is legendary but not that accurate, Certina DS-2 looks average to me, but has cutting edge technology and a low price tag. I love the Breitling Aerospace despite all its faults.
Most people refer to 'empty calories' as ones coming from high-calorie, low-nutrient sources. For example, you could easily sit down and drink your daily requirement of 2000 calories in beer, but all of them come from simple carbohydrates.  The drink is still lacking in vitamins, minerals, proteins and fats essential to your survival. 
High Calories != Nutrition
I'm 48. If I started smoking 1 pack a day when I was 18 at an average cost of $5.00 I would have spent approximately $56620.00. I've got way more than that in my bank account but you can't see it, you'll just have to believe me, or not.
TLDR. Smokers are dumb. Don't do it.
or even be anywhere near where the business end was previously.  The depleted uranium used in the bullets is basically nuclear waste, that despite being less radioactive than it was in previous form, is toxic and mutagenic. e: The bullets upon impact become hot enough to liquify, effectively spraying (and partially vaporizing) their remains making cleanup very difficult.
**TLDR** How to we get rid of this nuclear waste? Make it into bullets and spray it all over 3rd world countries.
Singapore definitely.
I'm a Malaysian who's in Vancouver studying, and trust me on this, working in Singapore is absolutely going to change the way you think about life.
You're going to be introduced to a whole new world of food and cuisines (Theres always a restaurant open, no matter the time); its teeming with cultures from across the globe; everything there is reliable and efficient (including the people) and the connections you'll make there are really going to boost your career.
While Singaporeans themselves are kinda hardassed about things (the laws there are a bit much), you'll have an incredible time. The cost of living there is so inexpensive compared to the states. 
Spending 200$ will get you a flight to any of the neighbouring countries as well as lodging for a few days.
Speaking of, go to Malaysia for a weekend, if you're willing to experiment (nothing too crazy) Malaysia has much better food. PM me if you want a list of my favourite restaurants and what to order.
*** Go. Good food, reliable people, great connections to be made, cheap-ish place to live.
Always called it Ring of Fire, don't know if it's a region thing. I know the rules differ too, but in the one we played we got bored of the 5 rule (can't actually remember, but it was too similar to another rule) 
This was a couple of years ago now before I moved to London and about 20 minutes into the game we kept skipping 5 so I thought, why don't we add a little dancing into the game? The person that gets 5 starts with a little dance, the next person does the first dance then their own and it continues until someone forgets a dance and has to drink.
I ended up naming it '5 is jive'. It's great fun doing silly dances and trying to remember them all. I made it up a couple of years ago, moved and I have mostly different friends but I've introduced it and it's still used whenever we play the game and everyone seems to enjoy it, so I'm sadly proud.

**Five is Jive**
**The card holder does a little dance (like the chicken dance), next person does the first dance then their own and this continues until someone forgets a previous dance.**

There are a few things. I hadn't realized that there were a few things that I need to keep her online once she actually gets something going, so in a sense she costs more than 1UBR. For example, in my playgroup she get Chaos Warp'd, Spun into Myth or Faith's Fetters'd whenever I try to make a desperation play with her. Like, when I don't have a sac effect or boots/greaves to put on her. In this same vein, I can't do much about Nevermore, and she's a pretty popular option for that card.  
  
The other thing is that you need things like Soothsaying, Scroll Rack or Crystal Ball to keep her consistent, otherwise she gets my lands and walkers instead of my Din of the Fireherd and Cruel Ultimatum. I'll just say at this point that it's totally my fault for not using tutors to get these things, but I feel like running TOO many non-land tutors makes the game less fun for me personally. I already run a few and I'm not particularly interested in running as many as I feel like I would have to.  
  
I'm a big whiny baby
That completely depends on you, your area, and your bees.  In a perfect  year you drop  your bees off, they do amazing without any help, and you open the hive to harvest honey!  In reality you may need to feed and manage your bees roughly once every 2-3 weeks, plus time for extracting, painting boxes, making splits, and all that kind of junk.  
When I first started I spent roughly one hour on the bees every two weeks for my four hives.  Now I am a commercial beekeeper, and managing 200 hives per day is not unheard of. 
 It is up to you how fast you want to work and how hard you want to work.
Highlights from the list of alpha things his GF complained about:
&gt;Telling her what to do
&gt;Not caring about what she wants to do or how she feels
&gt;Not listening to her when she says something
And when she described how the boyfriends of her friends acted:
&gt;Bought their gfs flowers after their exams
&gt;Make them breakfast
&gt;Always ask how they are doing
His conclusion:
&gt;So what she basically said was that I was too alpha for her and she wanted a beta? What the fuck?
Yeah, she sounds really unreasonable, always expecting her boyfriend to care about what she wants and to listen to her. What a horrible person.
TL; DR: Another happy relationship ruined by TRP.
Not quite. You are still limited in the number of consecutive rounds you can fly. Fortunately, flying more than 10 minutes per day has no overall penalty due to your immunity to fatigue.  
&gt;A dragonborn can safely fly for a number of consecutive rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). She can double this length of flight but is fatigued by such exertion.
You can fly for 2 x Con mod consecutively for no penalty (since you are immune to fatigue), but no more than that. Again, you can just stop and glide for a round, and resume flying. 
*** Immunity to fatigue = almost unlimited flight. 
I've been cycling for a long, long time in a big city (Montreal). From my experience I must say that bus drivers scare me a lot less than your"average" driver out there.

Bus drivers don't get enough love.
Is the UMC animal farm the one near spawn? With the cool animal heads? If so I've actually been working on dye for the sheep. I've been meaning to post here asking if its okay if I go ahead and breed the sheep, drag them into the pens and dye.
TLDR I can help dye and organize the sheep.
My Flappy Bird experience:
Friend posts a score of 5, asking people to top it.
Guy posts 11.
I get 39 and don't post it. I just send as a message.
She says she hates me, and asks me what it felt like to get so close to 40 and not get it.
Tell awkward story about being young, and peeing pants in kindergarten...
Hate turns into love.
I get to 47.
She tells me to uninstall it, as I have a problem.
I am content with never getting to 50.
.. I spend 3 hours on the game and was left with a sore finger and a friend thinking I was obsessed. I can't wait for part 2.
The oceans are still larger than all the ants in the world combined...I think. Seems like the thing to do would be to get away from land - zeppelins and ultimately ships would make the best refuge. If it were to happen right now most of the world would probably be screwed unless they could get to their cars. Those on vessels in port would be toast as well, since most of them would not be able to pull away fast enough. I'm thinking that US Carrier Groups would play a large role in our subsequent recovery and counterattack.
The first priority of the carriers and their escorts would be to get to deeper water, further away from shore. There are a few species of ants that can walk on water and build bridges over small water obstacles. I'm not sure how many of those there are (you'll have to ask /u/Unidan for that one) but if they were able to organize enough to declare war on humans, you can bet that they'll try to come after the humans still on the water. If they did get close to a carrier we could drop some soap or similar chemical into the water to lower its surface tension and make the ants sink. (carriers have to have soap of some kind, right?) Anyway, once the various ships that managed to survive the initial onslaught make it a good distance from shore, the next priorities would be contacting other survivors and organizing a plan of attack.
A U.S. Nimitz-Class carrier is home to a population of about 5,000 personnel, I think ( and there are 10 of them currently in service. If we're pessimistic with our estimations and assume that one was overwhelmed before it could escape, that leaves at least 45,000 humans left to continue the struggle. It's likely that more humans will survive than that, but I don't have numbers on any other vessels and I don't like anyone's chances if they stay on land. There might be a few islands that will be able to contain their ant problems, perhaps. Nevertheless, 45,000 people puts us well within the number needed to ensure the continued survival of the human race, even if only 10% of those people are female. As long as we're able to secure supplies, we won't need to worry about inbreds running the reclaimed world.
Which brings us to an important caveat: supplies. The Nimitz characters are nuclear and can run continuously for years, but the people onboard need food every day. There would come a time in a few months when it would be necessary to secure these supplies, one way or another. Now the ants might realize this weakness and set about destroying every edible thing they can get their mandibles on, but considering that the only thing an ant knows about humans is that it wants to kill them (for some reason), I don't think that will be the case. I think the most viable method of getting food in the short term would be to send teams of helicopters out and try to secure relatively non-perishable goods, such as canned food and ramen noodles, from supermarkets and distribution centers. It's likely that nearby ant colonies would be able to feel the vibrations in the ground and seek out our brave Wal-Mart Raiders, which would necessitate the use of helicopters for fast extraction. It would be like playing "the floor is lava," but with much higher stakes. Any surviving hovercraft might be useful, but only for locations very close to the coast. I have no idea if the carriers would have enough helicopter teams to sustain themselves this way, or how long their fuel reserves would hold out. Daily raids might be necessary. Rationing will probably be necessary.
UPDATE: /u/Averyhonestguy has raised a very sobering point - some ants can fly! This would make things much more difficult for people on land and near land. I don't think that the carrier groups far away would be too much worse off - flying takes a lot of energy, and after a few good miles the ants would likely drop out of the sky from exhaustion. It would greatly speed the response time of ants alerted to human presence, and make the helicopter raids that much more dangerous.
Okay, back to the overall situation. The carrier groups can sustain themselves by raiding superstores and the like, but the helicopter's fuel reserves would only last for so long. At some point, possibly years from the initial ant invasion, humanity would have to return to dry land. The target to recolonize would have to be an island - any spot on a continent would eventually be overwhelmed by sheer numbers or shortages of supplies. This island would have to have arable land as well. One of the Hawaiian islands may be a good candidate. Ants are present there, but the island chain has extreme isolation and fertility, hopefully enough to support 45,000 people. We'd have to clear out the islands before settling there - we could collect seed samples of the flora and breeding pairs of the fauna we wanted to keep via helicopter and then firestorm the fuck out of the island. A terrible crime against nature, certainly, but necessary for the survival of our species. Flamethrower teams (do they even have flamethrowers on carriers?) would sweep the cleared land after the ashes settled, rooting out any stray nests. Constant vigilance would be required once humans were back on the island, in case any ants somehow managed to get back on the island. But with the island, we finally have a little breathing room, and can focus on rebuilding the ecosystem on the napalm-scorched earth.
It would take Hawaii a long time to get back on its feet after being firebombed back to the Cambrian Period, but we could probably pull it off. Now assuming that the carrier groups haven't split due to internal politics and become Water World-esque pirates, some attention needs to be paid to the beginnings of reclamation. There are two ways to go about this, and one of them is slightly more boring than the other. The first method would see carrier groups sailing to a small but developed island nation, say, Taiwan, and attempting to seize the means of production necessary for large-scale manufacturing of powerful poisons, which could be then sprayed over ideal areas of recolonization, such as farms near to rivers or the coast. The new Hawaiians would be encouraged to reproduce as much as possible if this method saw success, in order to establish human presence around the globe. This would take hundreds of years, in all likelihood, and would be a great deal more complex than what I've just outlined, but we would be fighting. Fighting and winning, hopefully.
The second option involves a small group that I've ignored up until this point - the US nuclear submarine fleet. I assume that they would eventually resurface and fall in with the carrier groups, and if recon showed large clusters of ant populations in certain areas, we could use the nuclear option. There would be catastrophic damage, of course, but the nuclear missiles of today are actually much "cleaner" than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, and I'm not sure, but I think that the fallout dissipates much more rapidly than the first two did. This method would only be attractive if the ants had tendencies to cluster or form superhives, but if they did, imagine - bomb the 3 or however many superhives in England, finish off the rest in your NBC gear armed with a flamethrower or poisoned SuperSoaker, and have a thriving human colony a few years later.
The continents are a much harder question. They may be unsalvageable, at least without constant warfare to protect our holdings. But this was a bit of a silly question in the first place.
Disclaimer: I'm not an ant invasion expert.
Get a job on a carrier, fast-rope into Walmart, firebomb Hawaii, and nuke the Brits.
Needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few, so when this case comes up again will we wait for them again or is this just a one time thing? If we wait for them again it's unnecessarily dragging things out. 
In my case I'm not even sure if I'll have power by morning with a snow storm currently shitting on my city right now so if given the opportunity I'd like to play my next game A.S.A.P

**I'm shitty with wording things:** Sim them so the rest of us can play this weekend.
Yeah I do, but I'll be the first to say that's not a very healthy attitude. Especially when people like you are here telling people they owe the world something -- rather than that motivation coming from some altruism within.
 even though I give my time and love freely to perfect strangers, I don't owe you shit &lt;3
The purpose of creating something like music or games or any art really is to share it right? There are some exceptions, you don't make rock music for people who like rap, but in this case, this game is really accessible, everyone understand, everyone can enjoy it. NOW it got popular, Dong Nguyen started to be way more popular to, now he want to stay indepedant, an indie game developer, now through this popularity rising, he gained money, wich is what a dev need to be able to finance the game he wants to do, with all this money he can probably do a lot of things that he would have never consider before, so that's a plus. Now apareantly he couldn't deal with the fact that people were accusing him of stealing (if you are objective, the fact that the pipe are like the one in mario doesnt matter at all it could have been anything else, it's stupid to be mad about it, it's really not important), he also couldn't deal with the fact that people were accusing him of runing their lives, because they were so addict to the game. Nguyen, why do you take this on yourself? There is ALWAYS Criticism about games, negative postitive, constructive, mean, if you can't take any bad comment or if you give attention to the obviously childish and stupid hate comment, then don't share your game, cause it will never change. Now he was also harassed by some media to interview him, and by business company to make games with him, he declared he didn't want to. Wouldn't they leave him alone after a few weeks or at least the majority of it? This is almost the only real problem i can see. The fact that he deleted his game from the app store is really illogical, and for me nguyen doesn't have a logical response to this game popularity that happened to him. Paying attention and even answering to some hate tweet is really dumb.. I don't get why you would like to create things that are meant for sharing if u can't accept the fact that some people will say it's bad. If you don't agree (and have GOOD reason to) or if u have other argument, answer me, don't downvote without telling why, i really don't why people disagree with me.
: Dong Nguyen response to this whole popularity is really illogical to me, and it's stupid that he cared so much about the negativity even when it's just blind none constructive hate. Imo if you can't accept the fact that you will get bad feedback or mean one, you shouldn't create content that are meant for sharing in the first place, if you're just gona take it away because you can't take any negative feedback (i know this is not the only reason, read the whole thing)
Sean on Screwattack's Hard News had a good thought on this game.  I'm paraphrasing but essentially was this guy supposedly made the game in 3 days and is making about 50g a day from ad revenue meanwhile other indie devs put their heart and soul into their title and may never even recoup anything financial.  He finished by saying don't download the game and if you did delete it. 
 step your reading game up 
I'm still learning RES and I'm having sooo much fun doing so!
The RES way is THE way to reddit. The people giving you shit can only DREAM of having any creativity in anything.
 fuck tha haters...
Well said. That's exactly how I feel. In fact, that is so spot on, that I now feel bad that you typed out everything I was feeling, and the whole world now knows how I feel... And I didn't even have to do anything. 
TL/DR: I couldn't have said it any better
My girlfriend keels me up at night with that game.. Even with no sound, 'tap TAP TApPP..pi'. I tried.
 very frustrating game, interrupts sleep of s/o's everywhere.
Well said. Humans pretty much envy those who are successful because *they* aren't successful. In reality, he made a game that should have been what most mobile games should be - _fun_. Not a game that depends on psychology and money to lure people back.
If anything, this guy is an inspiration for gamers and game devs alike - a game CAN be successful and profitable without resorting to dirty tricks. If anything, I hope that his work inspires other game devs - both indie and corporate ones - to create great games like his, with no money strings attached. There is money to be found by doing good.
human nature sucks, gaming is saved
Piggy backing on your comment. I know nothing about the game or the drama that is doing on right now but removing a game seems like an over reaction by a 12 year old. Removing it is going to to do nothing but hurt the people that may want to try it. (apparently it got hype surrounding it "and press were overrating the success of Flappy Bird and his other titles") 
Seems to me like it got bad reviews and now hes mad and is doing this as a statement so they will rate it higher or get his fans to beg for it back so he can say "SEE HOW POPULAR IT IS"
the creator sounds childish for over reacting.
Oh and before I forget, here is a photo of the sidebar:

That was my source for the first point. 
 you should read the rules, fatty
Everyone experiences these things from time to time. I am 20 years old with Muscular Dystrophy and I'm bound to a wheelchair. I just went through my teenage years without experiencing anything a teenager should experience, like kissing a girl, partying, drinking, driving (never mix those two together), dating, and many more of everyday life that everyone else enjoys. My disease usually keeps keeps people from living a long life, and I know that there are many more things that everyone has the right to experience that I most likely won't get to do, like marriage, having kids/grandkids, seeing the country/world, etc. Even when I admit all that openly on the Internet for the whole world to see I'm still fine. Does it sadden me some? Yes, but I don't let it control my thinking and mood. When you get depressed you give up control of your head to those racing and unproductive thoughts. I never let myself get depressed for more than a couple days, because what goes on in my head, my thoughts are the only true thing that I 100% own and control, and I'm not gonna let darkness grow in my head and take control. Yes, those are just words and it sometimes can be harder to fight the darkness. So when I start getting down, I start saving up some money, and when I get enough money I get myself something new/nice. I'm a techy kinda guy so I'll get myself a new phone or an xbox one and I'll just have fun with it. One thing that definitely makes me happy is going out and eating a good meal. It's simple, but if I get a good meal (soul food, southern food) I can't not have a smile on my face! As to your "going to keep things simple for a week" plan, if you feel/know that's what you need, then go for it! However, we all need a little spice in our life, so don't keep things simple for long. You gotta change things up every now and then, be spontaneous, unpredictable to yourself and do something fun. I realize not everyone has money, but just save some up over time, off to the side little by little, and go to a mall or to amazon and go for an impulse buy, get something you normally wouldn't get yourself. Last summer, I went on an impulse to get into flying R/C planes, it's a good hobby, and it put me around a bunch of old retired guys who had funny/interesting life stories to share, and I had a good time! On a final note, I'm gonna tell you something that I learned in a cheap blow off class in my time at a small 2 year college. There are 2 words that start with the letter M that support a healthy life and a healthy mind. Motivation and Moderation. Always stay motivated to achieve more in life. And always keep everything in moderation, don't over indulge nor let anything become scarce. I've never done this whole too long, didn't read thing before, but just in case you didn't feel like reading all that...
tl; dr
Keep things fresh in your life, go hang out with new people, buy yourself something new/nice, treat yourself to a good meal every now and then. 
Can you give us a quick on that? 
Yeah, if you are going to run testing, or unstable you should really pay close attention to what packages are being install/removed on an upgrade(I have learned this the hard way in the past too ;) ). Sometimes there maybe missing depenencies, and you will need to cycle through the different proposed resolutions, or just wait a few days and keep trying to see if the issue gets fixed. Also it is a good idea to install the bugs/changelog tools (mentioned in the unstable faq)and read the output when doing updates because upgrading some packages blindly will break your system, I typically pin a package or two a week.
don't blindly accept upgrades, and install the bugs/changelog tools if runnign testing, or sid.
Thank you, Debian team for your hard work :)
Top Prospects: Basically the whole team. Javier Baez is the top prospect that is still in the minors (he will be at spring training with a good chance of joining the big league club sometime this season). There are only a handful of veterans slotted in our line up, most notably Luis Valbuena at third base. These guys are basically just hold overs until all of our young players are fully developed. 5 years ago we were at the end of the previous era of Lee, Ramirez, Soriano, and Zambrano. We've finally gotten rid of all those guys and have a solid year or 2 of rebuilding under our belts. 
The top players are Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro. These guys did not live up to expectations last year after both being inked to long term big money deals. They are seen as the future of our organization at first and shortstop respectively (although Castro and the prospect Baez currently play the same position, so that will be something to watch). Our ace pitcher is Jeff Smmmmshark (see also: my flair). He is also relatively young and now signed to a nice contract. He may or may not be the ace of the future depending if he takes the next step forward, but at least he looks like a solid big league starter.
Pessimism for the season is not hard to come up with, we are projected to be the third worst team in the league, which is about on par with where we've been the last two years. Our offense over the last few years has been really lacking, we score most of our runs off of home runs but we don't hit a lot of home runs. We really lack clutch hitting, we leave runners on, and a lot of times those runs we leave out there are the difference for our pitching staff. The starting rotation is generally good, but can only do so much with no run support. The bullpen is questionable, and for this year that is where the most question marks lie. 
The main story surrounding the cubs over the last few years is the front office. Can Jed Hoyer and Theo Epstein break the Cubs curse as they did with Boston and the curse of the Bambino? It remains to be seen, but they are taking the same methodical approach.
As far as general cubs information, the history of the club is the most important thing to know about the cubs, possibly more important than who is on the field right now (especially because that can change quickly these days). Baseball history and the Cubs are more closely linked than all but a few franchises, as we are one of the senior members of the circuit and play in the second oldest stadium. Our stadium, up to this year, had an even older feel than any other stadium (including the oldest, Fenway) because of its notable lack of a jumbotron screen and because of it's famous characteristics of its large manual scoreboard and ivy covered walls. It's the 100th anniversary of the stadium this year, and the new owners are putting in a jumbotron and lots more advertising. Apparently this is something that is required to win a world series. 
The Cubs haven't won a world series in over 100 years. 1908 we were world champs and then 1909 we made it back and didn't win. Then we began the drought, we made a few appearances but never won (we lost to Babe Ruth on the called shot, famously, for example). In the 40s we made it to the series, but a curse was put on us by some guy who owned the now famous Billy Goat Tavern. He put a hex on (Wrigley?/)the Cubs because they wouldn't let him bring his goat into the stadium and we lost the series and have not been to a world series since. There have been other manifestations of the curse with the black cat in 69 against the mets and the bartman ball in 2003.
edit: GO CUBS GO
IMO the 780ti is too much money for 1080P gaming. I know you're not going to like this answer but I think your best bet for FPS at a great price is the R9 290. Not the X version. At 400 dollars it's great for 1080P
But if I were you I'd think long and hard about the 1440P monitor 144hz, because the colors and viewing angles might not be top notch. I'm of the mindset that you want to be able to buy a monitor every 5-8 years, so personally I like an eye candy monitor like IPS @ 1440 P 60hz that'll last you. With the 60 FPS lock you'll still get smooth frames plus great colors and 1440P with something like an AMD card. 
If you insist on the 144hz monitor though with G sync then I'd go 780ti
Just to add a TL:dr: I suggest 1440P IPS panel with a r9 290 non x card
As an American with the same aspiration, I can tell you that there is NOTHING wrong with wanting to move to Sweden.
I've traveled to Sverige quite a few times because my boyfriend is Swedish and we're kind of doing this long distance thing of sorts, so it works out. I've always wanted to come here to Sweden, and let me tell you this:
It was better than I ever could have imagined.
Swedish people are quiet, conservative and kind for the most part, and love Americans it seems like! Every time I come here I make more and more lifelong friends, and the beauty of this place never gets old. There is an astounding combination of city and nature, and it's fantastic.
Then of course, you have the HEAPS of wonderful socialist benefits that can be hard for us from the USA to imagine...
Free healthcare, Free college, and getting paid to do many things in society, like having children and attending school (for highschoolers, or what they call gymnasiet here), WITH BARELY ADDING AN EXTRA TAX PERCENT HERE.
And to your comment on Swedish women, yes, most of them tend to look that way from what I see, but be wary: Swedish girls can be quite cold to guys, but being foreign (and especially American) can ease that up quite a bit. They are beautiful and smiley and stick together in groups, and most of the guys here are incredibly shy, so they tend to appreciate a person that can actually approach them, from what I've seen.
Lastly, my biggest tip on learning the language, is make some Swedish friends that pretty much refuse to speak English to you, even though they have the best English from a foreign speaker you'll ever hear. Believe me, it can put a strain on your confidence at first, but it's well worth the giggles they give you for your silly American accent and misused grammar, but they'll happily teach you how to speak it better. Swedish is a very fun, magical language that is wonderful to speak and learn, even though it can be very difficult. 
TL;DR
Sweden is awesome and you should feel awesome for wanting to live there. :)
For everyone who is saying the Saints have a mess this year, it's like this every year and things get sorted out. The past few years we've been way over the cap heading into the offseason, and our FO still gets all major re-signings done (Brees got his contract, and Graham will get re-signed) and still have enough left over to bring in a few players who really contribute, even if they don't have big names (Hawthorne, Sproles and Keenan Lewis come to mind).
Yeah the Saints are ~14 mil over cap, and Will Smith who is going to get cut is taking up 13.9 mil so really we are near cap as is. Roman Harper, Jabari Greer, Lance Moore and Broderick Bunkley are all names that could be possible casualities, which would put the Saints under cap enough for the Graham re-signing, plus some role players.
And this is not even touching Brees' contract, which he has mentioned his willingness to restructure at some point.
Not sweating the Saints cap
Raid fights can easily last 100 seconds and longer. Even granting your supposition, and ignoring other factors like gear stats, passive traits, and instant-cast procs, that one extra spell could mean the difference between a clean boss kill and a wipe. And that's without even bringing in the differences that the rest of your party bring to the table. 
Clearly you're not a minmaxer. That's fine; neither am I. But there are people who are very, very good at crunching the numbers, and they can easily show you how big a difference that 10% will actually make, down to the last decimal point. 
 You're dead wrong. 
The majority of /r/arma is filled with videos, as is this subreddit. It isn't really up to the moderators to block video content, if they would, both /r/arma and /r/arma3 would be pretty quiet. 
 If people wish to see pictures or self.post submissions, it is up to them. /r/arma already has some great photographers, why not start throwing up some screenshots here as well?
 Personally, I enjoy the videos. Seeing that a video that is posted to /r/arma3 and /r/arma (and is upvoted) gets hundreds of views, it seems that people do enjoy the videos as well. 
- You want non-video content? Make some! More power to you.
I agree 100%. But is it better to ban videos from here and use /r/armavideos or something like that? or only ban promotion videos? 
I think the problem with all the video content, for me at least, is the fact that if you look at other subreddits and the way you consume content on reddit is usually in form of pictures with captions, small chunks of text or a discussion you can rather easily get into. If you look at /r/leagueoflegends the videos from there is a small clip of some player outplaying another guy, doing something amazing or funny. There's an easy reward from watching those as you can go "oh yeah he did an amazing job there", and if you look at /r/GlobalOffensive you see funny screenshots some discussions and the misc threads. But again, most of the content there is easy-to-digest small clips that have an immediate gratification after watching them.
With the content here on /r/arma3 and aswell /r/arma all of the videos here are ranging from 5-60 minutes with a lot of them being in the 10 minute area. I read somewhere that the attention span of people online are really hard to keep and most people lose interest after 2-3 minutes, and with long videos, most of it just feels like obsolete content because you won't sit around for 15 minutes, watching some random dudes trekking across altis with their gun down the side, not even getting into contact until the 8 minute mark.  Just to get it out of the way: the youtube clips most of the time are fine, but it's one of those cases where it's hell of a fun ride to experience in-game, but its boring as hell to watch on the sideline because you don't get any gratification like a league of legends clip Where some Pro player makes a sick pentakill with Soraka.
I have to admit, there's far between the times I sit down and watch playthrough of missions from random people. I stick to the ones I know I find entertaining, either funny or helpful, but the rest, maan I can't be bothered sitting still for 15 minutes looking at a fireteam doing a virtual march through the hills of Altis. 
**really TL:DR:** peoples attention span sucks and a lot of video content feels stupid here.
I use this weapon mainly on defense on maps like cp_gorge, cp_egypt, pl_barnblitz, or cp_mountainlab, where once I get my nest set up, I don't move it until it's been destroyed.  I'll go ahead and set up my teles, then I'll level up my sentry to lvl 2, then get my teles leveled up before lastly getting my dispenser and sentry up to level 3.  Depending on the map, I can usually get this done just a few seconds after the round starts, giving me a fully upgraded nest and fully upgraded teles that my teammates can use.
It's pretty powerful in those situations, but on maps like pl_upward, koth_lakeside, pl_badwater, etc where you need to move your nest, it's not good at all.
  Situationally excellent, but probably the worst choice in most other circumstances.
We did the hand-off thing for about nine months with our first. I hated it, and I campaigned heavily for her to be a SAHM, largely due to the ruinous effects on our relationship. It has not worked out very well. She's not happy in the role, but now she's been out of the workforce so long she probably can't get back in, certainly not at the level she left. Also, in retrospect I think my kids would have benefited from some additional socialization in daycare. if I had it to do over I'd go with daycare.
Our decision is based mostly around my wife's desire to keep working for the time being. We are in the position where we both make enough to cover the cost of both our sons in daycare, so we're lucky on that front.
I think you're likely being too harsh on yourself (and others) to equate working parents to absentee parents. They are not the same, in my opinion.
Our son likes daycare and has a ton of friends there. That doesn't change his desire to play with us at home and I don't feel like I am robbing him of his parents by having him at daycare.
It's basically school, and unless you plan to homeschool, the schedule will work out this way in a couple years regardless.
 Your wife's preference is very important and I don't think you'll be shortchanging your children. If you want to work less to get the kids earlier, great, but I'd focus on keeping the family together more than spreading hours around just to avoid daycare.
I'm in a daycare + alternating schedule family. I'll answer your question in two parts:
Day-care: we found an in home daycare situation. One lady who is great, 3-4 kids total all within a year of my son (2.5 years old). It is amazing. She works with them on all the things I would be if he were home with me and on top of that he gets to socialize with kids his own age. This is the way to go if you have to do daycare but its hard to find so be patient. Added bonus for us is all the kids he goes to daycare with he will also go to elementary school with and its only 165 a week. 
Alternating schedule: I work IT - 40 hours a week during the day and some on call. My wife is an ER nurse and works almost exclusively nights. She originally did nights when I was entry level working 2nd shift so it worked for us plus she figured we could save on daycare when we had kids. Ehhhhh! It was almost impossible for either of us to get enough sleep on that schedule so we depended on daycare, which is fine, we are pretty financially stable. The problem is it has been awful for our relationship, destructive beyond belief. When she started there she told me how everyone she worked with was divorced and unhappy etc, which was a warning sign. But it's not the job, its the hours. 
I knew it was getting bad and pleaded with her multiple times to change to a day schedule. She basically said no and then switched to a no set hours schedule meaning she can pick up any free hours at any time. She still only picks up nights because that's where all of her friends are and the people she knows. It got so bad that she told me this past summer that she wasn't in love with me anymore and we had grown apart but that wasn't true. She had grown apart from me because we never saw each other and I was the only one who realized what was happening and fought to fix/prevent it. 
We have come out of it a bit, she made some efforts to be around more for awhile but things are going back to the problem area because she is still fucking working nights and won't change for anything. The couple times we have fought about she has looked at day jobs but never applies and just waits for the situation to die down. When she is home she wants to spend all of her time with my son which I understand because she gets about half the time with him that I do, but I need her too and I get blown off completely. Oh and you know how hard having kids is on your sex life, if you switch to different schedules you better find a good porn stash because unless she is really going to make the effort you can plan on sex about as infrequent or more than when you were single. 
I can't say this loud enough, do not do alternative schedules. Maybe it will be different for you and you can make it work but do you want to take that chance when so many others have be destroyed by it? I know I haven't done everything right and there are things I could do or have done better but I also know I'm not alone in this plight. 
 Day care can be a good thing if you find the right situation. Go ahead and do alternative schedule if you are ready for the relationship to be over. 
Because criticism is a valid part of a hobby, art form, media, or anything really. It's not just important to point out what you like about something, it's also important to point out what you don't like.
Now granted, in this specific case, there wasn't much of note to the criticism. It was just a quick jibe, and although a decent joke, it tells us nothing about why stevelabny doesn't like their show, and it doesn't help someone who is on the fence about investing their time in trying a new show make a decision.
People shouldn't feel like their opinions aren't worth expressing because they are negative.
&gt;Yeah, and is it any wonder that I want to fire 50% of people who call me? 
You want to fire customers? 
I think I need to address you at a core level.
I get it, you're the salty, take no shit, say what's on your mind gun guy, and you reserve a certain pride to hold that archetype. I am guessing you care less about being a good ambassador of the hobby or even being a good salesman, than you do about filling this self-made role. And so let me say the only thing I think might get through to you.
Your rants are tired and unoriginal. You make it hard for the reader to have any sympathy for you. Most people are probably thinking: "Good, screw /u/FirearmConcierge and I hope he gets a hundred more dumb people making his life so difficult.". Some are thinking: "This guy again?". And some are thinking "Haha yeah! FC owned that faggot!" (I'm sure you know what age group the latter group belong to).
You come off as aggressive and 'holier-than-thou', a pretentiousness ground together with good ol' boy table manners. You don't paint yourself as someone we can relate to, which is a feat alone, considering that dealing with idiots is something everyone on the planet has had to endure. And yet, in your endeavors we can't even feel for you because we all dislike you just a little more than the idiots who vex you. 
I'm sure you get a lot of hate, but never mind that for now. I want to talk about realities for a minute. You know the old trope "You're lucky this is all on the internet because if I met you in real life I'd kick your ass!"? Well that doesn't apply here. If I met you in real life; if you and I were seated near each other, let's say at a bar, and you turned to me and told this story I'd probably find a different seat. 
That's because you come off as an intolerable prick, and if that's your goal you have met it completely. But what then, besides a sick need for attention, would drive you to submit your thoughts and stories to a public forum? I think you want to be edgy enough, just enough of an asshole to piss off the majority of people (who you, once their disdain for you is known, will view as beneath you) and be buddies with the ones who either buy into your social construct, or are too afraid of looking like squares to call you out on what you are: lame.
So having said that, I want to let you know that I've heard variations of this same story told around smoke shacks and in chow halls and in bars and everywhere else enough to know either it happened differently than how you are telling it, or that it didn't happen at all. I'm not worried which it is, but I'm saying if your goal is to be edgy and offensive and wrathful, please switch up the scenarios so that I won't see the outcome from a mile away. Also, please take a creative writing class. Your prose could use some polishing, which I think might go a long way with gaining and retaining readers. "Yeah, he's a prick, but hey, at least it's well written."
** your storytelling is tired and the archetype you portray is weak and 2 dimensional.**
i play esper and would love to play test vs this. The manabase is a problem of ester (having a W/U scry-land in BotG will help a lot!), but it is the most versatile. and especially with elspeth and detention sphere its better suited to deal with weenie. ashiok is kinda week as well, as he only acts as mill imho. Jace, Memory Adept does that job much better ;)
 I love Dimir from the lore side of things, but Esper is just way better. I don't think it will change to much in BotG.
I told this story in a different post but it will work here.
A few years ago when i was a lad a friend of mine got jumped by a cougar (and not the two legged kind either) and all he had was a bb gun so he shot it with that, luckily his pomeranian came along and saved the day but everyone knew there was a cougar in the area.
so anyways i was scared to death of geting killed by a cougar so one night my mother asks me to dump some bad food in the ditch, as was one of my evening chores. It was in the fall so it had already gotten dark, my dad sees me goes out and sneaks outside as I dump the rotten food i turn around to walk back. My dad makes a perfect cougar yowl and scare the shit out of me, i break into a run that would have made Ussain bolt go whoa, Ill have what he's havin, but im running towards my Dad whos hiding near the house so when he yowls again, IT SOUNDED EVEN CLOSER! My fear kicked into overdrive and I booked it into the house stammering to my mother that there was a cougar out there. then my Dad knocked on the window with the biggest smile on his face. FML
 My dad scared me to death by sounding like a cougar.

I might be alone here, but for me one of the things that makes "Frozen" so great is that few if any have dealt with the idea of depression and anxiety as they did with Elsa. Throughout her entire life she has had to hide this secret away from everyone else because she fears what she and other people would do if they found out about her secret. Going back to the idea of depression and anxiety, this is the way a lot of people with these problems feel, they have to hide away their problems because they don't want anyone else to know, or they have to "conceal don't feel." And in this Elsa is practically a role model for them, not only is she attractive but she also demonstrates how "let go" of her problems and not care about what other people think. Now since reddit is mainly consisted of teenage to middle aged men, quite a few of these redditors deal with problems such as depression or anxiety, even if not on a huge scale, like me. Because so people on here feel this way, frozen is a way for them to get away and realize that they need to break free from their problems in almost every song, "for the first time in forever," "let it go," ect. In closing, I might be wrong in a few things I said, but this is my personal view on you question.
ice powers = depression
That question always opens a can of worms. The best thing to do would be play both classes and figure out which you like most and +30 that role. IF you are going to play both evenly, 30 INT is more important to a SMN than 30 MND is for a SCH. 15/15 isn't a great option. Healing is FAR more about skill/timing than it is about overall stats (obviously, to an extent...). 
 30 INT &gt; 30 MIND if playing both. If you just want to play SCH, obviously go 30 MIND.
Not everything posted here is going to be for everyone who reads here. Some people are interested in advocacy, others in activism, others need to wean themselves off the regressive idea that women are somehow more noble or morally pure than men. Considering the relentless drumbeat of anti-male bias on screens, in print and on the street, there needs to be at least *one* place that attempts a partial counterbalancing narrative. By no means are you required to be personally familiar with each and every instance posted.
TL/DR: Some people need 'em. You don't like 'em? Don't read 'em.
I can answer 3. 
There is not much duplication of effort between rights-holding broadcasters (BBC, CBC, NHK etc.) as all footage of the actual competition is produced by OBS (Olympic Broadcasting Services), which is owned by the IOC and now handles all Summer, Winter and Youth Olympic and Paralympic games. In fact, there are certain groups of countries (most of the EBU for example, and much of Latin America for another) who even pool their resources in the commentary, interview, editorial aspects as well. 
OBS becomes the world's largest content producer for 2 weeks every summer games. In order to pull it off they contract various broadcasters to produce the coverage for each event. So for example, in 2012 the BBC produced the football and rowing, the Chinese the table tennis, the Belgians the cycling, Basketball by the Israelis and so on. The venue broadcast systems are set up and maintained by OBS contractors and are multi-national within each venue. OBS also provides the mix zones (post-sport interviews with athletes as they leave the field of play), commentary positions etc as well as their own interviews and 24hr rolling news network for broadcasters who can't afford to send a full complement of correspondents.
Obviously each broadcaster is going to want to ask different questions, so CBC will want to talk to mostly Canadian athletes, the BBC will want Team GB, and will also expect the favourite to win / world champion, NBC don't care about anyone who isn't on the US team. So there isn't true duplication in their interviews, commentary etc.
Now. NBC is the real exception. Even though OBS produces full coverage of the event with the International Feed, NBC has decided that it wants to make it themselves. They bring their own cameras, satellite trucks - basically duplicating 1-for-1 the cameras that the rest of the world gets. They have the capacity to produce their own coverage without relying on OBS. This is unique, and it costs NBC a hell of a lot ($200m for 2012). But the American public only want close-ups of the US athletes. So NBC have to do it themselves. You may have noticed during the Opening Ceremony this year, only one team had cameramen actually among the athletes walking out into the stadium. Yup, that was an NBC cameraman.
While most broadcasters are fairly friendly on the Olympics (except the N Koreans), the NBC contingent are often pretty distant, in part because of their segregated coverage. They are the only broadcaster to post security guards outside their studio area in the International Broadcast Centre. And because they don't bother with the Paralympics, they rip out their cables, leaving everyone else's in a mess.
 Most countries pool resources in some way and the IOC provides all the coverage of the actual sport, with the footage being neutral in terms of athlete's country. The exception is NBC, who produce the sport footage themselves to concentrate overwhelmingly on US athletes.

the game has been over since the 6th minute. we aren't looking to score very hard, we're just keeping the ball away from atletico and recovering it quickly.
 dominating, pateti can't do shit.
oh i have a few.
1.) walking out of a friends condo in 3 am after celebrating their birthday. As i open the door and step outside a guy was walking about 10-15 feet in front of me. A gunman gets out of a nearby car and shoots the guy walking in in the back 4 times. I dive for cover outside the door the window above me shattering as the gun man fired to keep witnesses down. - This happened in Canada, hand gun violence is pretty rare ( i had never heard a gun go off before)
2.) motorcycling one day on a major highway 3 lanes in both directions, im in the fast lane doing 130-140 km in traffic. Driving as i should be, keeping a nice space, paining attention. Suddenly the car in front of me (driver was not paying attention jams on his brakes as traffic was slowing to a crawl in front of him. I lock up my brakes, front and back. The thing is, that on motorcycles the back tires often only have one brake so the bick pulls to that side, im basically going down the highway at 140 with my brakes locked and my bike is in an L shape as the back tire is sideways. i come to a stop finally, still sideways a few feet behind the car in front of me... i had the piece of mind while going sideways that if i was going to run out of space i was going to have to gun it and try and go between cars of between the car and the center median.
3.) motorcycling again: my dad is in front of me on his bike, my mom is behind us, the short story is that 5 deer ran out in front of my dad, he crashes into them causing one to flip around the front of his bike. the other 4 go in the air and i have to dodge them as they fall around me.. never got hit, got really lucky.

tl, dr : survived a random shooting, survived locking up my motorcycle brakes at 140 km,while motorcycling survived the bike in front of me throwing deer into the air and dodging them as they fall...
pretty sure if i had any luck, its gone now
It really depends on where it is.
Yes, ice is a factor, but there are some school districts, particularly in the southern states, that will close when it gets cold, even if there's no ice.
For example, the Oklahoma City School District will [close schools]( if it gets below 10, or the wind chill gets below 5 -- even if there's no ice. The reason is because days that cold are pretty rare, and there's many children who simply don't have warm enough outerwear. Many kids have to wait a long time outside for a school bus to arrive.
It's unusual to have a school closing only because of cold, but it happened just this week in OKC. But that's a district, not a state, policy. Neighboring districts were open.
- it depends on the local school district.
Oh I don't condone my action at all. I just didn't understand some concepts that were being tested at the time and I had run out of time to know them. I studied even after my final and learned what I didn't know but I didn't want to hurt my grade just because I hadn't grasped them yet. My end goal was more important to me than my legitimacy on that test, I ended up learning what I didn't know later which is the important part in the long run of schooling and failing that test may have caused me more trouble with my schooling by stressing me out with extra work having to retake a whole class when it was just a few small concepts I hadn't quite grasped at the time. Its good for the students who figured it out sooner but I hadn't. I don't think it effects much of anything either since soon after the test I grasped what I wasn't ready for by the test. I knew I needed to learn those concepts because it wasn't going to be my last math class, or time using math. If I had understood the concepts by the test I wouldn't have any need to cheat but I ran out of time so screw it, I earned my grade by putting in the extra effort later the other students earned their grade by understanding some things before I did. It's not like I didn't put in effort for that class, I just wasn't as fast.
- test are dumb, we put too much focus on testing in education instead of on learning. As soon as my country learns this our education scores will jump significantly.
Whatever you do, DO NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER!
Rogers is very well known for being a very, very bad business and is terrible with their customer relations. Any business that is affiliated with Rogers, such as Fido or any other company, are all tainted by Roger's incompetence. Their customer service is terrible about 8 times out of 10 and the few times that it is good, it's passable, but barely. I have had a couple times where i probably could have taken Rogers to court over the customer serivice alone and won. Too bad i didn't have the time or money to do such a thing. 
The only time that rogers is a good choice, is if you are living up in an area in alberta north of Edmonton. For some reason, Telus (Equally as bad as Rogers.) cannot for the life of them figure out how to get good quality cell reception up there, but continue to claim they have the best service anywhere. Rogers actually beat them time and time again up there when i was living in Fox Creek. If you can just get Bell/Virgin or something else, avoid Rogers, and definitely avoid Telus. 
If you are in saskatchewan, just pony up the security fund they ask for. It's worth it in the end, especially if you are doing your job as a customer and paying on time. Enough on time payments and that security fund will be credited to your account, or if you are persistant enough, as they WILL try to avoid this, you can get your money back as actuall cash instead.
TL.DR
Don't use Rogers. Don't use Telus. Whatever you do, DO NOT use their affiliate companies. You will get screwed around by both, but your gonna get screwed harder by the affiliates. And if you don't have something better to use. Get Bell/Virgin mobile.
T/R and kickr integration is quite good, especially if you are using with their workouts/training plan.  For example, when you are doing the 20 min test FTP test, T/R will control the kickr through the warmup and when it is time for your 20 min test it will automatically switch into resistance mode at the start of the test so you can go as hard as you can.   
Like others have said, the best feature of the kickr is that you can set it and forget it and just follow the prompts.  The T/R team is pretty responsive and are actively improving their product.  If you don't have an iphone or ipad, T/R is pretty much the only way to control the kickr. 
I have one of these [stands]( where I have my laptop that runs T/R.  It's not a great stand but it's cheap and gets the job done.  I also love this [fan](  The remote control is really handy for turning on/off and controlling the speed. 
 kickr is a great trainer and if you are looking to train with power, it is worthwhile investment.  T/R is a great way of controlling the kickr, especially if you don't have an iPhone or iPad. 
Exhaust doesn't have to be loud to be free flowing, which is where the horsepower gains come from.  My 2008 STI is putting down 364HP/340TQ to the wheels on a Mustang Dyno with the stock catback and a Cobb catted downpipe (plus a bigger turbo, equal length headers, etc).  The car is hardly any louder than stock.  My tuner felt that I would have gained 20HP tops by spending all the extra dough on a catback exhaust.  And since I was going to be aiming for a quiet catback anyway that $1500 for 20HP wasn't worth it.  While I kind of miss the noise sometimes (vs the turbo back exhaust I had on my 2004), it's sweet to be able to do 75mph on the freeway and still hear the radio.  It also makes for a real sleeper because externally it looks and sounds stock.
TLDR - Horesepower comes from a free flowing exhaust, not a loud one.
why are you building a pc? if you are building because you want to play video games, buy a graphics card now, but build it right away anyway and install it when it arrives.
If you built your computer for internet and pirating and storage and school work just build it and keep your eyes on deals that may pop up for a good graphics card.
tldr build it now
If you wait til around this time next year and buy a phone that is Multi/Tri-Band LTE, Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) capable, has a replaceable battery, Android-based, and a well supported open-source community, then you *may* be able to get beyond 5 years.  At least in the U.S., carriers will most likely phase out CDMA/GSM after 4 years from now making current phones useless.
I have a 4 year old phone that has good open-source community support and I'm running [CyanogenMod]( (a third-party Android OS) and except for CPU, GPU, memory, and 4G LTE support, its like a new phone.
The reason carriers want to migrate to newer technologies is because they can redeploy wireless spectrum, being used by fewer customers on older phones, to newer wireless technology that uses their precious spectrum more efficiently while also customers benefit from better service.
LTE combined with VoLTE and eventually LTE-Advanced are the wireless technologies for the next 10 years.
*** Most likely not because phones are cheap and carriers/customers benefit from the latest technologies, but it might be possible with the next wave of LTE-based wireless tech and long-term third-party Android OS updates.
**EDIT:** To answer your question directly, the phone is probably going to be a multi-band LTE phone like the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S4 refresh or S5 if their battery remains user replaceable.
I work with embedded systems though... I stand by the statement most modern phones are unnecessarily powerful, to appeal to the market demands. 
People want more GHz and cores. 
The early iPhones were considerably faster than their Android counterparts, back even in the days of single core devices... 
I still feel every phone on the market is overpowered. I think about the amount which can be done by well written, well optimised, native code. When working with microcontrollers, you have a single core, most often in the single or double figures of MHz clock speeds. This makes you write better code. An operating system is a luxury on them... 
When you look at Android, they appear to have lost touch with embedded systems. Much as I like Linux, it's a kernel for the desktop. The need for Android to add power management backs this. I do believe if a kernel was properly made for Android, with the intention from the start of mobile use in a limited power environment, battery life and performance would be significantly better. 
An embedded engineer wouldn't have a job if he produced code like that in android - even rendering a view when loading an app is an incredibly slow process, resulting in layouts and views being expanded in multiple sequential run-throughs. 
If I was designing something from scratch, I'd have to optimise the view construction, so it happened in a single simple step. Ideally in native code rather than java. 
Unfortunately though, Android is simply not an embedded operating system like the true embedded systems. Since phones now have gigabytes of memory, and ridiculously powerful CPUs, inefficient software is tolerated or even encouraged. 
Look at an HTC HD2 running Windows phone 7, and look at an android phone from 2 years later... The HD2 will be smoother despite running an operating system it wasn't intended for, being 2 years older. That's the benefit of native code being run, rather than Android's obscure object oriented java implementation that would rather do everything in loops, rather than just do it right first time... 
Edit to add: When you compare the functions your snapdragon 800 device performs, compared to your HTC G1 or hero, I can't really argue the modern phone does significantly more. 
Let's overlook gaming, since that's about Gpu. The phone still browses websites, and makes calls, and runs apps that show the weather and tell us the time, and play our music. The hero was a single core 528 MHz core. Do you feel you get proportionally improved performance in these same tasks, compared to that? I believe as devices get faster, the code we run on them gets slower and sloppier and less optimised, as it's easy to get it to run at the same speed as before. 
To give a concrete example, what's the deal with SwiftKey? It was really smooth back on my hero, and my s2 to a point. Within the last year or two though, it's got much slower... I can't blame the hardware as it has been constant. I have tried the newer version on the older devices, and it's much slower. Therefore I suggest the actual applications itself is slower than the old version. Sure this is just one person's opinion of one app, but I know many others who agree with the SwiftKey issues indeed I think it's high on their list of bugs, despite little to no improvement in years. If anything it's slower for me. 
my phone still does the same tasks, pretty much, but has many times the raw computing power. Apps that still do the same task are updated, and end up even slower than they used to be on older hardware. Welcome to my frustration with android...
Lol. infamous big? The first 2 games were good but not great. This one looks like the same with a new skin. It will probably only sell well because PS4 has no other games to play. Meanwhile Titanfall is so hyped, so blindingly front and center everywhere that you have to be living under a rock not to know about it. 
Titanfall is going to sell A LOT. 
Lots of /r/bigboobproblmes in here.
Check it. I can see my sternum and count all of my ribs. I'm an A cup, or whatever, not that I care about bras, because they literally do nothing for me. My nipples are sensitive so I wear a bra. Basically boobs are soft lumps with hard cherries on top.
More and more clothes are made for women with cleavage, which turns into a spotlight for my one-man sternum show. Wearing "push-up" bras means having to pull them down and under and fighting an underwire (WHY?).
Anything womanly made for thin and petite-chested women are astronomically priced (see banana republic, J Crew, Ann Taylor's The Loft, NY and Co., White House Black Market).
The "petite" section of any large-scale department stores are actually not very petite at all, with plenty of chestroom.
In fact EVERYTHING is scaled toward "average" sized women, so small is more like a medium, etc, and I end up buying underwear in the "juniors" section.
 Boobs are things other people (have to) care about.
Edit: oh I'm sorry did I piss in the big tits jerk? My bad. I forgot that since I have small tits I don't get to have a voice about them. Either that or this is overflow from ABTF. Cheers ladies, one more female sub to un follow.
You have to include topdoge in your comment you TLDR shibe 
Not sure if anyone would care but I have a story. 
Also sort of making a throwaway account due to not wanting this to come back and bite me in the ass. 
Being in computer security classes taught me a little about making viruses and how they work. At this time botting was everywhere, and the Runescape buddy client was extremely popular. Sick of the botting I thought I’d make a new account to play with.
  
I set up a YouTube channel advertising scripts that you normally had to pay for free. a popular one was a bot or script that would do dungeoneering. I made a very convincing video but all it did was put a rat (remote admin tool) on the pc and never worked. I used it to collect the password, because they were all using bots there pins where stored in the Runescape buddy client in a plain text file.  Making it easy to get into their bank accounts and take their stuff.
  
This went on for a good month, ended up being a lot of fun. I had practically unlimited money. I gave it away, diced, and had drop parties in the party room. Accumulating several rares and a max cash stack, I considered myself a robin hood only targeting people botting. 

Then one day bank standing at the grand exchange, the account auto logged out and was perm banned for account hijacking. Surprised but not sad, I never got the temptation to give any money to my main account, Ever. My main did get locked but it was likely due to them following my IP address. That made me very nervous because I didn't want it to affect my main and made sure they never interacted.
 
I stopped after that. I even emailed Jagex an apology letter but I never did get a response back. It was a fun learning experience but I don’t recommend doing it. You can get in a lot of trouble. 

There was one instance ill never forget where I caught someone scamming someone saw the whole thing happen. Kicked the guy off and gave him the stuff back and told them he needs to find new friends. Id give more info about that if anyone is interested but it’s already a lot of typing. 

– Robbed from the cheating, gave to the poor. Got caught, and it ended. 
I still don't get why they use the word privilege as such a terrible, horrible insult?
I (maybe foolishly?) studied Sociology when I was in undergrad. It's where all the pretty girls were and very few guys, and it had a Public Health concentration that I was interested in. Anyways, it's common for certain groups and people to have privileges, because not everybody is exactly the same. That's how life works. Having a privilege is not, in of itself, a terrible condemnation on the person you are. What you do with that privilege or how you act IS a determining factor of who you are.
I'm a white, heterosexual male who grew up in upper-middle class and I have been able to become educated through my hard work and the support of my family, financial or otherwise. I have privileges that other people do not, but I don't hold those over others, because I realize that it just means I need to work harder to deserve the good fortune I have. Instead, I try to learn from others, treat all people kindly and respectfully, and do the best I can with what tools I have to make the world a better place.
Most tumblrinas would tell me I'm a horrible person because I have a privilege and dare to try to learn from others. Based on that, I don't think even they really understand what they're trying to do.
- I don't understand why is privilege such a terrible thing?
[This is why I hate non-binaries who demand special pronouns. Special snowflakes to the core.](
...
[Someone even got upset at me for saying that should accept reality and not demand personalized pronouns--they dared to compare their pronouns with binary trans people's issues.](
Cause', ya know, binary trans people are totally trying to redefine the English language by asking for 100 new ways to identify zxemselves.
 Kay, I don't care if you're nonbinary or whatever, so long as you don't demand your stupid pronouns.
Hello!
So I checked out the video, it was a bit short, I didn't get as much conclusive evidence as I had wished for.
Its really hard to classify as the video was a bit too short for me to judge properly. It looks like it could be either spawn camping, or spawn trapping.
Here's a post I did on spawn trapping, and how it could be against the code of conduct:
&gt; Lets pretend you and I are playing Mortal Kombat II on the Sega Genesis, I'm Scorpion and you're Sub-zero...
We start the game, I use my spear and yell "Get over here!" in a daze Sub-zero is yanked in Scorpions direction, I jump over you, pin you against the wall, then I repeatedly do a low sweep kick, causing you Sub-zero to trip, stand up, trip...
Now imagine anything you try, you can't execute. We end the match, Scorpion gets a flawless victory.
When playing Ghosts online, players are encouraged to play fair, have fun and be respectful to other players. Action is taken on players who violate the spirit of the game. SL
However, there are different situation in which my colleague ^MD and I answer questions on the subject [in this post.]( 
We also cite this reddit post Infinity Ward made awhile back, outlining the differences between spawn camping/spawn trapping, and how a player can get banned for spawn trapping [(please see this link for full details)](
 "Spawn trapping" is a bannable offence. "Spawn camping" is not. This information is based off [these examples.](
I hope I was able to answer your question properly /u/crioth
Thank you. ^SL
I'm by no means an expert on this subject, other than hundred of hours in Minecraft playing with redstone (which is actually a great introduction to binary and logic operators), but this is how I'd explain it in layman's terms.
Binary is 0's and 1's. Imagine a wire. If there is a current running through it it is 1, if there is none it is 0. This is called the wire's *state*.
Logic gates are devices that takes input from one or more of these wires and outputs another wire.
Take for example the very simple AND gate. AND gates will only output 1 if all input is 1.
**AND gate**
| Input A   | Input B    | Output     |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 0        |         0|    0     
| 1  |   0| 0   
|0  |       1|   0
|1|1|1     
Maybe your house has two light switches that control the same light? Ever wondered how you press the first one to On position and the light turns on, and then you press the other one, also to the On position and the light turns off. Let me introduce the XOR gate, which only outputs 1 if one, and ONLY one input is 1 (XOR = *exclusive or*)
**XOR gate**
| Input A | Input B | Output |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|0|0|0
|1|0|1
|0|1|1
|1|1|0
In this example imagine that the input is the light switches and the output is the lamp.
There are many different kinds of logic gates, this is just the surface. You can read more on Wikipedia  . 
 Logic gates take binary input, do so some logic operations and puts out binary output.
Simple answer to this. 
First off, this Michael stuff is irrelevant. Stop making yourself upset about that, it's not helping.
Secondly, let her go. If she's sure about you, then you'll be together in 9 months. Hell, maybe YOU will change and not want to be with her.
You have 9 months to do whatever you want to do and if at the end of it, you still want to be with her, and she wants to be with you, then you'll find out she was sincere and your relationship with probably flourish.
If not, then you'll know it was all bullshit, and you'll not have wasted anymore time with someone who wasn't as serious about you as you were them.
- Wait 9 months. See what happens. SURPRISE.
So I'm in my local used game/CD store getting making my purchases when one of the clerks looks at me and asks, "Hey man, how'd your brain surgery go?"
I had one of those long pauses where you replay in your mind what was just said to make sure you heard it right because, to the best of my knowledge, I've never had brain surgery.  I finally decided I had heard him right and responded "I think you have me confused with someone else."
Oddly the clerk got one of those looks like I was confusing him now.  He said, "Yeah your wife was in the other day and she said you'd had brain surgery."
At the time I wasn't married and said so.  The clerk, looked at me and said something like "are you sure?"  I sort of shrugged, payed for my games, and left.
 Maybe my brain surgery went very badly.
To be entirely honest, the magical defence category for supports is rather lacking. The unfortunate truth is that magical defence items simply dont provide the same level of utility that physical defence items do (i.e. no aura damage/aura protections/speed from witch stone) so a true support really cannot build heavily magical defence. That said, /u/acipere above has a solid build that will make you more magically defensive and still maintain some utility as a support with maximum cdr and cc reduction for baiting cc and such.
Edit: also keep in mind that building health will make you way tankier, Soveregnity for example will actually provide a far greater benefit then one might expect because 1. 650 health is huge and 2. the aura applies to yourself so it actually does give +20 magical defense. Also Etheral Staff is a very very situational item for tanks, its passive of 2% of you health becoming magical power combined with a ton of mana and health will make you become a far scarier opponent as all the sudden, you freezes and carpets will be hitting pretty hard and +600 health will help with both magical and physical opponents. Bulwark can also be picked up, but as a tank you lose out on a lot of the utility of its passive as you aren't scared of burst damage anways, idol of concentration is a great pick with some cdr and more frequent damage mitigation. Winged wand is also another great item as it will help prevent enemies from zoning you away from your squishys and provides a solid amount of health that no tank should scoff at, it's cheep, it has a bit of cdr, a bit of move speed and some health and a sweet passive so keep that one in mind.
look at the health category too! it also helps vs. magical defense.
My mother divorced my Dad, drugged me up after being diagnosed with ADHD. After she couldn't handle me she sent me to live with my father.
Oh she divorced him because he hit her. So yay, great things coming my way.
Dad beats me with a belt at least twice a week. Several times to the point where I couldn't sit down. If you haven't been spanked till your ass is completely bruised... Yeah. Torture is a more relevant term.
So my Mom finds out about this after a few years and takes me back one Christmas. Oh, guess what? I'M A RAGING PSYCHOPATH NOW! I don't have the adhd symptoms, but I like to hurt people. I'm also weird as fuck because I attended a Christian school.
Mom can't handle me, go figure, and sends me BACK to live with my Dad. It's like... as long as she doesn't have to see it it's ok.
Same old shit happens except this time my Dad takes the extra step to homeschool me. So I get extra quality time with this asshole. Oh and now he has me working as a roofer for $2.50 an hour. In mother fucking FLORIDA. Try heat index of 140 on the roof in summer.
So beatings happen, I'm getting brainwashed into Christianity like you wouldn't believe. 
Somehow I end up back with my Mom. My brain is fucked for this whole period of my life so I don't remember why. After about two months I put my younger brother in the hospital with a bat. 
Yup. Back to live with Dad. He finally throws me out while I'm trying to finish high school. Move back home with my Mom at the threat of being homeless and join the military.
The ARMY undid a lot of the damage, and grew me up fast. I wrote off the half of my family that knew what was going on with my Dad. I still love my Mom. 
If you don't want to die old and alone with no one to hold your hand as you die, don't... beat... your... kids.
I've told this story before but I'll tell it again. I was given Sapphire from my brother for my birthday. My first play through of it I did not look up the plot line or cheats or anything else about the game. I wanted to experience it like the first time I played Blue. I got to the part where you teach Wally to catch a Pokemon and of course he got Ralts. I saw it and decided I wanted one on my team and proceeded to catch one. Long story short; it evolved into a Kirlia with the ability Mirage. ("Able to make mirages appear" was the description.) It never had any effect in battle and I thought nothing of it when it evolved into Gardevoir while I was in Lilycove. Eventually I got to Pacificlog, learned about Mirage Island, and cried. Tried looking up about the game after that only to find there are no records of a Kirlia with Mirage existing. And it's almost impossible to find anything that isn't a Pokedex entry because it's the "Mirage Pokemon". 
Best answer I've every found for what happened was my game accessed code that should have been deleted. Like the developers were going to have Mirage as an ability then changed their minds. 
 Caught a Ralts, evolved it to a Kirlia with Mirage ability, evolved again at Lilycove, learned about Mirage Island later, now people call me a liar. :( 
Regardless, it's always a reply to "Dan's banned from [insert country]", which is also a bothersomely common phrase.

*I know*, *I know*, these phrases will eventually fade... only to be replaced by new ones.  I'm just voicing one of the few things that annoys me about the internet; whenever something gets popular, either in a community or internet-wide, everyone beats it into the ground until it's not funny or entertaining anymore.
Examples: Tay Zonday's Chocolate Rain, Keyboard Cat, PSY's Gangnam Style, Nyan Cat, videos of people falling over... yeah, all hammered into obscurity by people who obsessed over it.  That's not to say they weren't good or entertaining-- but it's kind of like when you love a song, then you play it over and over until you hate it; it's essentially the same principal, except it's NerdCubed and it's more of an in-joke... a very *tired* in-joke at this point.

'Banned from many places" is not a catchphrase. THESE are catchphrases:
Dan:
&gt;"Hello Procrastinators!" 
&gt;"Manchester United: Nil"
&gt;"Turrah!"

Steve (it was Steve, right? His father?)
&gt;"EEEEYAAAAAAHOOOOOO!!!!" 
&gt;"Hello everybody welcome back to Dadcubed-- Yeah, the old man from Essex is back again" 
&gt;"Byyyyeee!!" 

It seems a bit pretentious to have a 'community catchphrase'; when have you ever heard of a community having a catchphrase? Never!
Even the word is described as thus:
&gt;a well-known sentence or phrase, typically one that is associated with a particular famous person.
Well, dan's *kinda* famous-- not sure if that's a stretch, but he *is* well known.  We're not celebrities, nowhere near. Dan's certainly much closer to that, and that's why he has a catchphrase (well, multiple)

I am making *way* too big of a deal out of this.  I need to go to bed, I'm getting grumpy.  Don't take my bit the wrong way, I'm just sassy for some reason. Argumentative, yeah, that's the word. Or moronic... you could go with that.

***: Just pretend I'm a duck, then suddenly nothing I say matters and you've no reason to take me seriously, no matter how much sense I try to make. Also, you may notice that this has nothing to do with what I've said; spot on-- good eye :D
I love that  :D
I dunno, I don't particularly care for most electronic or hip hop albums. I grew up generally listening to punk-ish music, so I always had a weird aversion to both the genres. However, as my music taste began to expand I gained a little interest in both the genres. I am not too familiar with either, but you mentioned both Macklemore and The Knife as MOR and Disclosure and Blackstar as more fringe things. From those examples I would definitely be more interested in fringe stuff, and it is probably just because it is more interesting to me. I originally listened to punk music because I was tired of mainstream music at the time - so my interest in more fringe stuff is probably just an extension of that. The MOR stuff just isn't interesting enough for me I guess. 
 Punk music growing up made me crave interesting music, which in turn led me in the direction of fringe artists in Hip Hop/Electronic.
I prefer to play on Deity with only a military victory enabled and here is the general starting strat that will put you in a position to build your empire at all levels.
1. Take that first warrior you begin with and move it out to explore in the direct vicinity of your city.  Think going out to the 3 hex city founding limit and do a complete circuit around.  You will find at least one barbarian encampment this way as well as a good view of your closest available luxury for city founding.
  a.  Attack your barbarian encampment only when you are above 70% health with your warrior (in the Green).  Use the alert command to heal for one turn and pop right back over there instead of standing to full heal.  Usually you'll get 1 to 2 spawns of the encampment.  By the time you've cleared it up you'll have a lvl 4 warrior.  Do not ride straight towards March(heals every turn no matter what).  Use those promotions to get both levels of your medic ability and then decide if you want to go for march.  I recommend first promotion for rough terrain, but the map should dictate this.
  b.  DO NOT EXPLORE WITH YOUR WARRIOR.  The harder the difficulty and if you are playing with raging barbarians will ensure that an exploring warrior will end your game with a captured capital.
2.  First thing you build is a worker.  Every civ, every game, every time.  Being able to build in your territory is crucial.  This worker is the foundation of your entire game.  Have it run back to the city if you get even a whiff of barbarians.  It is possible to recover from losing your first worker, but requires a ton of luck at higher difficulties.
  a.  Unit building is your first objective.  After the worker build a Scout then another Warrior.  At this point you should have grown in population and it's time to build that first Settler!  Move that settler out to the closest new luxury resource that you have found with your circling warrior and found the city.  Don't worry too much about happiness at this point, growth and production are key.
  b.  After the founding of your 2nd city, it's time to focus on your capital stats.  Unless your are rushing for Wonders, your main focus will be on three areas: Science, Culture, Faith.  All things being equal, the civ with the highest science output will win the game every time.  Access to better units and structures guarantee this.  Culture and Faith are important because they are 'Hard' statistics.  What that means is that they do not scale, they are what they are no matter how big your city or empire becomes.  Science will continue to increase no matter what as long as you have gold.  Gold will fluctuate up and down depending on city size, unit counts and area development.  Happiness will continue to decline.  Culture becomes more and more valuable as the game progresses as each advancement costs more.  The benefits of cultural policies are incomparable with all other aspects of the game.  Cultural dominance is secondary to Science, but since it won't just grow in it's own it takes constant effort to increase.
3.  Research and all the fun science has to offer!  What do you research first?  You'll be tempted by Wonders and units and buildings.  You'll want to go for whatever technology is needed to access your available luxury resources. But the vital first technology is Writing.  That library is the most important thing to have built in your city.  Not too mention while your researching this you'll quickly have access to the shrine and granary, giving you more than enough building options until the research is finished.  I almost always go balls out for building the Great Library wonder as soon as the technology is researched as the free tech is an awesome boost.  Even if someone else builds it first, the gold amount is comparatively massive in early game and can make up for lost time buying units that you could have been building.
That is about all you need to start off strong.  One last tip that I have found makes my marathon/deity games more enjoyable early is war.  After meeting other civs, you are bound to be invited to declare war on someone.  Do it.  Until you get to the point where you are actively planning out an empire road network and deciding which civs stand in your way agree to declare war every time.  The potential gains that you will receive during the peace negotiations can take a frightfully inadequate civilization and turn it into a strong powerhouse earlier than can be expected.
 Build a goddamn worker and expand fast.
This is the NCDGC here. 
As an employee of the National Collegiate Disc Golf Championships and as the president of my university's club team, I have had many wonderful experiences playing collegiate disc golf. It is a lot of fun to travel to tournaments, build camaraderie and friendships with your teammates, and the competition is top-notch!
 
I am not aware of any competitive teams at any of those schools you listed but that should not stop you from starting one!
Starting a club at any university is going to have its challenges and each school's process will be different but it will be worth every bit of the effort!
If you're interested in starting a team, check here for more info: 
We also have qualifiers all across the nation and a complete listing of collegiate events can be found here: 
We wish you the best of luck with your collegiate disc golf career and maybe one day we’ll see you at National Collegiate Disc Golf Championships!
 Playing collegiate disc golf is awesome and it doesn’t matter if there is a team or not, start your own.
Not my sink and not my house. But. I was on holiday a few years ago. Our room had a kitchen areas with a large hot plate to cook on. We came back from our evening out and our door wouldn't unlock with the key card.  After trying for a few seconds I tried it without the key card then tried it lifting the handle up and I discovered that our door would open without the key if you lifted the handle. 
Anyway. We went to bed, both relatively sober as were not big drinkers. Next morning, woke up to the smell of vomit. Looked everywhere bT couldn't find it. As I went to get a glass of water I noticed the hot plate was completely covered in nasty chunky vomit. It didn't belong to either of us. 
Some stranger came into our hotel room in the middle of the night and puked all over our hot plate. 
Hello! :) last month ko lang ito na-discover :) 
I've been looking for bar stools for almost 5 months but they've always seemed unreasonably priced at P3K to P4K. I've checked literally everywhere and it's priced similarly be it Wilcon, SM, Home Depot, specialty stores, etc. So I found this place alongside Aurora blvd. They have bar stools that are EXACTLY the ones they sell in Dimensione at P3,800++ but they sell at JUST P1,800!! So of course I bought two.
I saw desks, closets, bookshelves, side tables, office tables, etc. there as well. In fact, I purchased the exact same office chair as my boyfriend but LESS P1,600.  
You can check their online store (the name of the place is Nemie Furniture) to know first what piece you are actually interested in. But the whopping discounts are given in store. They drop prices at the THOUSANDS.  
Medjo rock and roll yung place kasi dusty and bodega-ish. But that's it. Yung sa Aurora friendly yung staff and the owners are there conducting the business themselves. Meron din silang bigger selection sa kanilang mga binders. You can be assured of product because they have to call sa factory to have it delivered. Trade-off is you wait 3-days. But that's it: Super awesome discounts, same product, also they deliver. :) 
 Products you see in the mall for half the price. Nemie Furniture.
I'll try to do what the article didn't explain:   
   
SystemD and UpStart are different systems in how the OS starts, manages, and stops running services.
The whole reasoning behind this debate is becuase something as basic as this can cause major problems down the road. Systems running newer versions will have different bugs than the other, and can be a nightmare to fix for both.   
Another factor is pride. A good number of Debian developers made vast contributions to upstart. Seeing it thrown away is an insult to their work, which is enough for them to want to resign.   
it controls how things boot up and is very important   
   
PS: i'm not well educated in this, but I used what I've learned
EDIT: fixed definition of init systems
&gt; Conversation ensued about which president you'd be--I'd be JFK, of course.
I don't know how to say this, but JFK's term didn't end very well.  
&gt; "Dude, that girl was ugly. I give you no credit for talking to them, she's fucking engaged. You got nothing out of it, what a joke."
This is just bitch talk.  The fact is, society teaches guys that their value is tied up in the type of women they can "pull."  So guys get very emotional and defensive when its clear that you have a skill at getting girls that they don't.  That's why so many guys get douchey and defensive when they are criticized here on r/seddit. Your friend is just projecting his own fear and insecurities on you.  
You did great.  You had no idea those girls were engaged when you approach them and you still made some new friends.  That's awesome.  And also, if the engagements falls apart your dick will have first priority for her mouth.  
Being able to approach random people is a great skill to have.  If you move to a great city like New York or LA, you can meet a lot of really awesome, interesting people just by approaching.  When I lived in New York I would sometimes approach guys I thought looked interesting.  And I'm totes not gay.  I met a lot of really awesome, cool guys.  One night I met a guy who owned the largest tie company in America, and he invited me on his boat the next day to party with models.  It was awesome.  One night I thought I had a date with a girl and she brought a dude friend over.  Instead of getting angry, I befriended him and guess what -he invited me on a boat to party with models the next week!! 
In fact, there are some articles that say that one of the main reasons that women get paid less than men is that they never learn the art of approaching random strangers (in the dating world), so they are less likely to approach and ask for favors, raises, promotions, etc..., and they are shittier and finding new clients and business prospects. 
So, TLDR - you did well, fuck your friend. 
I hate treasure hunter. With SoF, I had to click less. Also I felt (perhaps inaccurately, but that doesn't really matter for my brain does it) that I had more control over my prize. I used the counting method, and I did get what I was aiming for more often than random chance. Counting in this way made it a game for me, something interesting.
In the new method, I have a choice between multiple boxes. It probably makes no difference which box I pick, but it stresses me out just the same. It's click intensive because I have to move my mouse to click a box. The graphics are messy. There's no hoping for the prize in the middle, no satisfaction if you get the prize for which you were aiming. It's just random.
Not everyone prefers Treasure Hunter.
(edit for profanity)
If it were say 18 v 18 you would die or kill someone around every corner having that many titans would be ridiculous just trying to movr around. For some reason everyone bashing the 6v6 doesn't seem to realize respawn put many hours into playing with the player count balance and eventually decided on 6v6 + AI. The game is fun as hell and obviously not too serious. People have been playing TF2 for years and it doesn't try to be competitive and entirely investment driven but it still has a huge player base and even though it's goofy and causal there is a huge competitive area of it aswhell. I don't get why every game that comes out needs to be entirely investment driven to keep people around. I'd much rather play a game because it's fun rather than because I want that awesome high level gun and because I need to win every match. This game is fun as all hell and I love every second of It even though it's casual as fuck.
Mother of god that's alot of words 
fuck you it's fun
After playing the Titanfall beta for the last few nights and not having played a competitive FPS on PC for a while I can confirm this. I have been getting my fuckin ass handed to me no matter which loadout I try. Most of the time I can get triple lock on a pilot with the auto-pistol and not be able to one-hit kill him. I get wrecked by people with the automatic rifles and shotguns.
 PC players are fuckin godly compared to plebes like me
I can't really control that in this forum, you are correct, but it really won't impact the major goals of the study. I actually have some more comment on why it will have little impact, but I can't post it here without giving away more about the study than I wish to disclose to potential participants. The major pieces are more contingent on factors other than student status, and student is required solely because of the limitations of a single measure. 
 not too worried about it for scientifically valid reasons. 
I appreciate your query! Thank you!
Both of my dragons don't seem to mind. There was some concern that my big boy Luca would see the brightly colored bird as food, but they just don't care. I have that little windowsill perch for the dragons, and the bird will hop over from his cage and talk to them/interact. Sivvi the cockatiel even tries to snag some of the food they are eating. When the small female dragon is up on the roost, they just seem to look out the window for hours. When it's Luca, the bird actively tries to interact with him, often ending with Luca looking very confused.
Example: 
They are adorable together
When I was a kid, my family had dial-up internet with a certain amount of hours included, and overages if we were on too long. He got this little program that kept track, and we created a .wav sound file that would let us know when that time had been reached. That sound file was my voice saying, "you're spending money, you know" and a few coins dropping onto a hard surface. I know he posted it on various forums for others to use, and that it was downloaded quite a bit for a file in the early 90's. When the computer died a few years later, the file was lost, and we never found it again. It's just a kid and some coins, but it had a special value to me, because it was the first time my dad and I had created something together with a computer.
- a sound file of me as a kid "You're spending money, you know [coins dropping]"
Oh god this goes even a little beyond the internet, but it would be amazing if someone could help me out.
So basically I, not unlike many other 5th/6th graders, was a huge fucking weaboo child. One day my cousin let me borrow a mix CD, and on that CD was the most amazing song my little ears had ever heard. In short, it was an extremely cheesy 90's-techno-esque mix of the Tatara womens' work song from Princess Mononoke. I fucking loved that song, and taped it to a little cassette tape on repeat for an entire side before I had to give the CD back. I listened to that fucking tape for hours of my life, but eventually (as tends to happen with weaboos) I grew out of it. 
About 2 years ago, I somehow remembered the song out of the blue and decided I had to find it. Surprisingly enough, I found it fairly easily in a youtube video but I unfortunately didn't get the title or artist written down. Added it to my favorites for a bit of nostalgia and went on with my life. 
Two more years pass, and here I am today. The youtube video has since been deleted and I've spent hours trying to find the song again, but to no avail. 
 I need to re-find a certain "techno" remix of the Tatara Womens' Work Song. 
There was an interview with meryl streep on Oprah. Meryl was supposed to be in the studio with Oprah,  but was so messed up on whatever she was taking that day that she had to do it via Skype.  It was the most embarrassing moment I've ever seen on television because it was live.  I mean Oprah tried so hard to lob softball questions to her,  the answers were so far of anything anyone could consider coherent that it was just unbelievable.  I mean the audience shots showed the confusion and awe as these people were truly witnessing a train wreck.  Her publicist must be god, because it cannot be found anywhere. 
- meryl streep shitcanned wasted interview I saw on you tube from the Oprah show. 
I completely agree! The way they're pricing hangars right now is nonsensical. Right now there's no real reason to pay to upgrade a hangar, when the upgrade comes *for free* with most ships. 
In a perfect world, your choice of hangar style for your "home base" hangar should be free. They should then charge piecemeal for additional hangar features like storage rooms, sleeping quarters, a board room for meetings, rec room, etc. Hell, charge us $0 per month for the "no frills"version of the Discount, Business, or Deluxe Hangar, with a dollar or two a month for each additional feature. Good way of generating some recurring revenue... 
**** stop charging for hangar upgrades that most people neither want or need. Make all three hangar styles scalable to fit any size ship, and then charge us for "bonus" rooms and features for our hangar.
Here are my times so far.  
  .  
Level 1-50 ... 3 days of 5 hours played.  15 hours total.
  .  
Limit break 1 ... 2 hours.  (solo)  
  .  
Level 51 - 55 ...  5 hours played.
  .  
Limit break 2 ... 1 hour.  (solo)  
  .  
Level 56 - 60 ... 8 hours played.  
  .  
Mission to rank 5 ... 5 hours played. (solo)  
  .  
Limit break 3  ... 4 hours played. (solo)  
  .  
Get 1 exp ... Limit break 4 ... 10 minutes.  
  .  
Level 61 - 70 ... 20 hours played.  (solo, can be done much faster grouped).  
  .  
Limit break 5 ... 2 hours ... failed as Samurai.  
  .  
Burned WHM to level 70 in Abyssea ... about 12 hours.  
  .  
Limit break 5 ... 10 minutes ... testimony on first Alchemist, 5 minute fight.  
  .  
It took me exactly 3 days to hit 75 cap.  
  
It had always been my plan to play MNK and PUP from the start, but I knew I wouldn't be beating Maat with either job, so I tried with SAM first and failed, so I just burned WHM up, and EASILY beat the fight.  
  
I then burned MNK up to my cap of 80, which took about another 12 or so hours, and then using the Aurore set capped my skills doing pages in Gustav tunnel.  Capping my skills took a surprisingly long time in comparisson. At least 6 hours.
  
Then I was finally able to go back into Aby and fight the worms myself. My cap was now 90, and with another lengthy worm party I was capped on exp and merits.  
  
It will be an easy hop-and-skip to 95. Breaking from 95 to 99 is a bit trickier simply because they are allowing the use of Trust NPCs in a future patch which will make this an EASY fight. Until then though, I will probably need to get a helping hand which might slow me down.  
  .  
... It only takes a little over 3 days of playtime SOLO to 75-cap if you pick a job you are 100% certain you can beat Maat with.  
  
You can hit 99 in under 5 days playtime and have full iLVL 117 gear if you don't mind selling your soul a bit in Abyssea.  
  
I consider both of these absolutely trivial in terms of investment of time vs. reward.  
  
Now is a great time to start fresh.

&gt; More love interest/companion interactions.
THIS is what I want the most.  DA:O did it pretty well, but because of the way it was animated and such, with no movements really or even that much facial expression (and no voiced Warden), the conversations felt static and got a little boring at times after 5+ playthroughs.  In DAII it seemed like every interaction with your LI (and really most regular companions, minus the sex part) was "hey here's my backstory", "oh hey, here's some horrible shit that's happened to me/my family/my cat/my people/my left shoe", "hey I need your help!", "oh hey, I love you let's have sex", and then "oh hey, final battle, we're all gonna die let's kiss."
That's oversimplifying, of course, and I really did love my lovers in DA2, but... I just want more wholesome interaction!  I don't care about the sex so much, that's not the core of a relationship in my mind (though it's certainly hot to see Fenris slam M!Hawke into the wall and passionately make out... I would never complain of more of that, hehe).
What I want is more interaction like in Mass Effect, particularly ME3, most especially in the Citadel DLC.  I want the silly jokes and the "laugh it up, Garrus," and the "what is she doing with her arms?" teasing, and the special date night dancing at the club, or a peaceful lunch at a cafe, or overlooking a beautiful view and hearing stories about a character's mother, or bragging about the Reaper you just killed over a game of poker.
I want that conversation, I want to see that depth of character that goes beyond "I'm a mage and I'm possessed and I want to free my people from the oppression of the Chantry and I'll hurt you even though I love you."  Hell, just tell me their favorite color!  ANYTHING.
I want more stories about Anders' life in the Circle, his friends and enemies, drama and midnight trysts, see him interacting with some kitties!  I want to hear more about Fenris' time with the Fog Warriors, what they were like, and what are some things he's always wanted to do that he and Hawke could do together.  I want wild stories from Isabela, about her voyages and adventures, to be shown the basics of how to sail a ship, to expose a little more of that sensitive, tender side she pretends she doesn't have.  I want Hawke and Carver (or Bethany) to reminisce more about their childhood, and swap stories.  I want more stories from Sebastian's wild younger years ;)  I want to know *anything* about Varric!  About his childhood, his life, BIANCA, anything!  I feel so close to him and yet, know next to nothing about him.
Aveline was one that I felt was perfectly executed.  She had lots of interaction that wasn't based on something she needed from Hawke, she gave up enough information about her past that you got to know her without it being too dull, she offers condolences on Hawke's mom's death (why didn't they all do this??  Why wasn't there a funeral, like the one for a certain character in ME Citadel?  I would have loved that - and cried).  I don't know, something about her I've always just found as well done.  I see her as a well-polished character who you get lots of good interaction with.
/rambling
 More character interaction, please!!!!
There is an area near where I live in the UK called Pendle, and was a hotspot for witch trials in the 17th century. I don't know a lot of the specific details but here's the link for anyone interested 
Anyway, this is area is very well known for paranormal and supernatural activity, so me and a group of friends decided to head up the one night in the summer a couple of years back. At this point I should say that I'm a sceptic about the whole paranormal thing, 2 or 3 of my friends who went really do believe in it all, whereas the majority think it's all rubbish. 
We went in the summer because it's at the top of a hill where we stopped and thought it's better to go on a nice day when the night will be warm. So we head up there and arrive at about 10:30pm, get out the cars and all of a sudden, the weather changes and a horribly cold wind blows past, not a constant thing, just one long chilly gale. So me and the other smokers make our own little group and have a cig and that's when we hear a child's laughter from near the cars. Both groups turned around, but saw nothing so went back to normal but with a side order of slightly creeped out. Then one by one, the car alarms started to go off one by one. We're properly freaked out at that one, as there was nothing to cause them to go off, and one of them didn't even have the alarm set. 
We go and stand in one group closer to the cars and here the laugh again but this time it's heading up the hill, all of us are a bit more on edge now. Then there's a chilling scream. Like a woman who's being slowly tortured, I'd never heard anything like it outside of a film and never wish to hear it again. But there was nobody else around us. Anybody who has been there knows how still and quiet it can be there. Immediately we are back into the cars and about to head home, and none of the engines would start. Car trouble can be expected from one, two at a push, but not from 5 cars at the same time. Proper panic started to set in as we heard the scream again but this time closer, sounded like just up the road from us. Cue 5 cars rolling down the hill with drivers trying to bump start them into life. 
We get away from the hill and everything seems to fine and back to normal, but we didn't want to stop and check until we were home. 
Never been back since. 
went to a haunted hill, heard creepy laughing, blood curdling screams, experienced 5 faulty cars and one terrified group of friends 
One simple thing. **Don't make it too complicated**
I am reading here, stop resolution posts, stop fanboy posts, stop unverified testimonials, no neogaf links... It goes on and on.
I just want to tell people to stop bitching. Putting those issues entirely on moderation is disingenuous. We as a community need to use up and downvotes to the best of our ability. Don't bite on troll posts, downvote and good god don't reply in comment. When you see another user falling vicitm, private message them to ignore such nonsense.

As mods you should only keep an eye out for flare ups. **Temporary** catch all threads for issues such as resolution comparison, update issues, major news announcements, and other issues that clutter the front page are a great and easily enforceable technique.
ish Don't cave into these whiny personalities who feel every annoyance must be policed. Every new rule filters out annoying content, but also good content (a meme made number one last week). It also burdens the moderators taking time away from other areas of sub development.
I feel like the majority of the X1 vs PS4 threads end up becoming toxic because they are simply a magnet for argument. Debate is a good thing, argument is not. 
I think we all know at this point that the X1 is slightly underpowered. It is hard to ignore. I personally don't need to see 10 threads a day about it. It is quite honestly a bit upsetting. 
I personally love my X1 and think that the horsepower issue is blown far out of proportion. In the coming years we are going to see tons of awesome stuff coming to the brand. I think Titanfall is the first step in a good direction. If Microsoft continues to seek cutting edge developers and bring new franchises to the brand we are going to see an awesome game library. 
The more we argue and make a huge issue about a small difference in specs, the more people are going to jump ship or talk down on the system. This talk is already starting to stir up a bad name for the brand. Sales are going to decline. Developers are going to have less interest in developing for Xbox. Its a toxic cycle and does nothing but hurt the entire brand and community.
Xbox has always been a better family to belong to, and I still think so. I mean, Major Nelson visits our subreddit and makes our complaints and wishes known to the people that can make stuff happen. Thats pretty amazing! We have already had a great community inspired update to the OS adding several requested features and theres more on the way. 
 
Lets spend more time talking about the future and where we want this console to go, instead of arguing about specs which are unfortunately set in stone at this point.
Where do we go from here: if you don't care about resolution stay out of the resolution threads. Like it or not a large portion of people interested in the console are interested in the console's power.
Don't automatically dismiss everyone who wants a Kinectless console as a troll. Like it or not a large portion of us have no interest in the Kinect but still like the Microsoft exclusives, just like we did on the Kinectless 360.
Finally everyone needs to understand that people may be critical of the console for a little while longer. It's the more expensive less powerful console. It will be a little before it builds up a library of really good exclusives to fully justify buying the console for a lot of people. Look at how much hate the Wii U got before it built up its library! Noe for the most part everyone either loves the console or just doesn't care about it. No one insults it for not having games or being too weak anymore! 
**tl; dr** Give the console time to mature and don't take critiques of the console personally. We're all here because we're interested in the X-box One, so let's not fight amongst ourselves. 
Just because some people in the community decided to appropriate the word for their use in a context-understandable manner doesn't mean they're actually doing something useful with it (not in terms of advancing any argument at least).
When someone brings up "synergy" and "holistic approaches" in a discussion I will be very inclined to knee them in the groin and exit conversation because, even though I can clearly understand the meaning behind those phrases they rarely ever add anything worthwhile to the discussion.
Metagame is becoming PS2's pet word for "something cool that isn't what I'm bored with already" and, if followed by actual content, it usually is an explanation of what the poster is actually talking about (WDS points? resource revamp? continent locking?), going on to show just how much of a buzzword it is and how it might as well not be there.
Incidentally, if those same people that toss around their "metagame = more objectives" definition cared for the "outside-of-game information" meaning, discussions would move along smoothly, instead of being derailed every time by their armchair game developer boner craving to use the cool words with no regard for the context set in the particular exchange.
**** if your explanation of any game feature involves the word 'metagame', you very likely can nuke out all the paragraphs that involve it without losing any meaning in the process.
Like a short story, a short film likely raises more questions than it answers. So any "explanation" that anyone gives (including me) is just their interpretation. And this is just off the top of my head...  
Opening scene: his life/interests/activities are of less interest to his parents than his heterosexual sister. Less interest implies less worth implies worthless.  
Finding comfort in the arms of strangers is hardly a new thing, so I assume that makes sense to anyone reading this now. Choosing to get fucked without a condom is, to the protagonist, a way of escaping the realities of his everyday life. 
Does he suffer from "Prufrockian Paralysis"? Well, no. He does approach/respond to men that are attracted to him. Is the act of destroying something a creative act? In general, yes. But this concept doesn't usually apply to destroying your own future. Is he actively searching out HIV+ people to fuck him? No, although the "condoms are rude" mantra is something I've only seen in the poz-and-proud crowd.  
TLDR some people internalize the messages from their family and society, that their lives are not as important as others, and then act in ways that are risky 
weed is available to all tourists over 18 years old in amsterdam. whether it is weed, pot or cakes in a coffee shop, or cakes in smart shops.
there was  legislation last year to only make weed available to residents but that only lasted 5 months before the idea was shot down because it would wreck the entire business of the country/city.
go get high in a coffee shop and relax
Running this deck since last rotation, so I hope I can help.
Idk how good Fated Conflagration is, but I think it´s just another Flesh in most cases. UWx Control will counter it anyways, so I doubt the value of it. Also, I would not side out Courser against Control as he smooths out your draws, it´s not even funny. Sure, they know what you draw, but things like Courser, Domri and Chandra make Control player cringe and wonder why a non-blue deck has so much card advantage.
Against Mono U, I´d keep the Dragon and Xenagos planeswalker and not side in Unravel. The plan is to keep the devotion-count low so that Thassa is never online. This should be manageable with 7 removal and 4 Domri.
Mono B, I regularly side out Polukrani as he comes down late and is easy removed. I don´t want to invest 4 mana when they remove it with 2 or 3 mana, just feels bad. Additional Chandras are nice in this match-up.
The mirror is something I had to struggle with, but I came to the conclusion that the maximum amount of Mizzium Mortars is right, because you can overload it quite easily(and it kills Dragons). A suggestion for your sideboard would be Nessian Wild Ravager. A friend told me the first thing he thought about the Hydra was "GR sideboard card for the Mirror" and he´s fucking right. They either let you remove a creature or you have a 12/12 that can possibly be bloodrushed for the win.
I haven´t played that much against RW Devotion, but you seem to have that right. 
Your plan vs. White Weenies without blue seems good. Vs WW with blue, I´d probably board out some numbers of Scooze and/or Rampager as you have not the tempo or the agression to make both work in that match-up.
 Switch Fated Conflagration for Nessian Wild Ravager and you´re good. You already have enough Sideboard cards for Control, so don´t worry. Overall pretty solid, have fun with our favorite Planeswalker-Hulk smash deck! =)

It´s the instant speed and one mana less that makes it so much better. Also, Witchstalker may be nice, but for a deck like this, he´s just "overcosted". His ability doesn´t matter vs. Burn (your guys are mostly out of burn-rage anyways), it doesn´t matter vs Control (they´ll play around the drawback and either cast Supreme Verdict or Edict you with Far/Away or whatever) and it doesn´t matter vs Mono Black because you have to suspect that they are still packing Devour Flesh somewhere in their 75. And if they can´t cast spells profitabely on your turn, they just pitch the cards to Pack Rat, so that´s that.
 Witchstalker´s good, but too impact-less for this deck.
Mine is when I was a freshman in highschool, my girlfriend was sleeping over but my mom wouldn't let her sleep in the same room as me so she decided to sleep on the couch. So next thing I know, I'm sneaking out of my room to go lay down with her downstairs (we had a decently sized couch). I see what I think is her laying there, face into the back of the couch, and I lay down next to and get... Snuggled in. I wake up later and long story short... My sister had came downstairs to let my girlfriend sleep in her bed meaning, I was cuddling with my sister. 
my girlfriend slept over and I ended up spooning my sister thinking she was my girlfriend. 
Agreed, all the 'Hart or Cohle are the Yellow King" theories assume that the biggest, most counter-intuitive, unpredictable revelation automatically makes the best story.  It doesn't.
The best evidence thus far for the Yellow King, a singular person who runs an underground, quasi-literary/spiritual cult that engages in the rape, torture and murder of young women, is a tall man with extensive facial scarring.  Someone who hasn't yet been on camera.
When you think about the logistics needed for Hart to do even a fraction of what would be required to orchestrate all of the cults actions (while spending virtually all of his time on the other side with Cohle) it just simply, falls the fuck apart
If Hart truly was the Yellow King, what would his first logical step be?  That's right, murder Cohle's ass dead.  Early and quietly.  Drop his ass off the grid somewhere it wouldn't ever pop back up.  No one at the department would miss him.
While it might be cool to speculate about, it's not what's going to happen in this series.
** Hart isn't sufficiently competent to do something as simple as conduct a single affair with a courthouse stenographer without detection.  He sure as hairy donkey ass can't successfully manage a clandestine, multi-layered murder-cult over the course of decades.**
Regarding group bonuses, does anyone know exactly how it calculates how much of a bonus you get? The past few weeks I have been getting 251 PIE from having a scholar in the group, and last night with the same scholar I was only getting 250, and I have no idea why. Normally it wouldn't bother me, but that 1 missing PIE meant that I was a single mana short of casting spells sometimes, and it happened a LOT throughout the night. Very annoying.
 why I missing PIE? :(
Hey, welcome!
Couple of things:
* You don't want to get a shitty bike to "learn on". It will make the learning process more difficult and more discouraging.
* Any bike that you can find for $150 is very likely to be shitty, the wrong size, or both. Save up twice the money and you might be in the game to get something decent from Craigslist. There's no shame in buying used, either - as long as the parts are good. People post CL finds in here ALL THE DAMNED TIME - so if you find something that looks promising, post it up and we'll let you know if it's a steal or if you're gonna get screwed over.
* You need a bike that fits your body, or you're going to be getting hurt a lot.
* At your size, getting a frame that isn't full chromoloy isn't an option - you're just going to break it and get hurt. Partial chromoly / partial hi-tensile steel, or full tensile steel is going to fuck you over. Make sure you get chromoly forks and bars as well!
A bike your size will probably have the following geometry:
* Top tube (the main tube between the seatpost and the head tube, where the forks go through) should be 21.5" - 21.75". Some dudes on here claim to be 6'6" and perfectly comfortable on a 20.5" top tube. They're either full of shit, shitty at riding and don't know it, or some sort of freak of nature. At 6'2", a 21.25" feels a little short at times - so you definitely want to make sure the top tube is long enough.
* Huge fucking bars. I'm talking, S&amp;M Perfect 10s are probably your best bet - 10" rise, 30" wide. I personally run Odyssey Sandbars - 9" rise, 29" wide - but I'm a bit shorter than you are. Some people will go on about how big bars are for trendfuckers. Ignore these people. If you're tall, you need your bike to put you in a spot where you're standing up straight so that you can actually control it. You don't wanna be fucking craning your neck back and holding your shoulders weird so you can fucking see. That's how you get hurt.
* 180mm cranks - as in, each crank arm should be 180mm long. 170mm and 175mm are pretty common, but trust me - you'll feel way less cramped up on 180mm cranks.
Unfortunately there aren't a lot of (if any) completes that you can buy new for cheap that will have parts that fit you, simply because most riders aren't so tall. As a dude that falls on the taller end of the spectrum (6'2"), I have spent a lot of time researching parts and speaking with riders that are taller than I am, so I feel qualified to speak on this
_"What the hell, John, you're obsessing about inches and millimeters here!"_ is what you're probably thinking at this point. Honestly, the thing about BMX is that a couple of millimeters here and an inch there can be the difference between your bike feeling dialed, and your bike being un-fucking-rideable.
Ride a couple of different bikes - your buddies, random bros at the skatepark, whatever - before you buy anything. Ride bikes that are definitely too fucking small so you know what a small bike feels like, and ride bikes your size so you know what to look for when you find that sick dream bike / Craigslist score / whatever.
**** Sorry for the fucking wall of text, but if you're really a total noob, that's pretty much everything you need to know to get started. Read it. Good luck.
People who say things like that obviously know very little about the bible. The lesson to be learnt from that story is not that A&amp;E fucked it up, but that mankind is fundamentally sinful.
Anyone would have bitten the fruit of the TOTKOGAE, not just Adam and Eve.
as a side note, most biblical scholars believe that A&amp;E was a metaphor for the early humans rejecting god.

tldr - SRS don't like loli
I guess you could say he does have the right to antagonize people, but in this scholars opinion, that is the biggest waste of freedom of speech imaginable. He could convey the same message, minus wearing his ass on his head. He could be informative, try to teach people, but instead he his telling people "shame on you" because they need to get to their exams in a few minutes? Why is he so vehemently shoving the Bill of Rights down everyone's throats? There are other things that are more important like the UN Declaration of Human Rights. The Bill of Rights is probably one of the only things, aside from a few select Bible verses, that this buffoon has retained.
 Freedom of speech and freedom to be an asshole are not the same.
This sentence made me just cringe so much.
The is pretty cringy too.
My first two "relationships" were in high school and neither one lasted more than like a month. We never even kissed. So I guess my real first relationship is my current one. We've been together a little over two years now, which isn't a very long time in comparison to others, but I'm still pretty proud of myself. I feel really happy that I managed to find such a great guy so early in my life (I was 19 when we started dating). He's not perfect and we both have some "issues" but we work through them. And with our relationship going long distance roughly eight months ago I feel like we're so much closer than we ever were before. He also calls me his "best girlfriend ever", so that's good too. Hehe.
 I think I've done pretty well so far.
I'm just happy the mom didn't hit Lindsay. I always got hit by my parents and still have lots of visible injuries on my back. I started withdrawing from everyone and was scared of people. I never had any friends and still don't.
 Parents should discipline their kids in ways that happened in the story.
I had a discussion about this with a poster here over a month ago. My point is exactly the point you made. I just don't find it sustainable.
Why Chelsea? What parent/agent would want their kid to go to Chelsea knowing that more than likely, they would be loaned out and then sold. At worse, they are loaned out to different clubs year after year. 
I'm sure Chelsea can continue in some form, but, I doubt they can lure the likes of Courtios, Lukaku, KDB, &amp; Piazon in the future when they start to see that signing for Chelsea probably means you'll be playing somewhere else.
 If I had a talented kid, I wouldn't want him signing for Chelsea. 
I really like it. It's sensible, sustainable, and can only help the club in the long run. 
It's sensible in that the players benefit from getting time on the pitch, and we then benefit as a club because they come back, in theory, as better players. 
The sustainability thing is pretty obvious I guess, but if you buy young players, try them out, make them better players, and sell the ones who don't work out, then you are likely making a profit or at least coming close to breaking even. In the days of FFP this is becoming more and more important. 
I also think it helps the club's image because we're showing ambition to move beyond being a "splash the cash on established talent" club and becoming one that promotes from within and supplements from the outside in other positions. Even Barcelona doesn't field a 100% homegrown squad (though they could), so I don't think that should be our goal, but the idea of having young players that we've brought up through our own system is really appealing to me. 
 I think our youth system is becoming one of the best things about our club and will ensure our place as a force to be reckoned with for years to come. 
My gym has some of the most dedicated people I know. (Seriously, Vertical Ventures in Tampa, if you're reading this you guys Rock) and they don't get any kind of tips.
One of the girls who works there spent 5 hours helping me find the perfect fit for a brand new shoe. They have no tip jar, but instead look to make real connections with people who come in to better themselves and get into the sport. 
I can say that the "tip" you are receiving should be being able to do something fun for minimum wage. It sure as hell beats working the fry machine at fast food joints. 
I would never say you don't deserve one ( I mean, I don't know you, but I am assuming you do a decent job) but I don't feel it should be expected. Expecting a tip defeats the whole purpose and kind of devalues it. A tip should be an above and beyond kind of gratitude given to someone who gives a truly  memorable experience. If you can't say at the end of the day that you left a lasting impression on someone, then you should not expect a tip from them.  Everyone wants to make more money, so I don't blame you though, just try and get some satisfaction from having a truly awesome job.
 Its great to get tips, but you shouldn't have a jar expecting people to tip. Instead just do the best damn job you can do, and if someone tips awesome!
The trouble with the more cynical world view that she is "graduating to" (ie, I'm better at fund raising than swinging a hammer) is that it would lead to even less cultural intercourse.  Would she have come to the decision to help fund and direct the camp if she had not gone down and built a terrible wall, seen the state of things, failed first hand, decided on her own where her strengths and weaknesses lay?  Probably not.
  Yet it seems like would almost proposing future "white kids" like her just stay home in their little bubbles of privilege and maybe do a little fund raising on the side.  American's are so isolated, rarely travel, and have such a poor sense of how the rest of the world works and what it's like to try to interact with someone from a very different background than oneself.  Having kids volunteer at least begins to open their eyes and clue them in, if they are open to these types of insights.  And for every one like her who decides her strengths lie in embracing their upper middle class background, there may be another who decides to really get good at Spanish, or at construction, and go back the next year.
it's like physics classes freshman year of college.  It's not That the work done has great merit, so much as you are exposing people to something new as well as preparing those who decide they want to go on in the field.
According to that graph, an obese person will cost the insurance company about 6.8 times as much as I will, however they will only be paying 6 times as much. 
Even those numbers are a little too generous, since the graph doesn't include smoking while I assume they do smoke. If you assume they don't smoke to make it apples to apples (the smoking discount is $25), they pay only 4.75 times as much as me.
And even then it's still generous, because there are other ways available for them to get discounts while still being obese.
They get 7 times more product for only 5 times the cost.
A lot of people already said it but basically, the execution of their amazing premise was pretty poor, it fell short and it didn't live up to the hype they put into it. Other than that, I hated Rex and his storyline as well, and I hated how the whole thing seemed to focus a little too much in him, as if we'd care about a guy we just met and have barely emotional connection with. Honestly, I liked better all the other "new" characters that got killed off more than Rex. I didn't particularly hate that it was set in America, but sadly thanks to that it did feel a little *too* American. Or maybe that's not the right way to say it but I fail to find a better sentence, so we'll go with that for now. What I'm trying to say is... I don't know, it just felt really disconnected from everything we knew. Disconnected from Doctor Who's universe, yes, but also disconnected within Torchwood's universe as well. Maybe being set in America helped to make that worse, maybe it would've felt that way no matter what, but that's just how I felt watching it. Also, according to Miracle Day there's some crazy maybe alien maybe not maybe whatever else it is giant ass crack in my country. Which is bizarre and hilarious but they intended it to look threatening and scary so yeah, it basically didn't work out for me.
 Unlikeable/uninteresting new "main" character that stayed opposed to the much more interesting other new characters that left or weren't explored better, very poor and boring execution of an amazing premise, it felt disconnected from everything else they've already set as a base of their own show.
There's a book called This Is How by Augusten Burroughs. Great writer, but most of the book is bullshit.
HOWEVER, he has a chapter on suicide that I found incredibly helpful.
Basically, if you're living, even if you are miserable, it is still possibly for you to feel some sort of positive emotion at some point in the future, even just temporarily. It could be as simple as the satisfaction of a cold glass of water after being outside in hot weather; anything that brings even fleeting happiness.
On the other hand, if you die, all you will ever feel for the rest of your existence is pain and fear (this is assuming you don't believe in an afterlife, obviously). Death doesn't bring "relief", it brings absolute nothingness. So it doesn't make you feel better; and no matter what method you choose to commit suicide, you will be in some sort of pain, and some part of your brain will probably panic. Meaning that after that point, all you will ever have felt in your life (however long it lasts) will be more of what you were trying to escape.
**Even if life is horrible, you will still get to experience some sort of positive thing at some point in the future. Dying brings nothingness, but that isn't the same as relief from suffering**
EDIT: Obviously I'm not saying thi applies in situations like a lifetime of extreme and ongoing torture. There actually are some things worse than dying. I'm addressing mostly emotional pain.
Ooh! I love comparing these games. I've sunk probably around 500 hours into League, and after picking up Dota I'm almost at 100. 
League definitely feels more like a fighting game. It's all about comboing on the other guy while maintaining spacing and keeping up dat CS. The gameplay is generally more varied, when you can pick up and play just about any position, jungle, mid, ADC, support, top, or whatever. It gives you goals to work for, also, which is one thing about it I really like.
The downside of this game is that, unlike Dota, you don't have all the playable characters unlocked. This is where the F2P aspect comes in. You can either grind a few games to get your next champion, or just drop a couple bucks on them. I know I did a bit of both. Also, the meta game is a bit stale, with the same five positions (mentioned above) no matter what. Also the rune system skews the game in favor of experienced players ever so slightly. 
With Dota, it's definitely a strategy game. High mana costs, long cool downs on hero abilities, and shitloads of damage from any source. You either play carefully or get dunked by anything and everything. That's the biggest downside of Dota, it's not noob friendly in the slightest. The teamfights are lightning fast, the landing phases are long, and the game can snowball out of control really really fast. 
But the things I like about This game, are that the snowball gets rolling, but it can go either way at any point in the game. You have one super fed character on the other team? One solid CC lock and it's game over for them. You start Getting the momentum rolling. Soon enough you are knocking on their door saying "Sup dog?" That and you don't have to unlock anything, which is super nice.
**TLDR** League for faster paced, grind centric gameplay, Dota for long thought out gameplay.
Be warned with respect to TNG - the first season is nearly unwatchable.  I was a friggin' *hardcore* trek fan long before TNG ever hit the airwaves and it was so disappointing I didn't watch again until season three.
Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by the turnaround in quality.  Season one isn't all bad, there are (maybe) half a dozen semi-watchable episodes but things get better in season two (The Measure Of A Man, for example)
- stick it out with TNG past season one, you'll be very well rewarded if you do.
I am not a doctor, but I have looked into this as a lay person.
You have to start by defining the term "addiction".  It is not a word that has an agreed upon definition, but there are hallmarks that point towards a person having an addiction.  Some of the common ones are:
* Obsession - Thinks about the activity constantly, usually over a prolonged period of time.  
*  Compulsion - does the activity even when they know they shouldn't, or can't stop when they know they should.  
*  Withdrawal - problems that occur when ceasing the activity.  
*  Denial and Hiding - Denies a problem, and hides evidence of the activity or minimizes the actual level of activity.  
*  Loss of Control - No control over the behavior
These will apply to any kind of addiction, be it to an activity, an object or a substance.  These are general guidelines, and there are more specific items that a professional will address.  It is worth noting that the DSM-5 only recognizes substance addiction *edit - and gambling addiction*, although it refers to other types of addiction unofficially.  
Addiction treatment is specifically for detrimental addictions.  This is an important distinction, because if you have addictive indicators, but there is no detriment, then there is no need to define it as an addiction.  Addiction to food or drugs is clearly detrimental and needs treatment to end the addiction, while addiction to video games or vinyl records may not need treatment or intervention.  Both are still addictions, based on how addiction is identified.
***  Many medical professionals agree that video games can be addictive because a significant number of people who play them exhibit addictive behaviors or hallmarks.  Whether that addiction is harmful is situational.
That Doc and a BBC one finished any faint hope i had for Afghanistan. It's another Vietnam. We need to leave.
[**The deeply depressing BBC report concerning the June 2010 audit published by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the $27B the US has spent, and apparently wasted, on training and supplies for the Afghan forces.** transcript can be read on link](
The auditor described the process as like funnel. A wide mouth being crammed with money at the US end and a narrow trickle of fuel, uniforms, guns and training at the Afghan Unit level. Value is siphoned off at every level.
She also asked to see the top rated Afghan police unit. This unit has had $M's spent on them and can stand on their own feet holding down a region of Afghanistan according to the unit ratings report. She was told that this area was out of US control and it was unsafe to go there without a major operation as the unit had possibly gone native. **That was rated the best unit in US army reports.**
The relevant parts of the doc:
BBC: *The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reports to the
Congress, the Pentagon and the Secretary of State. One of the main failings highlighted in
the most recent audit is that some of the Afghan army and police are extremely adept at
pilfering equipment and essential supplies and selling them on for cash.The report’s author, Emily Rachman, in her firstbroadcast interview about her findings, points to a culture of routine dishonesty.*  
RACHMAN: During our work we discovered that the supplies were
not reaching their intended recipients. Sometimes partial shipments made it to the unit level,
but often units were just not receiving what they needed. So an enormous amount of
supplies being poured into what someone described as a large funnel and very little of it
actually getting out to the unit level, particularly where units are far flung in the outer
provinces, so the further you went the more likely it was that there was some loss of
supplies.   
BBC: *And what sort of supplies are going missing?*    
RACHMAN: Fuel is one of the most vulnerable supplies. We heard
about ammunition, food, uniforms, virtually anything that is being moved around was
potentially vulnerable for resale.    
BBC: *You concentrate particularly on fuel. Why was that?*    
RACHMAN: It was particularly interesting for us, because it is a
key supply for enabling operations, so it was of great concern to us if the supplies that the
coalition is providing are being stolen to a degree that it’s hampering operations and it had a
direct impact on the ratings of the units in the end.    
BBC: *Which raises the question of how well America’s
$27 billion have been spent on training Afghan forces, and how well their capability has
been measured. This summer, the US Special Inspector General reported that the system for
measuring the capability of Afghan forces was seriously flawed and overstated their ability
to operate on their own, without coalition supervision. The report’s author, Emily Rachman,
was alarmed by an example of misplaced confidence.*
RACHMAN: We became quite interested in a police district called
Baghlan-e Jadid, which is located in the north of the country. We were told that this police
district had received a top rating and in fact had fully graduated from the police development
programme, meaning that it had achieved a level of competence where it had earned the
ability to just operate independently. Of course that’s our goal for all the Afghan security
forces and this piqued our interest. We requested to go out and visit this unit. What we
learned as we put in that request was that it was too dangerous to travel to this area and that
the capabilities of the police had most likely deteriorated so badly that there was really no
law and order being provided by the Afghan forces in that area.
BBC: *You were told that this police district had actually
been overrun by insurgents?*
RACHMAN: We were, yes. 
BBC: *And this was a top rated police district?*   
RACHMAN: This was a unit that continued to be rated at the top
level capability throughout the time of our review, and one of our recommendations was that
where no monitoring has been conducted, that we not kid ourselves and report a much higher
level of capability than we actually knew to be there.
**** We are wasting our money and lives in Afghanistan.  
Its sad that the BBC got an interview long with her and not a US media outlet. It was very revealing.
They said themselves they're running this much differently than Qusayr, they learned from their past mistakes. Firstly they're encircling yabrud completely to not give the rebels a last minute escape route. They could have immediately made a ground assault through rima farms but they would have sustained heavy casualties. There is no need for them to rush things and unnecessarily lose manpower considering they have captured all the high points overlooking Yabrud and can just relentlessly bombard and siege it. I did see some tweets about SAA being at the front gate of Yabrud so it seems the ground assault is coming.
Remember if you count all the skirmishing in the countryside leading up to the ground assault the Qusayr offensive took over 2 months to capture the city and Yabrud definitely has more fighters and have had time to prepare defenses. That being said they already have the city more or less surrounded and I'd expect the real ground assault to begin within the next few days and the city to fall not long after that.
: They're trying to surround the city and reduce casualties from a high-risk and premature ground assault
Apparently tact is not a requirement for an assistant AD position.
Looks like Manziel took that screenshot
While I am not going on camera, I will say that one thing that people might overlook is that female gamers who have children are even more disregarded then when you do not have kids.  This is one story, but if you want more, I can surely give you a few of them.  I also have a few good ones in regards to gaming and kids, too.
I took my 3 small children into a gamestop a while back to buy some Steam Giftcards(that is the way I keep track of my steam spending so I do not spend too much).  My kids are 2, 4, and 6 and I am still relatively young looking, I guess.  I was in a bit of a hurry and just wanted to get in and out really quickly, so I just walked up to an employee and asked where they had Steam Giftcards, assuming that would be faster then searching the store myself.  The employee judged me right off the bat and decided I must be buying something for my husband and have no idea what I was looking at.  They explained the difference between PS4 and XBone to me.  Then they asked me which one does my husband play?  Or, if I do not know, do I remember any titles that he plays like Call of Duty or Battlefield?  I stopped them several times during this speech to ask about Steam Giftcards and said I wanted to buy games on Steam for myself, but they trudged onward.  When it got down to them showing me controllers and asking if any of them looked familiar to what my husband normally plays with, I decided I had had enough and bought my giftcards at best buy instead.
TL:DR&gt; When you have kids, everyone assumes you are an idiot.
It may have something to do with which lymph nodes are involved.
It also may have something to do with the fact that (cortico)steroids are used for some treatments and testosterone is a steroid-hormone.
My medical knowledge is not extensive, but I did find this:

EDIT:  There may actually be a medical reason for this specifically.
Everybody's diabetes is different.  We'll all have different blood glucose ranges. We'll all have different carb ratios to gauge how much insulin to administer when eating food. We'll all have different types/amounts of bolus and long acting insulin.  However, that basic concept of treating diabetes stays the same.  Unless your doctor puts you onto a special diet for whatever reason he may have...monitoring your glucose levels and keeping them in a pseudo-normal range is our ultimate goal here.  It keeps your body healthy and helps to minimize all long term side effects of diabetes.  Restricting sugary foods is what most people know about diabetes, and yes that is correct, that is a major aspect of handling your diet for a couple reasons: 1. Those sugary/processed foods offer little-to-no nutritional value anyway, so its just a waste. 2.  Those foods are high in sugar content which make it more difficult to accurately reign in your blood sugars as your body fights to maintain homeostasis. 3.  Most those sugary food will have a very high glycemic index which means if your blood sugars haven't raised immediately from the immense sugar content...once the simple carbohydrates start breaking down into your stomach, you will have major blood sugar spikes which are also hard to control.  It's also easier for your blood sugar to come crashing down and put you into the hypoglycemic range as its coming down from a high spike. That being said, if you maintain a regular diet of healthy foods that people without diabetes tend to strive for such as: complex carbs that have a low glycemic index, vegetables, lean protein, dairy, fruits, grains, etc etc; have worked with your doctor to establish a proper treatment regimen; and take your prescribed medication correctly, then gaining with diabetes doesn't have to be too difficult.  Granted, there are a lot of factors that go into it and are worth talking to your doctor about such as if you want to take creatine, or pre-workout, or any of those things but then we'd be here all day teaching you about diabetes as if you had just been diagnosed.  If carbohydrate intake per meal is measured, and you are medicated with the correct amount of insulin per injection before that meal, then gaining with diabetes is totally doable! No need to feel discouraged! GAIN ON!
   # of carbs in + correct calculated # of cc's of insulin taken = happy blood sugars &amp; GAINZ
My opinion is that coyotes are borderline op atm. This is due to a few reasons but the main contributing factors are the fire rate and reload speed. It takes roughly a second to fire one mag and 2 seconds to reload if they are certed. What this means is that there is no punishment for missing coyote shots. 
I also feel the lockon range should be toned down a slight bit to promote them as a close range weapon as they were intended to be. 
Lastly I don't really like what they do the growth of a pilot's skill level. 
- coyotes are too forgiving. 
I actually regret not adding a guy from an lfr run. We were sticking through an average of 3 determination stacks a boss in the last tier of SoO. My toons name is olympus and this sly dog made the joke "Olympus has fallen!" When i died. Whole raid laughed their asses off. 
 my name is olympus and some guy said "olympus has fallen" when i died. 
So a while ago I started volunteering at a children's hospital with my then girlfriend, just because I had some extra time. She and I were some of the only volunteers that was over 18 (all the others were doing it for college apps). You had to be at least 18 to go up to the NICU and PICU units. So one day, I get called out of the playroom where I usually spend my time to go to a patient room, and I get there and they just say "Here, hold this baby. Don't pinch any of the tubes."
I'd never held a baby in my life, I realized at that point. So imagine that the baby is a total stranger's, has like eighteen-bazillion lines and tubes running out of it, and some kind of device implanted in its stomach that was big enough that I could see it's outline.
 Never held a baby for nineteen years, first one is a cyborg monster.
Treating my own wounds.
My dog's really strong, but she's a puppy and a bit anxious, so she'll sometimes grab a toy away before I can act. Which leads to some pretty iffy bites. Which also leads to this macho sense that I can take care of myself, except that I haven't done first aid classes in a dog's age and don't know the first signs of when a treatment is enough or too much.
 I baby my wounds too much and should just go learn how to do shit properly from a first aid class.
Oh god hwy 980 in Oakland, CA is REALLY poorly maintained so there's ruts/potholes EVERYWHERE as well as a 45 mph speed limit due to how shitty the road is. I pretty much never drive on it but I was taking my boss to the airport at like 8pm and I was in the right hand lane doing the speed limit where there was no shoulder and not even enough room for that little line, and this BIG ASS RIG goes by me just slightly faster and damn near pushed me into the barrier. My boss was laughing at me for freaking out about it but I thought we were gonna hit the barrier, spin around, and get squished by the back wheels of the truck.
**** Fuck driving near barriers and fuck speeding big-rigs.
Immigration never bothered me, but customs always makes me a bit edgy. When I was studying abroad in college I flew home for the weekend because my sister was really sick. Because it was just the weekend, I flew carry-on. NEVER FLY CARRY-ON INTERNATIONALLY. Short international trips make you look like a drug mule. As soon as I handed over my customs forms it was straight to the secondary inspection line where they dig through all your shit. I had everything tightly rolled in my backpack so I could go carry on (this was pre-massive roll-aboards) and she went through *everything*. I was in tears just because in all my years of flying this had never happened to me and I was super nervous. Then she starts flipping through my passport and asks me about places I had visited: 
"So...who do you know in Malaysia?"
"Well, my parents country club is there."
"And why were you in Indonesia?"
"Vacation?"
At this point I was such a blubbery mess, I think she was finally just getting embarrassed for me. She pushed all my stuff down the table and told me I could repack it, I was clear. Yeah, thanks for that. 
I would not hold up well under interrogation tactics of any kind. 
Parent's intent:You are our friend, someone we have a great deal of trust in, so much so that we will gladly allow you the opportunity to hold the thing that means the most to us in our lives right now. This gesture of trust should show you how important you are to us and how much we trust you.
Received message: Here's something that you know you'd better not screw up because this small human life is worth more to us than our own lives and we are wanting to present this great burden upon you. Don't screw this up, seriously, this thing is more valuable than your life, and should you threaten it, we will end yours... friend.
Seriously, you'd let the guy who ran up a $300 tab at an Applebee's bar on Mardi Gras while on a business trip hold the most important thing in your life? You call yourself a friend for handing this little bundle of liability off to me and expect me to feel anything other than the paralyzing fear of damaging your little faberge egg. I understand you want it to be a symbol of trust, but if you wanted to show me a great symbol of trust, give me your secret pudding recipe, not a living, wriggling, liability for which I could be held responsible for its care during those scant few moments I agree, like an idiot, to hold while you stare at me judging. If I drop your kid, you call the police, if I share your recipe, someone else makes pudding. Both make me less trustworthy, but one ends up with more pudding. 
** Friends don't suggest that other friends hold their babies, instead they make pudding.**
Story time!
I was serving on the USS Cole in 2006, and on the return home we stopped in Civitavecchia, Italy.  It's about an hour and a half to Rome by train, so that's what we decided as a group to do.  It was me and 5 other guys wanting to see the Vatican.  Anyway, disaster almost struck before we got there.  I stopped at a vending machine to get a bottle of water and when I turned around the train starting leaving without me and one other person I was with.  Before I know it the rest of our group is waving at us to get our asses on the train (we are ordered to stay together at pretty much all costs) while my friend is holding the door open.  The seemingly easy task of stepping from the platform to the moving train sounds easy in theory, but when it starts speeding up and you see the tracks and mechanical monstrosity moving below you, you get pretty fucking scared.  All it would take is one slip and that train would have killed me.
Boarding a train makes me nervous now. 
The fruits and vegetables part.
So I was on a flight back from Quito into somewhere in Florida, and the day before I had packed two Bananas to eat before my first flight (my goodness, if you're ever in Ecuador, live off of the bananas. They are unlike anything I've ever had in the States. I truly love them. They're not only a phenomenal 'for scale' object, but to put that succulent sweetness into your mouth when you're on the equator is a story in and of itself) I digress. 
So I naturally forgot about them and came into the States. First question "do you have any fruits or vegetables" and I say no, because I truthfully didn't think I did. 
Second question "can we look inside your bag?" of course you can! I have nothing to hide!
Fuck shit god damnit. They found the bananas which led them to question me for about 30 minutes. Scariest 30 minutes I've ever had at an airport. I thought I would be thrown into g-bay for bringing the best of fruits into the country. May have squeaked a bit of urine out while being questioned. 
They did let me go, and let me eat my nanners too. 
**TLDR**: eat nanners if you go to Ecuador. 
When my dog was 8 weeks old my mother in law was sitting in a chair on a wood floor and went to pick up the puppy. I quickly warned that she is much stronger and braver than she looks and may try to jump so hold tight (she is a very strong corgi made of lead) and as my mother in law is saying "I've raised babies, I won't drop her" she drops her and in trying to catch her she just flipped her on her little head on the wood floor. I grabbed her and ran away to make sure she was ok. She is a genius, though, so in a way I guess if she is dumber for it we've saved humanity from an evil corgi overlord.  
Still angry at my MIL.   
 don't brush off warnings. 
And airport security in general.
First time I flew was when I was 13, from Pennsylvania to Cairns, Australia. When I got to the line where you put your carry-on through the scanner, they told me that I had water in my backpack and I needed to get rid of it.
So I leave the line, check for water, can't find it. Come back and ask them about it. Check again, find my metal water bottle that I forgot about. Don't know what to do with it, so I come back again, ask them where to dump it.
Take care of that, put my bag back through the scanner, there's still something liquid. Find a bottle of shampoo. Run bag through again. What is it this time? It's my netbook. FINALLY I get through okay, and am still in everyone's way trying to reassemble all my crap and put my shoes back on.
I suck at packing
Since I've posted all over this thread, I may as well make my own comment. I have a whole host of anxiety disorders, which makes almost everything into a festival of adrenaline. Some of the most notable include:
Calling people. I am almost incapable of using the phone, my heart races whenever I hear the dial tone. I don't even know why this one gets to me so much, but it's to the point that I avoid calling anyone ever unless it's an absolute must.
Ordering food. Between worrying about being judged, worrying about getting tongue-tied, worrying about the server feeling like I'm wasting their time... I try to have my entire order rehearsed in my head and spit it out as quickly and clearly as possible just to get the moment over with.
Messaging people online / texting. We've known each other for 10 years and talk nearly every day? I probably shouldn't message first, just in case you changed your mind and decided you hate me for no real reason.
Going to the doctor for an actual problem. I always feel like I'm going to disgust them - ESPECIALLY when they ask questions like when my last period was or if I have diarrhea. No, no, I um... I'm normal. I'm fine. I'll just go home now...
Talking to a other people's kids. I like kids; they're adorable and I connect with them better than people my age a lot of the time. But I'm terrified that someone is going to think I'm doing something shady just by talking to them. And related... 
Holding babies. Holy hell, please do not offer for me to hold your baby. I'm afraid you'll be offended if I say no, but I'm even more afraid I'm going to drop it, or hold it wrong and it stops breathing, or cause it to cry, or something awful. When I do hold them, I just sit there like it's caused me lethal paralysis.. just sitting... motionless... until they finally take it back. Even worse is when some gracious savior goes to take the baby and the parent tells them "Oh no no, EllieLove91 is our guest! Let her hold the baby!"
Showering at night / when home alone. I'm 22 years old, the door is locked, the screendoor is locked, and I have two dogs that like to bark if a leaf blows across the porch. Yet I'm absolutely certain that somehow, someone is going to break in at the exact moment I'm showering.
Driving next to semis. This is especially fun since the area I live in is specifically for truckers to go through. I'm always terrified they're going to jack-knife or swerve into me or fall over like a cow being tipped. 
Posting online (including Reddit). I'm sure that I'm going to have typos, or be downvoted to oblivion or something. It's very rare for me to do more than lurk on any site I go to. 
Accepting a drink or food from anyone. I don't want to inconvenience them with my stupid thirst / hunger, even if they have already gone out of their way just to offer it.
Talking about shows or movies with new people. I don't get into Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or things like that. I'm sure they're fine, but they don't do anything for me personally. Instead I watch cartoons... and murder shows (like the stuff on Investigation Discovery). No, I haven't seen the newest toddler torture on Honey Boo Boo, but did you see where that pregnant woman was killed and her baby stolen?! No? Oh, um... What about Finn's new grass sword on Adventure Time? Wasn't that co- Oh, you don't watch that 'kiddie show'? Oh... um... ok...
Typing in front of people. I have clocked in at 120WPM before, and I know I type faster than that when it's something I'm planning to type and not having to register it through reading beforehand. I live in a VERY computer illiterate area, where most people do that key-poking thing. So when they catch me typing relaxed or hear about me typing, they always want to watch or test me. And it makes me so nervous that I never score above 80 and I make enough typos to fill a small e-book. 
 Some of us are meant to be hermits. Don't interfere with the natural order! 
Semi-related: last night I was driving and I got a call from a number I didn't recognize but had my area code; I answer the call and just heard back ground noise. I said hello a few times and just as I was about to hang up this woman says, "who's this?" In a very rude and abrupt fashion. Taken aback I politely said, "my name is Josh, I just got a call from you and I think you may have the wrong number." The bitch didn't say anything but just hung up. Moral of the story is no one cares about answering the phone unless you're an asshole. 
 bitch called, bitch hung up, I taught you guys a lesson in the form of a short mostly pointless story. 
I'm a very friendly guy, but whenever I see someone especially another dude that I barely know its really fucking awkward and I get very nervous. Is it weird that I'm more comfortable around women than men?  I'm a straight male in my 20's and I have never had problems talking to girls AMA
Doing math. Even simple addition my mind goes blank and I stop trying. It goes back to a math teacher I had in third grade. Teachers are important and can screw you up if they don't care about their job.  
 pay teachers more
Taking out the trash..................
When I was in the third grade I was taking out the trash to the curb from my house and my yard has this small hill that you would have to walk slow from when going to the sidewalk . Well I had this bright idea that I could just throw the bag down the hill to the curb but because the bag was heavy I was leaning and then swung the bag once behind me then let go when it went forward. Totally nailed it! Ran back in the house but noticed I was breathing harder than usual, my yard is small,I felt dizzy and stumbled.when I got back up I noticed a "cat scratch" line of blood on my leg, no biggie but I felt sort of weird.when I opened the front door I felt pale and worn out.all my sisters looked at me and I all I could let out was a simple "I'm cut"and passed out. Turns out the garbage bag had broken glass that cut me when I threw the bag down the hill. I never felt it, guess since I was really excited that I made the toss. Well 15 stitches and years later I still don't take the trash out without sweating bullets. Or handling broken glass and ceramic for that matter.
 cut my leg open from broken glass in the trash bag while tossing it across the yard and didn't feel it. Now, much traumatic.
A friend of mine once told me how, in her sociology class, her professor told the class that people aren't actually afraid of heights. Rather, they are afraid of what they would let themselves do at that height. 
 I *feels* you friend.
I used to be SO nervous about reading aloud in class when I was in middle school. I would count ahead and see which paragraph I would have to read, practice it, and then inevitably fuck it up.
So I decided that the only way to get better would be to force myself to do so, and I started raising my hand all the time.
By senior year of high school, I LOVED reading aloud.
TL:DR: there's hope!
I think the same way, although I am young and haven't begun saving for retirement.  Not comfortable with the idea of fiat currency or having everything invested in stocks/bonds/etc, call me crazy, whatever.  
Not sure that investing in guns is viable where I am because of laws and such, but I have been considering the idea of investing what little I do have at the moment in tools/capital equiptment.  I figure that having these gives me immediate options (use, rent out, or liquidate them) which I value more than pennies in accrued interest.  
I will be in the market for a vehicle soon as well. A truck gives me more options over a car.  It would make it easier to transport the tools should I go that route. Even if I didn't , I could use it as leverage in other ways. Offer transportation service for cash or barter on the side to friends/family. Avoid future delivery fees, etc. You get the idea.
Was managing to save for some time working full time. But that was only because my expenses are small as a young single male, not that I make good money.  So I decided to drop hours to where I make a little over what I need to get by and instead invest that time into learning programming/web development stuff. Which I have dilengently stuck to.. Still a long road though.  Risky, but possible long term payoff.
 a more contrarian perspective to investing.

 

True story: in middle school I had to play a name game with my entire class (~40 ppl so not that big but still), where you come up with an action word that starts with the same letter as your first name, and an accompanying movement. I.E. if your name is Luke, you can be Leaping Luke and jump up and down.
I was near the end of the circle, and I couldn't think of a single action word that started with J (my name is John). Finally it was almost my turn, and in a panic I asked my friend for help. "How about Jackoff John?" he says. At the time I thought 'jacking off' just meant dicking around or something, so I'm like, "Sure!"
My turn comes up, and in front of the whole room I declare myself Jackoff John -- with accompanying hand motion, mind you. Didn't take long for one of the teachers to suggest I change it to 'Jousting John'...

Called myself "Jackoff John" during a name game in middle school. Score.
It never got as bad as the porn thing for me, but there were about 2-3 years in my mid 20's where I was so freaked out about just the thought of performance anxiety that it would instantly negate any hope I had of an erection right then as soon as I even considered it. Those were the years of the elusive boners. Many unfortunate apologies and hair pulling frustration at such a silly obstacle. Sometimes i would think to my junk "I mean we both want the same thing here don't we? I thought we were cool? Why are you giving me so much grief. 
I knew it wasn't a medical issue what with all the other erections I had all the time. I was just pure and simple, psyched out. The pussy had gotten into my head, and bad. 
Condoms definitely did not help. 
There was no magic sudden cure. It took me having a whole lot of repeated sex with a chick with whom I was totally comfortable, and my mojo came right back. 
My dick just didn't like strangers I suppose. 
Once we got our self confidence back though boy let me tell you what....oh the escapades. The recklessness. The frivolity. Dare I say- the outright promiscuity!?  
Nah. It would make a nice story but no. My cock and I are both shy. The one one night stand I did manage to pull off was in huge thanks to an irresponsible amount of booze I had to drink to get physically and mentally prepared for what I was about to do. No sir, had I been in my right mind, it would've been a complete and total failure. A shit show if you will
TLDR used to have performance anxiety impotence. Probably still do. Luckily, I know a nice girl who has been letting me do whatever I want to her for the last 5 years or so. No more sex w strangers and no more prophylactics. Worked wonders for my woodies. 
Posting things on the internet. Idk, it isn't like I am worried that someone will read my comment and be like "WOW WHAT A JACKASS, THIS GUY SUCKS. I AM GOING TO HURT HIM/HUMILIATE HIM SOMEHOW". It's just that I tend to type way too much when I am posting any sort of comment or status update etc and I worry that it may get on people's nerves. Also, (and I realize this is a bit selfish) I don't like making sections because I feel like I dont get enough of my message across when people skip ahead to those (even though they are mostly just used for a summary or clarification). It's not a common problem for most people, and I tend to be pretty concise when in person. Oh well.
Depends, ranks aren't very static, some people hover between 4 ranks, I know people who hover between GE and low eagle. So I can't really answer this completely, then the term "good" is very subjective.
Good how? Good for an individual pub player? Good for a team? Ranks aren't really reflective; I've seen GE's stomped by DMG's. 
Anyone with more than &gt;100~ wins should know this.
What about consistency? Good in what respects? Some players either go 5-20 or 30-2.
There is a whole laundry list of ways to define this, but as a tl;dr
**DMG and above is "good".**
Lol screaming parents are the best. I was in a modern warfare 2 game a couple of months after it first came out and everyone was aware of "No Russian" So this mom comes on after hearing some guys and I in the lobby chirping her son (who had been calling everyone fags, cunts, pussy's but suddenly stopped when his mom came in.) so she puts on his mike and starts yelling at us telling us we should be ashamed of ourselves blah blah blah. Now believe me when I tell you that everyone in this game went after this mom asking her what kind of a terrible parent she is letting her son play a game like this, asking her if she was cooking meth and thats why she didnt know about the game being so violent. anyway this went on for like an hour before she rage quit haha.  Fucking with stupid parents its awesome   
I had an ex whose mother had this mentality. Her son was constantly in and out of therapy because he was pretty disturbed. He would claim he saw things (murderers, ghosts, etc) he would also make death threats towards his family. 
One day his mom after receiving a suggestion from one of his professionals asked me if I could help her tell which games were good for someone his age. She couldn't believe the M rated games were not ok. After all video games are for kids. In the end she took them away for a day but then gave him them back when he began to cry because he wanted them.
To be honest I still believe he doesn't have any mental issues other than being manipulative because when I dealt with him he knew I didn't take shit and he never ended up giving me any. Whats worse is they had multiple professionals tell them the same thing but it was more convenient to believe he had the problem and that it wasn't the mothers parenting. So when a professional told her to change parenting styles she just went to another professional until they agreed with her.
 Mother believes son to be mental but lets him play M games at a young age anyways.
My parents regularly use sexual innuendo around us kids and I mean CONSTANTLY. This is how I'd accidentally found out about several of their fetishes and also how long my dads cock is exactly. Beyond that, thy cant seem to understand that iMessages works on more than one device, so ill be working on my moms laptop when BOOM! Full on sext I wish I could clear my mind of. There are pictures too that they have a bad habit of leaving open on their computer... They assume that none of us would get the innuendoes since they've only gone over the very basic talk, and it goes over the rest of the kids heads, but they've sadly underestimated the power of the Internet. Example: my 10 year old sister was eating a cupcake and making mildly orgasmic noises while saying how good it is, really nothing that weird, but then my dad proceeds to judge my mom and wink, saying, "she gets it from you dear" What.The.Fuck. I need a mind wipe... Don't make sex jokes around your children and never underestimate the power of the internet
Well, it's kinda been on and off with regards to the naming. In Australia and possibly England, the GR (2008-2014) STi was badged as "WRX STi". In Japan, it was called a "WRX STi" on the web site but only got "STi" badges.  In Canada and the USA, the GR STi was just called an "STi" and then badged as "Impreza STi".
The 2015 now says WRX STi again on the web site (Canada and USA), but the car only has STi badges - no WRX **or** Impreza to be seen.
Subaru doesn't even know what it's really called or what badges to put on it.
&gt;shamelessly linking to your own ad driven site on someone else's site isn't ok. plain and simple.
Except that that is the whole point of reddit, sharing links of things you find cool.
&gt;OC is great and all, but this behaviour was not ok or even great.
&gt;i think content that does get posted here to reddit on a regular basis and is rehosted on imgur is bullshit, but on the same token spamming your own ad driven site on reddit or any other site is bad taste at best, and generally is goind to get you banned.
&gt;on a regular style forum, sure link your site in your sig, but don't just spam links to it unsolicited constantly.
&gt;there's actually a word for that - spam. and it's the same thing in this case as the shit that piles up in your junkmail folder.
TIL 1 link every other week is spam. Not to mention his content hit frontpage regularly. Plus [This]( doesn't look full of ads to me, it has as many as reddit does.
&gt;frogman was being an obnoxious tit with advertising his ad driven blog. if it were my site he'd get a friendly warning then his posts would start getting removed, and if it continued after that (though i'd be happy to explain what is happening to him or anyone else who asked so we were all on the same page), he'd get banned. plain and simple.
&gt;if he did it on his first post though, it'd be an autoban the same as spam bots.
Did you miss my point where I said that he wasn't only posting his own content? I posted a link to his submissions, it's about a 60/40% divide between his content and others. Not to mention the only reason he ever came here was because people posted his content here, and  with his /r/funny ban it's STILL posted regularly here. The admins of reddit are smart enough to see all this, and that's why they didn't ban him, it's only the /r/funny mods being overzealous and banning him but keeping the content.
&gt; do more than just link your shitty blog and you won't get modded. rule #1 of the internet here folks.
Except that people people like SMBC, XKCD, HaaH, C&amp;H, Oatmeal, etc do NOTHING but that on here and instead get special flairs for it. They're even worse than frogman at it since 100% of their posts are about it, instead of 60% like frogman. He's been singled out for no reason.
Explain this one to me:
So op got this picture without knowing who the frogman was. If he didn't know who he was, he couldn't have gotten it from frogman's website. Logically, this means that this must be a repost, as OP would have had to have gotten the picture from an outside source.
Op is a faggot
EDIT: Checked karmadecay, looks like this is the first time this image was posted on reddit, so OP got it from somwhere else, but not from frogman.
&gt;what if i told you very little what gets called OC on reddit is actually anywhere even vaguely original content.
So because of that we shoud turn away actual OC? Having 99% of content be reposts isn't a good reason to turn OC away, it's a reason to get more. The actual rules do have "don't spam" as the first rule, but frogmans content fits into "OK: Submitting links from your own site, talking with redditors in the comments, and also submitting cool stuff from other sites." AND "NOT OK: Submitting only links to your blog or personal website.", though for the second one he doesn't exactly do that and [just posts mostly his own content]( not only his own content (though the FAQ disagrees with me on that, though I think it to be ludicrous). Not to mention the fact that he's only banned on /r/funny, not reddit, showing that the admins think what he does is fine, only the /r/funny mods think it isn't.
&gt;and that the OP of this thread barely qualifies in itself, and is best fair use of someone else's content. except for the fact he commericializes it, so except for the parody/satire angle, it probably wouldn't stand up in court unless he removed the part of the image which he has no rights to.
It's called being a nice citizen, hell bloody reddiquette tells you to do it, which you pointed out here:
&gt;and actually shameless self promotion is like the first part of rediquette. while not being a hard rule, it's just being a good citizen whether youre on reddit or 4chan or timbuktu johnny fuck face forums #75756
Which helps me to point out how broken reddiquette is, it's meant to be an "Informal guideline" but it rarely followed, and that's because it it at war with itself, many of the do &amp; do nots, like it says to find orginal content, but also says to post only 10% of content you yourself make, it says to not be annoyed at reposts, but that you should find out if it was posted before. It is in a broken mess, and the admins need to actually clean it up, since keeping it mostly the same since 2005 hasn't worked out well at all. Hell, the rules, redditquette AND the FAQ don't say anything about [NP]( yet people are banned left right and center for it, and a huge fuss about bridaging is made, despite nothing in the actual rules, unofficial rules, or the backup for the unofficial rules saying anything about it.
 The treatment of frogman simply points out the bullshit reddit enforces that needs to be looked at.
shamelessly linking to your own ad driven site on someone else's site isn't ok. plain and simple.
OC is great and all, but this behaviour was not ok or even great.

I disagree with the caveat that it would require wise reinvestment in the transfer market. Basically without Suarez you lose 30ish goals and 15 assists (based on this season). That is a lot. You also lose the intangibles, which in some sense is a bigger loss (and basically irreplaceable). But I think that we could sell Suarez and still add to the trophy chest next year.
First, Sturridge has the potential to be the best striker in the world (the only thing holding him back is decision making, really). He's not even in his prime. Just think about that. 
But right now we score basically no goals from midfield (not counting Gerrard's PKs) and very few from the wings. Reinvesting the money can make up for the measurable loss of Suarez's goal contribution and (perhaps just as importantly) replace or rotate some under-performing starters (I'm looking at you, first-choice fullbacks). And (as distasteful as I find the idea) we can spend some real money getting a real replacement for Gerrard who is in or entering his prime (someone like a Vidal). 
Yes, yes a complete squad replacement negatively affected Spurs (at least, initially). But we don't need that kind of overhaul. One striker (remember Borini is coming back too), one versatile mid with a goal threat, at least one full back, maybe a wide forward/winger. Plus Suso is coming back, Teixera is going to be a player, Ibe is an even surer prospect and Jordan Rossiter is a 5 star scouse hero in FM.
Of course, I'd prefer to have Suarez retire a red (we certainly deserve that based on the support he's received after literally biting an opponent). But it wouldn't be the end of the world and more importantly, it doesn't have to halt the club's momentum. 
 FUck a Suarez lol 420 blaze it yolo toure
It's purely based on labor rates and the west coasts inflated wages don't change things drastically. According to that article the Chinese labor works for 1/5th the wages so 80% savings. OR is somewhere around 25% increased from normal American wage rates(80-25=55% savings over somewhere else in the US). The cost of shipping only consumes 20% of the cost and in this case the 80% saved on labor outweighs the 20% on shipping (shipping would be different to somewhere in the U.S. with lower wages and need to be calculated to be able to compare. Wild guess is the shipping would cost more too) Plus the article claims the Chinese labor is more efficient and gets more usable fish meat increasing their yield. Also the fishing company has less liability if they hand the product off. If something happened at their facility or their workers somehow made a mistake resulting in lost product they just have to eat the cost of it. If the processor they sell it to makes a mistake the fishing company doesn't take a loss. They were already way ahead just on labor rates and then combine reduced risk and product that goes further and is therefore more valuable. Huge financial win for the fishing company.
Edit: according to [the government]( Alaska's median fishing industry wage is only 80 cents an hour lower than Oregon's 
Edit 2: Chinese workers are 80% cheaper in an industry that heavily relies on manual labor. The shipping industry is really good at what it does and is super cheap.
The fish are caught well off the coast of Alaska, sometimes up to 200 miles from the coast.  When a fishing boat has salmon on board, they will typically meet up with a larger floating processor boat that will take their fish and process them on board by either freezing, filleting, or even canning at sea.  This saves time and money for both the fisherman (they don't have to run the fish all the way back to the processor at the dock), and the processor (who gets fresher fish and can move their operation anywhere it is convenient). Once the frozen fish is on the processor, it is not too much more work to just take it straight to Asia where there is a significantly better market for selling it.  I don't believe that much of the fish that is shipped to Asia ever is sent back to the united states however.  It is consumed in Asia, mostly Japan.  I should point out that most of the fish are caught way down the Aleutian Chain which is the part of Alaska that stretches WAY out toward Japan. 
Source: I am an Alaskan salmon fisherman.  
The fish are caught and processed way the hell out in the Pacific Ocean and its easier and cheaper to take the fish straight to Japan where they eat that shit up and pay top dollar.  Almost none of the fish sent to Asia comes back to the US.  
EDIT: More gooder words
Hey, Kor'galler here, so I guess I can give you my thoughts on this!
I used to play on heavy populated realms but migrated to Kor'gall mainly to play with my GF, but I learned to looove how empty it was, all rares were always up, you could do whatever you wanted, there was litteraly no other players there, but now with the connected realms it has gotten worse. It's more players, sure, but right now it's not quite enough players to be a good server, and too many players to be the low populated server I migrated to.
TL:DR; We're some kind of weird inbetweeners, too many to be a properly functioning server, too few to be a lowpop server and the AH is a mess.
&gt; I am looking to run titanfall when it is released on max but am not sure exactly what to upgrade.
That rig might well be capable of it. We can't tell you for sure what will max it until it's released.
&gt; I was thinking about getting an 770 but I am not sure if my cpu would hold it back. 
The i5 3570k is not going to hold anything back for years.
&gt; Also (bit off topic), what is the different in 770s? I see multiple 2GB versions in a £50 difference.
Different companies each have their own cooling solution et al and charge different prices. Some companies will also overclock the card themselves - they'll charge extra because they're a company and they don't do people favours for free. The overclocks tend to be rather mild so I wouldn't necessarily assume you're getting a card which will overclock better than others. How well your hardware will overclock is always random to some degree.
**** A 770 is a 770. Get a cheap one from a good brand and overclock it yourself if you want it OC'd.
To anyone thinking, "Aww, poor doggie! What a horrible owner!", relax.  Dingo knows what's up.  He's getting love(and probably treats) for being such a good table.  He cares way more about getting those than he does about the minor inconvenience of amusing /u/Kittenpuncher5000 (although, admittedly, as I just typed that username, I'm now having some uncertainty).  Look at what we humans go through(semi-voluntarily), just for extra treats like PCs and internet access.  
 If Dingo *really* wasn't that into it, he'd have picked his head up/stood up, and OP's couch would be wearing that drink before he/she could've even taken this pic.
The issue is they don't; not really.  There are other alternatives available to least At&amp;T.  Now is the connection as fast?  No.  But the option is there and to the people making the rules that's good enough.  That means no monopoly and everything is good. It like having some one trapped in a well; "Are you alive down there? Yes?, good, well then have a nice day."

&gt; The cables and infrastructure are NOT cheap.
True but most companies dont have to run all of the cable since much of it is provided byt the city.  Many lines are leased by the city to the ISP.  In some cases there are even more people "owning" part of the line.  
&gt;So they are granted monopolies by the government... but its worth noting that they are heavily regulated to protect consumers.
When they start running cables out to BFE, that's when things get expensive and they don't want to do it.  Honestly, why would they?  If you had a business selling hotdogs from a cart you sell them to the places that are easy for you to get to.  You don't go out of your way to push that cart up a big ass hill to sell one hotdog when a crowd of people is already down at the bottom.  But I digress. 

The companies want to maximize profits while spending as little money as possible.  Here's where the problems come in and why people are so unhappy with most providers. So, ISPs look at their infrastructure pie. They have 8 slices of delicious infrastructure pie but 10 people want a slice. They know most users just have internet for basic functions; email, browsing, shopping etc.  Not everyone is going to eat a full slice.  Instead of dedicating a full slice for each person and baking another pie for the other 2 people; they sell all 8 slices to 10 people.  This system works pretty well, most people dont see that the advertised 20mbs down they pay for is really only 10. The pages load and life goes on.  The problems start when that 8 slice pie starts serving the some-teenth person and some of those users watch Netflix and play games or run a minecraft server or host a website.  Then the little tos writing comes into play.  "Well you are paying for speeds up to 20mbs but 5mbs is acceptable."  Acceptable for whom?  Re-size the issue to millions of users, phones and devices that call home and do thing automatically, (updates etc).    The issue becomes huge and the amount of pies you need to bake becomes incredibly costly, so they don't and people are kinda stuck.  That really didnt retort the statement... sorry.  
&gt; So they are granted monopolies by the government... but its worth noting that they are heavily regulated to protect consumers.
They are regulated but its to prevent them absolutely raping end users and changing the content available to them.  There was a study just recently done, google it yourself, that showed the profit margins on data were in the 90% and up.  Thats not protecting consumers, its protecting business interests and lining pockets.  They could use some of that money to create more and better infrastructure while still earning a profit.  When was the last time someone told you that their internet bill just got cheaper?  Exactly, cause its never happened.  We've been on an increase cost per mbit since dial up.  

 There is a lot of money and politics involved with it and when you mix those two, things get foggy.  


Look through OP's posting history.  They seem to be quite fond of using three commans instead of the accepted ellipses of three periods...

Howdy! I do a lot of background acting to pay the bills. It's my only job ATM. Here's my uh, well, how I do it: (spoiler, it's a wall of text)
1) I'm SAG. That makes a HUGE difference. Non-union TV pays $64/8 with little to nothing in the way of bumps, meal penalties (what they give you if they're late feeding you) Surviving on NU is possible, but HARD.
2) I too am registered with Central Casting and I update my photo about quarterly - every 6 months even though my look hasn't really changed. Why? Because at union visiting (which you should go to as often as possible - you sign a sheet letting the casting directors know you were there and it DOES help you get booked) the casting directors said that they typically only look through file photos that are no older than 6 months. If/when you're union, go to visiting often and take the stand-in class. Every little bit helps. 
3) I'm also registered with Sande Alessi, Headquarters Casting, Creative Extras, Dixie Webster, Commercial Extras, and Extra Extras (the last two being commercial companies) and a few others that are union BG companies. I also have a profile with LA Casting, which I found has WAY more postings for background work than Actor's Access (especially for Union, but also for Non-Union) Register with anyone and everyone you can. Maintain all those profiles with fresh photos. 
4) I have a good calling service - they work with companies besides Central (they're the biggest game in town, but it helps to have them booking me with other companies when things slow down for hiatus). Sometimes you have to "shop around" a bit before you find one that works for you. I don't know what your availability is, but it helps if you don't have any scheduling conflicts. If you're not available on certain days regularly, you'll get overlooked a lot. 
5) Know your background "type". Maybe it's different than your "real" type. What can you convincingly play without too much work? If you're younger and have longish hair, you can play downscale, hipster, hippie, etc. If you're clean cut and have neatly trimmed hair, keep your hair neatly trimmed and have a decently fitted black suit. Since I bought a suit and updated my photo at Central with the black suit, I work more than I ever did as non union, and I don't have to be a club goer or a "model type". It sounds flattering at first to be a "hot model type" but being pawed at and hit on whilst wearing 5" heels for up to 15 hours fucking blows. I'd rather be a "lawyer" or "White House staffer", you know?
6) Keep your costs down as much as possible. Use public transit, live in a cheaper place if you can, etc. If you make less than I think $1100 a month, you qualify for food stamps. I've been on food stamps and unemployment before (I've been through some SHIT) It's better than starving and getting evicted. That help is there for when you need it. Don't be ashamed. You don't have to fucking broadcast it to the world either, but take help if you need it. 
7) When you DO get booked: a) ALWAYS BE VERY EARLY. Like, 30-45 minutes before your call time for parking, trekking across the lot, etc. Don't ever be late. b) ALWAYS BRING A TON OF WARDROBE OPTIONS - having extra options has gotten me overtime (and even extra spots on commercials!) more times than I can count - and all of that adds up! Even though I'm union and don't HAVE to bring tons of wardrobe for TV, I do anyway and it makes a good impression c) BE NOT AN ASSHOLE. Be pleasant, don't be creepy, don't shit talk about anyone (wardrobe lady was a bitch, I hate this guy, etc) don't voice your opinions on politics and religion, even if "everyone else" is. Don't stand too close to people being assholes, because people might wrongly associate you with them.  d) PAY ATTENTION to what you're supposed to do and when, and don't run into principal actors and cameras, don't fuck around on your phone, etc  e) DON'T BE A N00B i.e.: violating NDAs (non-disclosure agreements), taking pictures of sets, the actors, the costumes, and posting it to social networks, stealing food from crafty, asking for autographs. I've seen it happen &gt;_&gt; **WHY?** Because making a good impression DOES get back to the people in charge. Because the PA's *will* personally request to have you back on the show again. That means more work. LA is a big city, but the industry is really a small town. Word gets around. I've been a "regular" and a recurring extra on quite a few shows because most of the time, I can STFU and make everyone else's job easier. (you probably know this, but a lot of people don't, so, I'm putting it out there for people just starting out) 
So, **TL; DR**: Be union, buy a suit, network, register with everyone, be not an asshole, be reliable, keep your living expenses down. 
I used to work in EPCOT for two and a half years. Guests have a game where they "drink around the world". They have to have a drink at every countries pavilion. Many people take it very seriously and even have shirts for us to sign with sharpies, and will finish with a picture. Anyway I worked in a country where I was your last stop or first stop. Being the last stop gets sticky sometimes because the people can be quite intoxicated and as the server of beer I'm responsible for not putting them overboard. Long story short a huge muscle guy got up in my face when I refused to serve him. He couldn't stand without the help of his friends. They were nice enough and helped him away with security when he was done making some violent threats against me. None of those situations ever escalated past security having to come, the most intoxicated person usually has friends who help talk them down.
Muscle man threatening me because I wouldn't serve him.
Like I said, as a guy who has been there....
I was infatuated with a woman who was teasing me for a year at my work. Her husband stayed at home with the kids, and she worked 2 jobs to support the family. I thought he was a giant douche and felt sorry for her at first. Then I spent time working with her and we talked about a LOT of things. I felt like I could tell her anything. So I started to open up a bit.
It was just a friendship for me right? Nothing could go wrong, I was just talking! Then I quit my job to open up my own business, but I would still stop in from time to time to see how she was doing. I said "Good friends check in on each other!" and they do.
Soon it was emails. We would email each other back and forth for a short while and then we started to hang out just the two of us. I would let her vent about her situation and she would let me vent about mine. Both of us knew that neither of us would leave our spouses, but it felt good to know that as crappy as some of life's situations were, we had a bond that was awesome.
Sometime in the middle of that I started to feel different about her. I would dream about her in the night. I would wonder "What if things were different?" I started to think about her in a much more provocative way. I knew it could never happen, but it was a fun fantasy to have.
Needless to say, my wife found my emails and her husband found hers. Neither of us said anything TOO bad, so I was able to mend the fences with my wife. But I will always be missing that little bit of my heart that I should have given to my wife and instead gave to another woman. I still think about her from time to time. Similar to how you would think about an ex that left on good terms and you'll never see again.
The mind of a man is a weird thing. We need encouragement, praise, admiration, respect, and physical touch. Sure he could possible see you as a friend, but 2-3 times a week he's going out with you on a quasi-date. And during that time he is getting the excitement of a date without the pressure of the relationship. It's a nice feeling to have. But it's false feelings for him. 
He does see you as a friend. He always will see you as a friend. But to keep him as a friend, you need to ask yourself if you are willing to be second-fiddle to his wife. Because I can tell you all the excuses I used with my wife. "I'll be home late, I'm going out with the guys!" "No guy showed up, it was just *****, so I stayed to be polite and then I left shortly after" "I'm going to go hang out with 'guy friend' and watch a movie ok?" 
I know I'm transposing my own situation into yours, but as a guy, I can tell you that this is a very dangerous situation to be in. Not physically, but emotionally. It's very easy for a married man who has his wife complaining about something that he should have done, but didn't, to think about how his female friend doesn't bitch at him, she doesn't nag him to do something, and she is always there when he needs to vent.
In married life we forget how to date each other a lot of times. We take for granted the laughter and remember the arguments. So when a pretty girl comes into the picture the temptation to give her a little friendly attention is strong, and if we as men don't watch out, pretty soon our stupid brains will confuse a friendship with a relationship.
I wish you the best. I do. I hope that he and you both share the idea that you are just friends. Let me offer you some questions to pose to him.
* Hey, some of our coworkers think we have a 'thing' going on. We're just friends right?
* Just curious, but is your wife cool with us hanging out?
* You have any cute guy friends?
These three questions will a) establish that you guys are just friends, b ) establish if he is hiding you from his wife (RED FLAG) and c ) help him to understand that you aren't interested in him sexually but just friends.
Good luck!
- Ask him some questions that will help you to know if you guys are just friends in his head or something more.
my uncle (a fox news type conservative) was railing on about how climate change isn't real and all the scientists were lying; because reasons. "I don't believe in all the global warming mumbo jumbo!" he says. so I says to him, I says, "it doesn't matter if you believe it, it's happening".
I spent the next half hour regretting having said anything.
 science doesn't require belief to happen. 
While I mostly agree with you, there is a line where that's not true, and it really is more about your use of the word science.  Science means what to you?  Would you consider string theory science?  String theory can be understood and not believed.  In fact, that's where a lot of scientists are with that issue.  Science, the procedure, the act of science, of exploration and hypothesis and testing and study, that is an act, not a belief.  The results that come from those tests are, to an extant, beliefs.  We believe that the laws of physics hold up all throughout the universe.  We believe that they have been the same since the beginning of time.  And we, much like the people putting the puzzle together, can make very educated guesses as to what the empty puzzle holes are, but we can't know until we find them.  We fills those holes in with beliefs.  We draw our own lines that make the most sense to try and complete the puzzle, and then we try to prove that those lines are correct by finding the puzzle piece somewhere hidden in the universe.  But really, we can't ever know, no matter how much we understand, exactly what was in that hole before we see what's in the hole.  Newton thought he had quite a bit figured out, he filed in his own holes as best he could with his beliefs, but he was wrong about a few of them.  The same can be said for every scientist (or any one person for that matter).  We do the best we can with the experiences we have, some of us just prefer to be more methodical in how we fill in our missing puzzle pieces and some of us prefer to rely on faith or feelings.
/u/kingsmuse said it best, "Science is a system that supports many beliefs.
It's much better support for a belief system than religion."
Man, OP could be screwed either way.  The only other choice is mommy staying home with the kid, listening to the kid throw up from the couch and watching The Price Is Right while you're stuck doing your work AND mommy's work.  Talk about a rock and a hard place.  Either way, I'm glad I have a large private office with a door (that locks!) so even when kids turn up, I can shut them out.  
 On the bright side, you're not stuck doing mommy's work!
This. Even if he did live in an area where there is a large gay social population, most of the ones that go out and are social are younger (in their early twenties to mid thirties). Just remember /u/Phaesus, you can still be yourself, even though you're out. I am sure I can figure out how strange it can be for a recently uncloseted older gay man. When I used to go to the gar bars with my friends, most of the older men there were creepers who gave off weird vibes and tried to get my friends to blow them. Not cute. However, you may be able to get in touch with some other older professional gay men through social websites. If you live near a big town (like Cincinnati or Los Angeles for example) check out their subreddits to see if there are any activities going on there. If you are from a smaller town (like mine) check something like Adam For Adam (I am guessing you might know what that is) I don't know what all you can search for on A4A but I am sure you can probably find people that are around your age that do want to hang out and do more than just hook up if that's what you are into.
TL:DR-Advice from a Hag that might help.
I think what you're mentioning here is game sense. As in, where will the enemies typically be, how to pick them off efficiently, etc etc... I'm afraid that that comes with experience. Let's set up a scenario real quick.
Someone on your team gets a pick in B (dust 2), so you decide to push B together. By now, if the enemy team realizes you're all in B, they will start to rotate. Typically, they will push out CT spawn, A long or short and go through B tunnels to prepare for the retake. Personally, what I like doing when I call is, if I still have all 5 members alive, leave one in mid to pick off rotaters. The reason I do this is because, by experience, I've learned that people often come out of long / short. You'll get better the more you play, simple as that really. Knowing the standard positions of the enemy team is also great. For example, in dust 2 it's often 1B, 1 mid, 1 short, 2 long (it can vary but usually sticks to something similar). As you repeat this, you'll slowly comprehend where to place your crosshair so that you get a clean HS as the CTs rotate out, and you'll find different positions that give you an advantage.
One last thing: when looking at your radar, any area which is not controlled by your team should be considered hostile territory, and enemies are most likely there. You gain knowledge by having your team spread across the map.
Logistics wise, a lot of tutorials can help you with aim, proper grenade throwing, stutter-stepping... Look up "TheWarOwl" and "adreN iBUYPOWER" on YouTube to get tips and tricks. They're both great resources (I'm on mobile device so can't link, sorry :s).
Hope this helps in one way or another.
TL:DR; Occupy as much of the map as possible to get better intel, know standard positions for each maps (helps with pre-shooting), learn crosshair placement and spray patterns (the YouTube tutorials) and play some more. :)
My suggestion is to see how much they offer you, and if you're willing to sell it for that, do it. I know this sounds kinda stupid and obvious, but what I mean is, don't get hung up over it. 
If they offer you $500, and you think to yourself "its just a stupid instagram name" sell it, if you feel "that doesnt seem right, and all my friends will need to get my new name, and it just seems like a hassle" then dont
Dont let anyone else tell you what its worth, because honestly, the whole thing is REALLY subjective. Also remember, its not a name like @pizza, where dominos, pizza hut, papa johns, etc... will be fighting over it. You have a unique name, that happens to be the same as a single company (so limited market) and remember, they can just as mentioned in other posts, they can easily just use @faenahotels or something like that, so really they're not even buying the name they're buying the convenience of having a shorter handle.
 take what you can get for it, maybe negotiate up a little, remember it seems like its a market of one so if you reject it you just turned down the one and only offer you'll probably ever get.
I know that I am playing the devils advocate here, but maybe at this time in your life, you need to go find yourself. Therapy is an excellent choice and there are therapists and psychiatrists all over the globe who will be able to "cure" you. More specifically, they will be able to help you cope with whatever /u/desirebutdontdemand, /u/colakoala200, and /u/johnnycastaway have diagnosed you with.
I don't know you, but im going to give you some straight up advice I have been successful with. I may be crazier than you or vice/versa, but this worked for me. Triathalons, working out at the gym, yoga, cycling, swimming, etc will change your life and literally give you a completely different life, so different from the last you would not believe. Im suggesting you take a year or 2 off from dating, join a triatholn club, masters swimming, gym etc and start focusing your time on a goal that completely evolves around the inner self. The only actions you are doing are to better your health. I know it is bullshit in writing, but I promise you. If you start running local races, competing in triathlons, taking care of your body, you will literally be reborn after 3 - 6months 1 - 2 years omg. 
Maybe it wont cure you of your "disorder" but it will change how you think. And here is the best part. Triathlons are full of crazy women just like you and me. All you need to do is train a bit so you dont die and then meet her afterwards at the beer tent, no problem you just finished a 5k and are full of adrenaline and confidence. The women you're about to approach may be just as crazy as you.
-  you have the ability to change yourself and no matter how crazy you are. 
Indeed.   (Copypasta below)

* [The Stratfor leaks indicate that Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian runs a marketing firm called Antique Jetpack with reddit General Manager Erik Martin.](
* On March 14, 2011, Alexis met with Stratfor employees at their offices, presumably to pitch Antique Jetpack's services to them.
Antique Jetpack is a hard trail to follow and their website is hardly informative--Alexis and Erik clearly want to make the trail as hard to follow as possible--but here's a link to it:

&gt; Anyone can claim a religious affiliation to any extent of orthodoxy
This is a desperate last-ditch attempt to be allowed to wear a beard, but there is a legal definition of "religious affiliation" and you're required to meet it to get an exemption. You can't just claim you're a Muslim or something and therefore can't shave. You need the assertion of a religious organization to qualify. I, personally, have terminated people for lying about their religious affiliation in order to get around rules (though not at Publix). It's a real thing, it really happens.
 Stop making this argument, it's stupid and you have no idea how the world works.
Get a forced air respirator and you won't have to have a seal against your skin we got them at my job and the lifted the beard ban. It's like a head bag with a air pump that is on a belt that goes on your waiste 
Dont have to shave with all respirators 
If the minimum payment is $100 on a $400 balance, and you pay $100, you won't have any negative impact on your credit score. However, you will accrue interest on the other $300 you didn't pay. If you paid $50 and the minimum payment is $100, that will negatively impact your credit score (since you didn't pay your minimum), and you'll pay interest on $350. 
 pay **at least** the minimum, but ideally the whole thing. Otherwise you're paying interest for your rewards, and the rewards aren't "free" anymore.
There are many ways to roast a bean.  The stage that you are talking about - that is, a few seconds before the "shiny" phase - is called Full City.  The roast is taken into what is called the second crack, which is the second chemical reaction that happens in a roast.
The first chemical reaction that happens in coffee is called the first crack.  Once the first crack happens, the beans become consumable.  Depending on the bean, anytime between or during these two reactions, can produce an amazing-tasting coffee.  The "shiny" phase that you are speaking of is called a Vienna or French roast.  Some roasters would consider this roasted too much, but coffee is about personal preference, as much as it is about what people say is "right" or "wrong."
there's no "perfect" phase that is the same for every single coffee bean.  A good roaster finds a roast profile that will accentuate the natural flavours and nuances of each individual varietal.
First posting on my area of expertise here 😃...PhD in mktg/consumer behavior/psychology. 
As others have pointed out, the '38 study is in fact outdated and IQ is an antiquated intelligence measure. 

Advertising is a complex phenomenon in study, and there are myriad factors that are considered. In general practice however, they are not designed to target different "intelligence" segments. An ad exec commented below referring to ads using different execution cues such as humor, in order to maximize brand recall, when considering options to satisfy a need.

Another concept widely studied in advertising is "how do we as individuals process ad information?" Understanding this was deemed more important than figuring out what cues aid brand recall. This led to the development of something called the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty &amp; Cacioppo 1986)...Which tries to incorporate the partitioning of cognitive resources, to understand what routes consumers use to analyze ads. Based on individual characteristics, we may process information along a "central route" wherein an ad that presents a strong coherent message can be more effective in persuading us vs. Along a "peripheral route"  where the cues such as model attractiveness,  music, flashy pictures etc. Lead to more brand recall....I teach on these topics and can write a ton of boring/fun pages on them...but I'll leave that for another time. 

  In good advertisements, myriad factors are considered and constantly interacting to draw some of your cognitive resources (brain power).

I am somewhat confused. I have not read Hunger Games, but I checked the wiki, and it says the male tribute from District 7 is Blight? Where did David come from? Whoever, he is, I really enjoy his apathetic, sarcastic attitude.
Just reading the opening, it sounds like David and Johanna absolutely detest each other, but later they fall into a sort of natural comaraderie. Is there any way you could tone down the first couple paragraphs? 'Boomed' and 'shouted' seem particularly violent.
When Johanna changes the subject, it feels quite awkward. I get that it's not supposed to flow, but it just seems to come completely out of nowhere.
From what I see, your first section mainly just conveys information that a HG fan would already know. Personally, I'm all for expositing all the information that a casual fan would know and a total newcomer wouldn't. However, I think that if you're going to do this, you ought to go all the way. After reading this, I still don't really know much about your protagonist or his situation. I think if you took some time to add in description (of the characters, of the environment, etc.), the chapter would feel much less rushed.
If David just found out then that this Hunger Games would be drawn from previous victors, mild grumbling seems a bit of an underreaction.
I agree that the ending seems a bit awkward. If I were plotting this, I would probably try to make everything up through his selection into a single a chapter, and if you put more into setting the scene and developing your characters, this definitely seems plausible. 
I think the best writing comes after he wakes up, and he's waiting to be taken to the Capitol. I thought "five white uniforms walked up to his doorstep" particularly clever.
 The opening sounds like David and Johanna hate each other, and there was almost no description.
That I've been making excuses for myself pertaining to my unemployment. 
On one end of the spectrum, I pretty much am refusing to take jobs that pay minimum wage. I keep thinking that my degree means I should be able to get work that can support a grown-up life. Because, you know, having NO income is way more dignified. 
On the other, I'm not taking advantage of all the avenues available to get me on the right track professionally. I haven't, until recently, understood that starting at the bottom is a real thing. 
 I want good stuff handed to me with minimal effort on my part. 
Or I did. Now I'm excited about building myself up and feeling proud of something for once. 
I loved Clara from the beginning and still do, but they fucked up her entire arc. I mean, we started the season knowing she was the Impossible Girl, and they didn't do anything to advance that, merely kept reminding us over and over that she was impossible. 
The most excited I was during this last season was during the commercial break after the second Clara appeared at the haunted house. I was thrilled to finally be seeing yet another Impossible Girl.  And the biggest disappointment of the season was about 3 seconds back from the break when she revealed herself to be the Tardis. 
 Love Clara, hate what the writers did to her. 
no, every fistfight is not.  But its the old problem if escalation.  In this case, and many others including Zimmerman, the notion on trial in the mind of the shooter is 'I am being assaulted, and I am carrying a firearm.  If this person gets my firearm, what will happen?'
In this case, the presence of the firearm, and potential use of it against the holder justify actions of immediate retaliation against the opposing force.
This has almost always been grounds for killing in the USA.  Forget high school scruffles that people get into.  Two men fighting, not playing around like frat boys tussling with friends over car keys, but actual bloody fighting, is a nasty situation, and can often lead to hospitalization and permanent damage (broken bones, teeth out, concussions, etc.).
Someone comes at you, intends you hard, or you think they do (in some states with stand your ground laws, like FL) you are OK to defend yourself with lethal force.
This is the American way, Dont tread on ME.  Just because it gets abused in a few, highly publisized cases each year, doesn't mean that its wrong, or that people are carrying just looking for excuses to blow people away.
TL,DR unless you are a trained fighter, fistfights can and frequently do get out of hand and people are justifiably allowed to preempt a severe as beating with lethal force in many places.
I don't expect to be a ton of help, but I'll say what I can.
First, the best way to get better understanding and formulating any kind of proof is to read lots of proofs, and read them *actively*. By that, I mean that at each step you should be asking yourself why the author did whatever (s)he did. After a while you should begin to get a sense for "typical" proof techniques. It helps to seek those out, and talk about them with other people (especially those who have more experience than you do)
Now, about "for all" statements. These will look something like "for all widgets x, the statement P(x) is true". I think it's helpful to think of this as an implication: "x is a widget" implies "P(x) is true"
Looking at it this way, there are, broadly, two ways to go - direct proof, or proof of the contrapositive. Nothing is inherently less mathematically true about a proof of the contrapositive, but direct proofs are frequently more enlightening as to "why" a particular result is true.
Direct proof means (generally), you say "let x be a widget". You then go on, using only the fact that *you know it's a widget* to establish the truth of P(x). When I think about how to do this for a new problem, I usually spend a while just thinking about *why* all the properties of widgets are important to the truth of P(x), and as I clarify those reasons to myself, I begin to envision how to write the proof rigorously.
Proof of the contrapositive is often (by no means always) easier. The proof will look like: "suppose P(x) is false. Then x cannot be a widget". One way that this can be easier (while being less enlightening) is that there may be several ways in which x can fail to be a widget, and you only need to show that one of them holds when P(x) is false.
So, this was all enormously general. If you'd like some further elaboration with a specific example, let me know
- that's okay.
You really need to get to higher levels to fully appreciate the depth of PoE combat.  As the other person said, when you start getting attack speed, movement speed, life leech, projectile speed, cast speed, and support gems like multistrike, chain, fork, pierce, multi-trap, faster casting, melee splash, and hundreds more I am not thinking of...that simple skill you used on the beach which felt slow and sluggish will turn into a gorey bloody mess of corpses and destruction later in the game.
don't quit after the first couple of zones and then complain that the combat is slow.  The game is slow paced and it takes some work to reach a point where everything meshes.
Because it's absolutely ridiculous landing this jet.  This thing was point-designed to fly very very high.  EVERYTHING else was traded off for the sake of saving weight.  The flight controls might have light forces in one axis, very heavy forces in another (because to fix that would require hardware, which a weighs something, which reduces your max altitude...you see the logic). The U-2 doesn't take brand new Lts, fresh from flight school... It takes experienced pilots from all walks of Air Force life (as well as transitions from other services), and lets them try out.  If you show promise, you get a second flight; if not, you're sent packing.  If you are adapting quickly, you get a third.  If they think they'll be able to get you to solo, you may get picked up for the program.
The main wheel is a regular tire, and does the real work.  The rear wheel is more like a skateboard wheel... It's there because, well, bicycle is better than unicycle.  When you come in to land, you have a very narrow airspeed tolerance.  There's an AOA aural system, that gives you a tone in your helmet.  You have to listen, essentially, to see if you're on-speed, too fast, too slow.  Your desired touchdown is both wheels simultaneously, minimum rate of descent.  This is much harder than just landing both tricycle main gear simultaneously.  Landing main wheel first will cause the jet to bounce back in the air, but since the cg is aft of the main wheel, the tail keeps sinking, and you wind up airborne again, nose up... not comfortable.  If you have a high rate of descent that you try to salvage by getting a late flare, this will only exacerbate the nose-up bounce, potentially stalling you a few feet above the ground.  A tail wheel first landing can stress the tail, or cause porpoising between the gear.  That would also suck.  Chase gives you a good idea of your height (you can hear from the countdown if you're descending too quickly, and going to bounce it, or holding too long a few feet up, and going to stall).  He also works to talk both wheels onto deck at the same time (since you can't see them).
Once you've got both wheels on deck, you're riding an enormous bicycle to the next taxi offramp.  You can't stop in the runway, because when you do, the jet is going to pick a wing, and lean over on it.  So you keep your speed up, and try to keep the wings from dipping while you cruise along at highway speed.   The wings are long as hell, so what looks like a slight lean in the cockpit looks like a drunken wing drop to chase.  He helps you out with that.  You spend that time popping the yoke left and right to get the roll spoilers involved, keeping you as level as you can until you clear the runway.
This is a cool jet, but it should get your heart rate up in the landing pattern.
 Chase for a U-2 is about as necessary as an LSO on the boat.  It's a very unique experience; it wasn't made to land pretty.
  Well, I know our G+ group got infiltrated.  And there is a player with an account on both sides.  To varify people for our group, it is a rule to meet them in person now.  Seems reasonable. 
 If they wouldn't do anything with you only because they never met you, that's one thing.  But once there are mole concerns, how else do you deal with it?   What would you have preferred them do? Just accept that you MIGHT be on the other team and listening in to any long term plans?  I get you are casual, I don't play as much as many in my city, but I have done some bigger events, and I would have been sad if we left someone in the chat we knew could be spying on us and that screwed up some big event.  Actually cancel that, not would be sad, WAS SAD.  We had a guy with two accounts mess up an event.  He was invited to a G+ group, and destroyed an event, and prevented someone from keeping their 90 achievement, due to intel he learned from it.   Which hey, fair enough, we weren't careful, so it was on us.
 It sucks, but what alternative do you have for finding moles, which I am certain you are aware can and do exist?
Out of Universe:
In the Dresden Files, Harry Dresden explains that when he draws a circle or pentacle it is to help _him_ do the magic. The circle and pentacle provide clear boundaries to set his will upon and draw upon magic. It is completely possible to summon anything wihtout the use of a drawn circle, but every bit helps because if you mess up, ya die.

I always thought that the clapping of the arms is basically the same sort of thing. They are creating the "circle" that alchemy needs in the FMA universe and then imposing their will within their arms and hands. So I think it is possible that someone learned enough could do it. BUT since, the power they are channeling is volatile, every bit helps, so the normal alchemists use it and eventually they just believe they need to use the alchemical circles and markings.
Being exposed to the "Truth" allows for someone to realize that one only is imposing their will upon the world and channeling it into their surroundings. Since they are exposed to it in such a pure manner, it overrides any hesitations they have within their mind that would prevent the alchemical transformations from occurring.
 Alchemists _believe_ they need alchemical circles to manipulate their environs, so they _do_ need the circles. People with enough knowledge realize its just enforcing their will upon their surroundings and clap their hands together in a circle to focus the energy into their hands.
On my way down to South Georgia with some friends. As we get close, the urge hits. I have to shit. I get off some exit that has only a single gas station. I go into this gas station and run into the Men's bathroom. The single stall in there has caution tape all around it. I say fuck it, I gotta shit. So I crawl up under it and see brown shitty water literally bubbling in this toilet. Hell with this; I climb out and run across the hall to the women's bathroom. I notice there isn't anyone in there so I take one of two stalls in there and proceed to have a blowout. Like raise you off the seat because its coming out so fast.
Halfway through, the door opens and in comes three pairs of feet. One takes the stall next to me while the other two stare at themselves in the mirror. My asshole seals shut. The women next to me lets out this torrential pour of piss then calls out "Brittany, I started!!"  She asks them if they have a tampon and they say no, so I hear a knock on my bathroom stall wall. She then asks me if I have one. I call out in my girliest voice "No". The other two leave to go get her a tampon and I'm stuck in here with the period chick. She tries to have a conversation with me about inconvenient periods.
Now, at this point, I'm sweating because I have to finish this shit. Eventually, I can't hold it anymore. I release the kraken. The women starts gasping in horror. The smell is absolutely terrible. She gets her tampon and the girls haul ass out of there. I wipe my ass, wait a couple minutes and ditched that bathroom.
 Shit in women's restroom. Got asked for a tampon and have conversation about periods while impersonating a woman.
Freshman year of college i was in the communal bathroom, alone, taking a quick piss. Just as i had finished, flushed, but not quite left the stall, two girls came in talking about something gossipy and extremely personal. Not wanting to make them uncomformatable knowing a stranger from their hall knew such delicate information i thought 'oh ill just wait til they do their business and then slip out'. It was a friday night. They werent excreting anything, they were getting fully dolled up for a night of debauchery. After about 10 mins i was already in too deep. Itd be super creepy if i left before they did at this point. I was trapped for over an hour and my friends started texting me worried i had died. 
dont discuss highly personal information in the bathroom or your kind hallmate will spend an hour criss-cross-applsauce on the can
I was driving on the interstate at 2 AM in the morning, coming back from a fun weekend with friends, when my stomach starts to feel bad... real bad.
I'm in a rural part of Georgia and there is nowhere to stop. I'm starting to sweat profusely and am desperate for a place when I see a highway rest area. Easing into the dark, empty parking lot, I clench and fast walk it into the dimly lit men's room.
I just made it... violent flu symptoms rack my GI tract and I knew I would not be going anywhere for a while. That's when I first heard the slow shuffling of feet and an angry muttering voice making their way into the restroom. The one dim, bussing florescent bulb provided a sickly light while the dirty concrete walls ricocheted sound and bent it around me. The result was an environment where sound came from everywhere and objects did not cast shadows but became shadows themselves.
The stall door lock had gone missing long ago, so I leaned forward bracing my left hand against the stall door. Still sitting, while my right hand quietly opened a small pocket knife and held it inches from my sweating face.
The shuffling of feet and angry muttering stopped at my stall door and pushed. Every nerve in my body was sick, feverish and fearful. I could see dirty shoes topped with rags underneath my door. Rags encrusted with the filth that can only come from living in your clothes for years. "I'm in here." My ragged voice reverberated off of the cold concrete walls. He pushed harder next time.
I'm pouring sweat, my pants are around my ankles and I'm violently ill. I'm trapped on a toilet with a knife in my hand and a muttering mad hobo trying to enter the stall... then it got strange.
He stops pushing the stall door and enters the stall directly next to mine. I hear rustling, angry muttering, and then grunting. 5 minutes? 8 minutes? I don't know, because time stretched out and seemed eternal as I listened to what I can only describe as the sounds of a violent, very mentally ill man, masturbating in the stall next to me.
I was frozen in time and fear, bracing the door, watching the indistinct shadows under the stall wall for threats, while still racked with sharp painful contractions in my GI tract. I'm listening to the muttering, grunting and rhythmic sound of fabric moving while imagining having to fight for my life.
Time goes by...
He "finished" and I listened as he shuffled out of the bathroom. I'm still painfully ill for another 10 minutes. My every nerve was on edge as my ears strained, worried, listening for his shuffling footsteps to return.
Finally, I think I can get up and make my way through the dark parking lot to my car. I compose myself, open the stall door to leave, and see him standing silently next to the sink... staring at me.
My hand is still clenched in a fist with a blade sticking out of it as I lower my head and stare back at him. I have to maneuver within 3 feet him to exit and moved slowly past him not taking my eyes off of him. Out in the dark parking lot I break into a jog to the car and tear out of there, happy feel the cool night air.
 I didn't wash my hands one morning in a rest area.
I love this argument ... "we are not the creators so we should sit back and let them stick it to us".
People complain because they like this game and they hate what has happened to it ... but you are absolutely right that the devs don't need to listen to their users. You know what though, if they don't they are going to end up with very few of those users who will stick around (which strikes me as something they may not want).
There is a reason people expect some commitment and humility from indie developers. That reason is that they have a better bargaining position. You may be a drop in the bucket with a company like EA (which is why pissing off a few million people hasn't crippled their company) but every customer an indie game loses hurts them in more ways than one (spreading the word is important!).
 Overkill is free to do as they please with their game but if they don't start listening to their players any time soon they won't have any to speak of.
To me, it looks like 505 has Overkill by the balls. Trying to just push out as much DLC as possible. Based on everything OK did with PD1, this just isn't their norm. These weapon packs are completely unnecessary just because of the sheer amount of firearms the game has offered since day 1. The Death Wish difficulty itself had potential but a reskinned bulldozer and cops isn't going to be enough to get me to spend any money. Hell that's like me paying to get my ass kicked, when I can just play the normal Overkill difficulty and do that for free. 
It really does just look like 505 says "Hey, I've got a bigger whip this time! So in the next month or so you guys are going to get another full DLC released and that will be that." And the Overkill guys sit down and birth some ideas prematurely and give it a neat little trailer in the hopes that will help it sell better and that's it.
I played the armored transport mission was not all that impressed. It was fun once but when the mission was over I sat there wondering if there was going to be more but nope. 
 505 is beating Overkill shitless for more DLC and it really isn't pretty.
&gt; I love this argument ... "we are not the creators so we should sit back and let them stick it to us".
This is called a straw man fallacy, and I'd appreciate if you didn't do it again.  I didn't say we should sit back and do nothing, only that the devs have no obligation to do what we say if it conflicts with their vision for the game.  Here's a related example: Just because a large number of people say they want dinosaurs in Battlefield doesn't mean that DICE has to put them in, especially if they think it would not add to the game, or would even detract from it.  Same goes for Overkill here with regards to tweaking game mechanics.
&gt;  Overkill is free to do as they please with their game but if they don't start listening to their players any time soon they won't have any to speak of.
You know, I've played WoW for many years, and I've heard this argument too many times to count.  People who are dissatisfied tend to be the loudest bunch, whereas people who are satisfied tend to not be as loud or noticeable to the devs.  Unless the game takes a sharp downturn in the next week or two, I doubt the devs are going to take anyone who says this seriously.
I stopped masturbating recently but whenever I did, instead of wiping I would just eat it. I mean my gf loves to swallow and kiss me afterward, so I mean, I would taste myself anyways. You're not gay. Otherwise every woman who loves how they taste (my gf included) would be lesbian. 
I do it too, I'm not gay. You're good.
I went from 265 to 209 pounds in about a month, just eating 1500 kcal per day. It was hard mostly because my aunt owns a restaurant and my mother used to work for her, so every meal is king's size and quality.
After losing weight I still had man boobs, so I went to the gym 3 times a week for a year: same weight, but no more boobs and muscles I didn't know I had are now visible.
I still have fat around my belly, but nowhere else, mostly because I lifted weights but did not to much cardio. Now I dedicate one of those three gym days to the core zone, just to get rid of that belly fat.
 keep trying eating less and go to the gym. It's hard, I'm doing it and after more then a year it keeps being hard, but it works and makes you feel better.
If it's not malicious I see no problem with it. It's not your fault that your happiness and desire to watch the replays makes them emotionally upset. Maybe if they enjoyed the sport of the game more than winning they could appreciate watching something ridiculous or mundane just to get the experience. Manifest positivity and you'll enjoy yourself, manifest negativity and we'll... you'll have a bad time.
 get over it and enjoy the game guys
I was having the same problem, always frustrated and getting annoyed as shit by all of the sweat in UT. 
Then I stopped playing seasons and stick to cups/single matches. The difference is astounding. So much less sweat and bullshit. 
Also, I picked this up from Japes, use players you like, play your own style (currently attempting the tiki taka short passing high possession style now and is awesome), and use players you enjoy using, not just the OP guys. 
Seriously injected so much fun into UT. I don't worry myself about the W, just focus on playing my own style of fifa and having fun. 

 Play your own style, with your own players and go into it with a mindset of having fun, not necessarily for the W
I'm going to piggyback the OP and agree. 
I'm very new to FUT, but not FIFA. I play UT for fun because I don't have the time to dedicate to making absurd BBVA-BPL hybrids with IFs. So, I made a cheap Belgian Pro team made up only of African players. I play build up style and counter attack. It's fun even if I lose.
EXCEPT
when these people make super powerful teams and then just spam you. For instance, because I'm new, I was promoted to Div9 the other day. I have faced in Div 9 teams with gold players all over the board. Last night, I got beat into oblivion by a BBVA team consisting of 82+ rated Spanish players.
And all he did was cross and head. 
I was down by a healthy margin so I was just passing it around to kill the clock and take my loss. But he continues to just cross and head and cross and head. 
I still enjoy UT, but I get more joy playing against my buddies in the same room. We probably need to try online co-op.
 UT has a lot of jabronis.
Well ultimately one could simply ask them, would you rather live in Africa or the First World? And should they prefer the First world, then they themselves got the good end of the deal for their lineage, the suffering of their ancestors, which I am in no way justifying, benefited them in a way that I, among others, view as a very large reason behind their current quality of life, and possibly success. Slavery is wrong, people having a chance to succeed is good. 
Heres what would happen if the sentry could talk:
Lets call her Deborah (Cause lets face it, cant get more southern than that).
As the engineer leans in for a passionate kiss, Deborah bleeps "*I....I dont know. We've only been together for 5 minutes when your last mini sentry got destroyed by that heavy*" Engineer says "*But...you're different*". As the Engineer passionately leans in, a soldier shoots his beloved Deborah with a rocket. He then proceeds to taunt. Filled with rage, the engineer takes out his short circuit, and kills the soldier. After this event, the engineer spirals into a depression filled with cocaine, cocaine, and more cocaine.
*** Dont taunt after you kill a minisentry or you will turn someone into a coke addict
I would like to address #3 - The Price:
It is a fallacy to say "if your budget is too tight, should you even be spending money on video games?!"  The question is not "what can you afford?" but rather "is there enough value to justify the cost?"  That in fact is the ONLY valid question in assessing value, and there are three primary ways to answer the question...
One is to assess need.  Unless you are so hopelessly addicted to TES, or a professional gamer, this is not valid.  No one NEEDS a video game.
Another is to examine demand, or what someone would pay to buy it from you.  As this is a licensed product, and you are not likely a professional gold farmer, this is moot.
Which brings us to comparative value, or how does it compare in cost/benefit to other similar products.  As far as MMORPGs go, it doesn't seem so crazy; although there are more competitively prices products out there (GW2), this is a premium product and in-line with other premium products.  When you compare to other video games, it's not even a fair comparison:
My favorite video game cost $60 new with about another $30 of DLC new as well.  I have played 1500 hours over the past three years, for a total cost of $0.06 per hour I was entertained.  
Compare this to ESO (or other premium MMORGs).  If I try to squeeze every drop of value out of this game, and make it a half-time job, I'll play 3000 hours over the course of three years (2000 hrs/yr = full time employment, for scale).  At $60 for the game and $15/mo x 36 months for 3000 hours of entertainment, is a cost per hour of $0.20 hour -- but that's if I significantly change my life to accommodate this entertainment product!  If I continue my current gaming habits it costs me $0.40!
So, compared to regular video games, ESO (and other premium MMOPRGs) cost nearly 7 TIMES AS MUCH.  Do they offer you 7 TIMES the value?  Would you be willing to spend $200 for your favorite video game?  If you said yes, you would have 3 different video game experiences over the next 3 years, and still spend the same as you would playing just ESO over that time!
**** At nearly 7 times the cost of the previous TES game, the ESO represents poor value compared to non-MMORPGs.  Also, cost should be evaluated using value, not spending capacity.
EDIT: You can downvote me all you want.  I'm right until you prove me wrong.
"For those who are not too deep into immersion and regard only MMO aspect of the game, I think they will enjoy a lot."
This is completely bullshit, srsly I am sry for talking like this but this is absolutely false. I am RLY deep in immersion and I hate some the mmo aspects of the game but is still enjoy the game rly hard, maybe just because I didn't expect from the game a "skyrim online" or smth similar. Or just because I don't take points that diss appoint me (but are still improve able ) so harsh that I am absolutely against it and won't play it.
i like the game, I like immersion I am a huge TES fan, ur argument is invalid.
Well...the current WoW default UI has changed a lot since vanilla.  It incorporates much of what has been added through add-ons over the years.  Regardless, add-ons are important, because they allow people to customize their UI.  

Want a minimal UI with as little on it as possible, fine.  Want a UI covered in tons of data, hotbars, and information, fine.  It allows the player to choose what they want.  That's what we mean by customization.

ESO's UI is clearly designed with consoles in mind.  That's not inherently bad, but it's different than what MMO players have been used to, and results in loss of functionality and customization.  There has been a trend in MMO's towards more simplicity: fewer skills, fewer damage types, generally players worrying about less.

PC players feel this takes away from their ability to customize - both their character and the UI (it does), and that it is a watering down of the genre to make it more accessible to a larger audience (it is).  By definition, if you have fewer choices, it is simpler.

The UI in ESO is a subjective thing, people coming from the consoles and ES side of the equation are fine with it.  People who are predominately PC gamers with lots of MMO experience are used to, and want, more customization and information.  At a bare minimum, how about a combat log or even a trade channel for chat.

One of the major types of MMO player is very min/max oriented.  The current default ESO UI does nothing for this type of person.  Those are your endgame PvE people.  However, ESO isn't catering those players anyway, so, I figure it's no great loss on their end (I'm one of them).

  Overall, the ESO UI is functional at best, but very mediocre overall.  You can use it, but it's very limited in terms of customization and information that many MMO players want.
I don't think you understand what a "stress test" is. They are trying their hardest to make things go wrong. That way they can find and fix the problems that will arise when millions of people log on when the game goes live before they release the final product. This is not a content or comparability test, its specific purpose is to test the servers.
Also, pertaining "evidence", if you really need reassurance that Bethesda isn't determined to release a quality product after carefully hand-picking people to create a game worthy of the elder scrolls title, you really aren't going to be happy with any "evidence" anyone provides.
TLDR- Stress test, not a content or compatibility test. Have some faith in Bethesda and Zenimax.
I found it very nice actually.
Not this beta, but the one previous to that i was just running around in Daggerfall passively reading the zone chat while crafting. They had a interesting discussion there so i started talking and after a while i realized that everyone who playes Elder Scrolls Online are alot more down to earth and chill, which i'm not very used to after playing WoW and everyone's just grinding and using caps.
I went to sleep, wake up and logged in again. My friends were also back in the chat, we partied up, we joined a guild together. It was a wonderful time, but i only had time to play a couple of hours this beta because i have too much homework :/
Miss those guys
If you just passively read it, of course it's boring. Discuss some lore, talk about interesting class and skill combinations, have fun and meet new people and you will guaranteed find it much more fun. 
I used to rock a pair of Vash's sunglasses from Tri-Gun (got loads of compliments on them, mainly from people who don't know what that is). Well, apparently one of the TSAa knew what it was, and when I was emptying my pockets and pulling loose bills out, he noticed.
Which prompted him to ask me: "Are those double-dollars you're taking out of your pockets?", with a stern (albeit didn't realize he was joking with me) voice.
Since I was going through security and wasn't used to them *ever* being lighthearted like that, I got super anxious and thought he was accusing me of some kind of currency crime or something.
He let me stammer around a bit and boil some anxiety up before letting me know it was a joke, and reminded me that double-dollars are the currency from Tri-Gun (which I had totally not even thought to address in that context).
the TSA workers can be like that too sometimes, just not repetitively like this person, who was obviously trying to get a rise out of them.
“Ha. Your figure transcends the mere concept of pants. Pants cannot contain the raw, primal essence which is *you*. You are as far beyond pants as mankind is beyond fig leaves. My mere human intellect cannot even begin to comprehend the fact that you are wearing pants, much less pass judgement upon such a awesome spectacle.” 
 Yes. You look fat in those pants.
To be fair this is nice and all but its not good for business, it can outweigh the pros of lower labour turnover and the higher motivation for straight overheards.
It can spell the end of businesses to use this practice.
The trouble also is that if it ever couldn't happen then it can destroy motivation and expectations of the staff to a point that its more detrimental than the benefits it was giving.
- This is great and all but it can destroy a business.
To be fair, that is a fate that each of our schools chose by leaving the WCHA and CCHA. 
The pairwise uses schedule strength, and the strength of schedule for opponents in rankings, it isn't a subjective judgement like the polls are. Western Michigan has the same conference record as Vermont, but Vermont has played many more ranked opponents going 6-11-2 against ranked, while Western has gone 3-5-2 against ranked opponents. The NCHC has been awful for the most part outside of the conference, and that is a big reason why only 3 teams are ranked. NCHC teams need to play better to be ranked higher. 
**Edit:** To further support that the NCHC needs to step up non-conference play to be more relevant (crunching numbers from USCHO), as a conference (meaning all teams in the conference), the NCHC has had about a 53% winning percentage outside of their conference, while Hockey East has had a 66% winning percentage outside of theirs. To put this in perspective, the Big Ten has a 60% winning percentage outside of their conference.
To be fair as well, most other conferences play a lot more outside of their conference than the NCHC has this season. 
**** The NCHC as a conference wins only about half the games they play outside of their conference. Majority of games in conference + bad winning percentages outside of conference = low amount of ranked NCHC teams.
So if I wasn't clear what I meant is they already have the ability to do something like what you are suggesting.  If 10 users are within 40m of a certain portal within a 1min time period and 9 of the 10 see x/y/z wifi signals, a/b/c satellites, connect with cell towers d/e/f, and so on, and the 10th user's scanner reports it is also within 40m but doesn't see any wifi (or sees the wrong wifi), doesn't report the correct satellites, etc, his cheat score is looking pretty high.  
niantic already has an encrypted client protobuf for comparing ancillary data to expose cheaters
UHC (Ultra Hardcore) is an unofficial gametype in Minecraft in which people are scattered throughout a limited world and must kill each other. The twist is that you can't regenerate health without golden apples or potions. This was invented and made famous by the Mindcrack group of Let's Players, who make an occasional 'season' of videos of this. This tends to get hyped to the max (More than MCat 016).
 A thing in Minecraft.
Seriously!  
When I started doge I was doing BTC faucets to get a feel for converting to doge and the transaction times where surprisingly long to me compared to doge! 
TLDR dogecoin travels at light speed= proof of moon landing 
Honestly, some of those trail maintainers are just pussies. Where I ride (in the mud) when it dries up, the track is gnarly for about a month (awesome gnarly, everybody loves it). Then those self proclaimed masters of trails come ruining it by flattening everything to the point that I honestly think I could ride down the trial on my roadbike because fuck everybody. 
Once a tree fell over the track, so naturally we moved some dirt in front of it so we would have a kickass jump. 2 months later those idiots came in with a saw and ruined it because the track wasn't supposed to be that way. Imagine a track changing in time due to nature oh my.
 Honestly, if you see a nicely crafted trail that is truly maintained by a kind group of people, don't ride it in the mud, but those are very rare in Europe. America is not the world. For the other trails: just have fun
See I was a skeptic too until people kept complaining about bitcoin wealth inequality.  Capitalists create value and society pays them for it, there is nothing wrong with that.
When you see a 20 year-old become a bitcoin millionaire, its easy to point to it and say it's odd or it's unfair.  But bitcoin didn't create the economy it is disrupting.
See the real wealth inequality is in the traditional economy, bitcoin millionaires are just a side effect of THAT screwed up economic system.
It's something easy to see and point too, but what we can't see is how similar inequalities are fostered by the system everyday from the top down.
Bitcoin is a tiny peek into that world

tl:dr. There is nothing unsettling about people making money off of bitcoin
Not anti calipari as much as "this guy isnt talking up my program"
It happens across reddit. I get downvoted by Florida fans constantly because im not a homer and ill post something that I think our own fans should realize before going off on tangents of how great we are. And most redditors are so unhealthily obsessed with karma that instead of hitting "Reply" and trying to prove a point with words they just downvote me. i dont care getting downvoted, i laugh at it. its funny. bitches on here show their tits for karma for fuck sakes. I enjoy when I see my messages box filled with 8...9...10 replies because im hoping that someone actually said something that educates me for later usage (its happened a few times in here too, thankfully.) I know I have a tendency to say shit thats exaggerated (im bipolar and impulsive plus i have a temper so sometimes i forget to read what i say before hitting save) but i also tend to not bite my words because the average sports fan is incredibly stupid.
that may have had nothing to do with your post but i just woke up from a epic nap and felt like ranting.
 people of reddit arent good at arguing, people of reddit aren't good at accepting the reality that their program isnt the holy grail of sports and people of reddit just generally aren't very smart in regards to sports. 
&gt;That blows. My friend went through a similar predicament except the girl was actually pregnant. For months she tormented him and then the baby was born... And there was no way it could have been his but she had everyone on her side.
&gt;He says fuck this and leaves to start a new life. Kid looked nothing like him and he was fairly confident that the math didn't add up right anyways. Still he was harassed, emotionally tormented, and couldn't Even come to his hometown to visit family and friends without her finding out. It didn't stop until he finally met the girl's parents who had never even seen a picture of him and so were on their daughter's side this whole time. The meeting changed everything because the parents realized that their daughter was an idiot and some sort of crazy. Still that was three years of fear, depression and a close shave with suicide that I was fortunate enough to talk him out of.
&gt;sorry that happened, people be cray cray.
&gt;Edit: apparently I should've mentioned that the baby ended up being a different ethnicity. To elaborate on this I'll also add that so many people were on her side because the relationship between my friend and her was brief and none of her friends and family ever met the guy. That's why the meeting with the parents had such an impact.
Same schtick as the Quran predicting science. Some words can be interpreted to kinda sorta mean some sciencey stuff. 
There's a few things that go into this. First, the fact that advanced science like quantum mechanics is often 'dumbed down' to layman's terms, so that more people can understand it and why it's important. The simplified versions are much more easily compared to the abstract writing of religious texts.
The second is that Religion has had a big effect on language. Many of the words we commonly use are due to them being translated or interpreted into English (or w/e language). This causes the words of the religion to be used more frequently (light, power, angels, flaming, etc.).
People use simple language to describe abstract and rather unrelated concepts, and people spazz over how common words look similar to themselves.
Lots of downvotes throughout the thread. I don't know how I feel about this, either. On one hand it seems fair to say in the short term of what's been concluded in research is that nicotine vapor dispensers are safer to the second-hand user over cigarettes. I go to a bar in LA where smoking is allowed, and let me tell you, it can get obnoxious. It's actually quite fine when a couple of people are smoking in the room, it's when someone lights up a fat cigar and intentionally stinks up the room that ruins the entire place.
This is kind of how I feel about vaporizers now... people really find an excuse to use them wherever and really like doing the things those cigar users do... big long drags with huge smoke clouds in smaller spaces, talking endlessly about the flavor they got, how much they dropped on their machine, challenging other users to cloud contests-- you see what I'm doing here. I'm being prejudice. I'm singling out a single type of user who doesn't represent the majority of users as a whole.
But I've about all I can take. These people litter the pathways on campus, intentionally blowing smoke as you pass by, or smoking way too close to where people are eating, working, studying. Tell them to take it elsewhere or that it's bothering you, it's the same diatribe that's in this thread: "But it's safe for you and I!" or "It's a free country! I can smoke this here!".
I guess my argument is heavily flawed. People will munch food loudly next to you, will rev motorcycle engines next to you at a stop light, will talk on a cell phone in an otherwise quiet environment, will endlessly show off their children to you... I wish instead of an outright ban, we could have made it optional. We have no food/drink signs, noise violations, silence courtesies, and just general telling people you've had enough of whatever in place to regulate most things. I really just dislike this culture vaping has brought on real quickly.
And I'm ranting to no one. Probably no one here is one of those people. But you've seen them. You've had smoke blown your way from them. They've filled your neighborhood bar with kiwi melon aroma while blabbing on about how "yeah, this vial here actually has *more* nicotine than normal!". I would have much rather had an opt-in that could let bars say no smoking of any kind, or pathways that designated smoking areas away from most people. An outright ban seems on step too far-- but a unanimous vote to ban was certainly asinine.
*** I can sympathize with the intentions of the ban, but it took it too far. We still have the right to do much more annoying things than puffing smoke into people's faces.
Hey Voltronnn,
I keep a very good eye on our Facebook page and reddit page as one of the Marketing guys here. I've referred your case over to our CS department and followed up with them throughout the day.
First off, I'd like to apologize for the delay on the refund. 3-5 days is our typical refund turnaround time, but with the added crunch of order processing it seemed to get pushed back a business day to 6. While this isn't acceptable, it is the truth. So I've had our CS Manager walk over to our accounting department and watch our accountant process the refund in front of him.
I can say with confidence that your refund is complete on our end and it's now the responsibility of your bank/CC to process the funds. 
On the subject of the factory delays, there is very little we can do about unexpected manufacturing defects other than fix them and wait. We always try our hardest to have the best availability that we possibly can, but in the case of the matte black H440 we were hit with much higher demand than supply. 
With that said, we aren't in the business of stringing people along. We completely understand your frustration, just as we would probably be frustrated ourselves. 
While I'm not part of the Customer Service team, I am part of the NZXT team and can say that we are all enthusiasts, gamers, and consumers. We're trying as hard as we can with the staff that we have to get this worked out and are in the process of hiring more people so this kind of this doesn't happen down the road. And again, I'm really sorry about your experience with our CS team and store.
-Mitch
**NZXT.**
Had our CS Mgr walk to Accounting to watch your refund get processed.
**Wheels:**
Not a lot to comment on here. There's enough brands out there that if I started listing them off, I probably won't be done writing this comment by the time a new wrangler model comes out. Just know that a JK has a 5x5 hub pattern. Common backspacing is roughly 4.5in which will clear most/all tires up to 37in. Once you hit 37+ you need a maximum of 4.5in backspacing with the less the better. It depends on the brand and tire size but 37s are usually when steering rub starts coming into play. I personally never recommend wheel spacers as they are just another part of the system you're adding on that can potentially fail.
* Wheel Sizes:
    * **MOST 15" RIM STEEL WHEELS WILL NOT FIT A JK**
        * While your wallet wants you to get R15 wheels as it is usually the cheapest, only certain R15 wheels will fit. Check on forums to see which brands will fit. Most steel wheels will fit after some minor grinding on the brake calipers.
    * 16" Rim size
        * If you only ever plan to go up to a 35in tire these are probably ideal for you. You do not need to worry about fitting as virtually all 16" rim size wheels will fit a JK. Most companies only offer up to 35in diameter tires on this rim size so if you plan to go larger buy accordingly.
    * 17" Rim size
        * A bit more pricy than 16's but you'll find that majority of brands make tire sizes that fit this rim ranging up and beyond 37in diameter tires.
    * 18"+ Rim size
        * Purely for show. There is no real advantage to a wheel this big. If you really like the look, expect to pay substantially higher prices for tires.

**Gearing:**
So you've read numbers on forums... 4.11... 5.13... 4.56...3.73... and you ask yourself, what the hell is this jibberish? These are axle differential gear ratios. Feel free to google that if you want to know a more technical side of it, but for now all you need to know is that to keep power and not overtax your engine, you need matching gear ratios to your tire size.  Opinions will vary on which ratios are better than others, so there isn't set advice for any specific one.
If you own an 07-2011 JK/U You probably know by now that you have a 3.8L V6 engine.
[This chart will help you decide what gearing is best for you](
If you own a 2012-current model year JK/U you probably know by now that you have a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine.
[This chart will help you decide what gearing is best for you](
****
**Additional General Info:**
So you want your JK/U to be a mean offroadin' machine eh? Join the club! Most of us do; but remember, don't buy something on the sole basis that it looks cool (unless you're a mall crawler). While brands like Smittybilt may draw you in with their cheap pricing and good lookin' equipment, they under-perform, have terrible tolerancing, and often break long before a higher end product will. JK forums are filled with picture threads so start googling. You'll quickly find that there are an assortment of All American brands that produce high quality equipment from lift systems to armor. Sites like Quadratec and 4WheelParts are good for sourcing what type of products you might like, but do your homework before purchasing. IF you find something in particular from these sites check on other websites like Amazon as they usually offer better deals. I've found that Northridge4x4 offers a great variety of smaller american made brands that you won't see on larger chain retailers.

 Read the whole comment. Seriously. Its helpful. Don't just skip to this.
If you have ANY questions feel free to PM me any time. I'm always happy to help a fellow jeeper!
I use the Strong Lifts 5x5 app.  It tracks the major lifts that are part of the SL program (Squats, Bench, Rows, OHP, Deadlift) as well as body weight.  I like it for a few reasons:
* For each lift there are X number of circle icons where X is the number of sets you need to complete for that lift (5 for SQ,BP,Row,OHP and 1 for Deads) and each time you tap the circle, the number changes (from 5 to 0) indicating the number of reps you completed in that set.  
* If you complete 5x5 on a specific exercise, it's all like CONGRATS DUDE, +5 LBs NEXT TIME!   Then, when you're back in the gym, doing that same A or B workout again, it automatically increases the weight for you, so no going to back to previous days and 'mathin things.  **Bonus*** - In the settings for the app, you can change the increments to whatever custom weight you prefer.
* It has a timer.  When you mark a set as done, the timer resets.  This single thing has been amazing for me.  I learned that without it, I am very impatient and tend to think I'm ready for my next set after 60-70 seconds.  This feature has helped me wait longer (2-3 mins) until my next set.  
***  Stronglifts 5x5 app.  Is created specifically for SL, has a great UI, automatically increases work weight if you complete an exercise for the full 5x5, and has a timer so you can monitor time between sets.
But the buyout at this point only saves us $2m, so it might not even be worth it. Not from a fan standpoint, but from a player standpoint. Wilson did a lot when he vouched for Torres and took the fine this summer and kept Kearns around. There's a trade off point where a buyout is worth the roster spot vs. the good will you build with the rest of your team and potential targets when you say, "Hey... we realize you've had a rough go, and you have a huge contract that we could save some money on, but we stand by the guys in our locker room and we're going to stick out the deal we made."      
$2m isn't really *that* much and if eating that contract makes San Jose a more attractive option for other players in the league, the benefit outweighs the cost of just letting him play out his last year.
That's true, I did see that in the article. However,
&gt; In brief, then, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that, given at least some wind on Earth, there must at all times be a

It's really the version, without going into the layers of atmosphere.
So memorabilia of the death of Japanese teenagers due to the failure of the government "does not promote international peace," but Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, and Burmese do. Take your racism, bigotry, and political agenda elsewhere. 
"Japan" isn't meant to be portrayed as a victim, and neither is "Imperial Japan." The prevailing wisdom is that young men were sent to their deaths against their will under the authority of an overzealous government who didn't have a chance at victory to begin with. Kamikaze bombings do not "glorify" imperialism; five seconds on google will reveal that it was a last-resort strategy to protect the nation from complete takeover--a move of absolute desperation. Japan isn't proud of sending all of its young men to die. Study Reconstruction and how the Seijin-shiki (Adulthood Ceremony) came to be. Start there, and it should become painfully obvious. (Also, the museum explains the extensive brainwashing that went on in the military, something that any modern militarized state wouldn't dare to allow). 
As a China/Korea propagandist, you of all people should understand the true consequences of warfare: Human lives. It doesn't matter if you're Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American, or *any* ethnicity. Death and casualties--inherently *inseparable* from warfare--are a tragedy, no matter your nationality. Some members of the Imperial Japanese army committed horrible atrocities--but that doesn't make present-day *Japan* a nation of barbarians and swine, and it doesn't mean that the uninvolved majority or victims of such acts don't deserve to be remembered, either. **Loss of human lives is a tragedy that transcends national borders.** It's been over half a century, and it's a shame that people still don't seem to understand this. 
**The message to take away here, from such artifacts, is one of Anti-*war*, but somehow people find the cleverest ways to make it "Anti-Japan."** The addition of the diary *would* promote peace, as it inherently opposes such desperate measures as suicide bombings, as it is anti-war in nature. 
I get it. Korea and China want to paint a picture of Kamikaze pilots being batshit insane nationalists, and that the entire country is currently full of crazies. It's against their interests to acknowledge that these were real *people,* because this is contrary to their current "Demonize Japan" campaign. **Picking and choosing parts of history may fulfill some sort of political agenda, but it is not academically virtuous nor beneficial for the future of humanity.**

__________________________________________________________
**** The addition of the diary would, in fact, promote peace as it is inherently an anti-war artifact. Unless, of course, you believe that no Japanese soldier deserves to be remembered as a person, or a casualty of war.  
Enemy Within changes enough of the game that I'd honestly recommend trying a classic non-ironman run to get a feel for the changes before doing C/I.
Concerning meld: don't get it if you can't do it safely.  Also, you get credit for open meld canisters when you finish a level.  You have to build a facility to use either gene mods or MECs, so it's likely that you'll have enough by the time you can use it.  Some gene mods are super handy, such as Mimetic Skin and Second Heart, and MECs are pretty powerful/useful in any squad.  
 only get meld if you can do so safely, don't rush for it, researching meld gets you 40 or so meld, it's pretty damn useful.

Mental issues? So a third of the country has mental issues?
You realize there a plenty of regular ol' overweight people who just never learned proper portion control, right? It's a country wide cultural problem 30+ years in the making. Increase in poverty, the rise of dual-income households and takeout, increase in indoor entertainment, decrease in PE funding, increase in restaurant portions and free refills, emphasis on sweets/processed food for a few generations of children.
A 400 lb person probably has some serious personal issues to worth on, yes. But a 200 lb person? There are plenty of happy-go-lucky overweight people who simply need to make better dietary choices and improve their eating habits.
Not at all fat people live in shame and hate themselves. Some of them just really like tacos.
No problem man, my uncle was a Marine sniper, though I didn't want anything to do with guns for a long time until I had an incident with a home invader.  Before purchasing my first firearm I decided to do it right and go at the situation like I would with computers or anything else and learn everything I could about how they work and how to use them properly before feeling comfortable around them at all.
 People are going to give you crap for not knowing how these things work, but really that's to be expected.  Video games, even some of the best simulator geared ones like ARMA and the SWAT series, don't give a representation of how any of these things work.  Honestly the SWAT series is amongst the best at this, but the problem is that simulating how a gun shoots is going to be one of the hardest things to do in a game because of all of the physics simulation required to run it along with all of the other stuff that makes the game work, and we're only at a point now where we are delighted to see objects fall and liquid move around kind like it should.
I'm going to assume the reason why you thought high caliber rifle rounds did so much damage was because sniper rifles in video games usually do so much damage no?  I might be way off base, but assuming that's where you got the idea the reason why sniper rifles work that way in games has everything to do with it being a game and not a simulation.  They do so much damage to reward the player for picking a class or a weapon that has a slow rate of fire.  It's a simple as that.  Game balance takes paramount over realism so the game will be fun, and even in series that used to do simulation if they've lasted until now you'll notice that they slip further away from that to gain a wider audience because the closer you get to realism the further away from fun you get for most people, especially in mulitplayer.  
The only reason why SWAT and ARMA get away with what they do is because the objective of those games is tied into the situation they are attempting ti simulate where the goal isn't to kill the other team but to accomplish a set of objectives.  In SWAT's case the goal is to arrest the suspects, preferably alive as the game punishes you for any and all causalities during a mission, so the realism adds to the difficulty.  In ARMA's scenarios are supposed to be objective based where patrols and such happen like on the field, which may or may not involve combat at all.
In a game like recent Rainbow Six titles, Call of Duty, or Battlefield which are focused on team deathmatch style multiplayer realistic ballistics hamper gameplay.  Rainbow Six used to try and do things realisticly, but what they found after Raven Shield on the PC is that getting shot through a door or a wall without knowing what happened is just frustrating for most of the market.  People want to stay in the fight longer so they take away realistic damage, and most of all no one wanted to be completely outgunned by one guy with an M1911 taking down droves of people running around with assault rifles.  This would happen in Raven Shield because the game allowed you to kit up with several types of body armor or none at all and most people picked none to move faster and picked an assault rifle they were familiar with and expected to run around and shoot accurately like in a normal game.  The game attempted to simulate how inaccurate people actually are when moving around in high stress situations so they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, and when they did it would hit limbs which wouldn't put down people.  
In real life an M1911 which uses.45 caliber rounds selected with hollow points has a larger potential lethal target on someone in real life because the bullet balloons and moves slowly through the body doing tons of damage, so you could easily kill someone by hitting them anywhere in the upper torso unlike with a bullet from an M16 which if it hit the lungs it would probably go straight through and if a medic came fast enough they'd be able to patch the lung and the victim would live.  
The game reflected this so you could easily solo a whole team yourself by sitting in a corner crouched with the pistol and calmly put down the whole lot of them with little effort since most people weren't aware that the game was going for ultra realism.  Which of course frustrated most gamers leaving the game to be a very niche product and ever since none of the games work like this.  And since this is the only place most people come into contact with anything close to a firearm people tend to think that shotguns spray bullets in a wide arch right out of the barrel or that sniper rifles can kill someone if you hit them nearly anywhere and that walls actually protect people from bullets, or that its even remotely realistic for people to be as accurate as they are in games like they would be in real life in a threatening close quarters situation.   

TL:DR: Guns in video games are nothing like in real life, like at all. It's just virtual laser tag with military window dressing. But it's ok not to know that, don't let other people get you down, with any luck you'll never have to know anything about the real thing outside of the safety of a gun range anyway.
 
While not directly related, I'm usually troubled by the way Ray is treated, and the way homosexuality is treated, in general. Every gay character so far is either inept and verbally abused by those around him (Ray), mentally ill (Lucas Troy) or quasi-sociopathic (Ramon and the the other two Cuban gay hit men). I mean, shit, Woodhouse is only gay for Reggie and even he's abused verbally as if its OK.
As for the masculinity and how it's portrayed, the women aren't treated well either. Lana is, without question, the most competent agent but even she needs to be saved by Archer all the damn time. Pam is completely out of control, dick hungry and obsessive-compulsive. and Cheryl is...you know what she is. 
I think all of this is done for comedic effect, and done well (I mean, I love the show) but I do get irked from time to time.
- I criticized the show based on my observations, which I believe to be fair. Since I wasn't like "OMGTHISISTHEBESTSHOWEVERWITHNOPROBLEMS!!!" You're all going to downvote it, so have at it.
&gt; And to be fair, it's not always a witch-hunt. There are plenty of buildings that have come down due to genuine negligence.
That's a fair assessment. But to make a blanket statement that if the rules weren't strict enough, not everyone did their job is completely idiotic.
You can't account for everything, and even if you tried, you can only do so within a reasonable limit based on available resources.
don't be an idiotic armchair engineer on the internetz
Bro, I envy you. 

I only started to follow the light to the iron temple last year at the age of 25.  By the time you are my age if you stick to it you will be one ripped motherfucker. 

Try not to feel bad for yourself and stop with all the excuses you listed above. One thing I have learnt is that noone gives a shit about the person who gave up when things got hard, The only way you are going to get anywhere is to stop your bitching and fight your way through it. 

- GO eat a burger and lift something heavy 
I'll say why I think you are being downvoted. This'll be blunt. Just trying to help! Sorry in advance.
1. Don't make posts like [this]( and [this]( Everyone who has proper critical thinking skills knows Jesus existed. No one is downvoting you for being wrong, they are downvoting you for being ignorant to this. Also, no one is teaching this in secular schools lest they be fired on the spot when a christian student goes home to tell their mom this funny thing their teacher said.
2. [Why did you even post this?]( And why did you reply to a commenter, "*Ramen? pretty yummy*"?
3. [And this one.]( That's not a clever line, that's just a bad post that you made. Especially so because you posted it on /r/atheism. (???)
4. [I'm starting to see a trend...](
Ok, case closed. As I combed a few of your recent posts, I now see that you just go to principle-based subreddits and post converse and sometimes incoherent submissions, then follow up these self-posts with plenty of comments for people to downvote. 
**** You aren't hated on reddit, you just need to stop being so hostile.
[You say that like it's a good thing.](  
edit: A few relevant parts from the amazing article:  
&gt;Sutter Health, California Pacific Medical Center’s parent company, operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California, almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center, the state’s largest private nonprofit hospital, also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country, according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.  
... 

&gt;“Sutter is a leader — a pioneer — in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competition,” said Glenn Melnick, a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. “How do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue, and they raise prices as much as they can — all the research supports that.”  
...  

&gt; California Pacific Medical Center’s 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32,901 for an X-ray study of the heart’s arteries to $25,646.88 for gall bladder removal (doctor’s fees not included) to $5,510 for a simple vaginal delivery (not including $731 for each hour of labor, or $137 for each bag of IV fluid). Even basic supplies or services carry huge markups: $20 for a codeine pill (50 cents at Rite-Aid or Walgreens), $543 for a breast-pump kit ($25 online), $4,495 for a CT scan of the abdomen (about $400 at an outpatient facility nearby). Plenty of other hospitals set similar prices.  
...  
&gt; “Hospitals are self-fueling, ever-expanding machines,” said James Robinson, an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “There is an infinite amount of stuff to buy — amenities, machines, new wings, higher salaries, more nurses.”  

...  
&gt; “Hospitals see where they’re making money and try to do more of that,” said Dr. David Gifford, a former health commissioner of Rhode Island, who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable, though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test — ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room — are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical Center’s chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.  

...   
&gt; Though hospitals’ nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits, California Pacific Medical Center’s main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients, lower than the state average of 2.07 percent, according to statistics compiled by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The far smaller St. Luke’s branch spent 5.32 percent that year.  
*** Non-profit hospitals are up the same shit that for-profit hosptials are up to, but they do it under the guise of being "non-profit," which to the average citizens seems to mean "altruistic."
You can't save someone from themselves.
God, I wish I could just fucking scream this at people. You say you're not naive, but you're honestly coming here asking for the one answer we're going to give you: Cut him loose.
There's no magic fucking bullet! Sweet Christ, you people who come in here, thinking, nay, hoping that we're going to have some goddamned emotional salve for you! 
He's a heroin addict. I've had my own opiate problem, and I'm not the only one who will shout from the rooftops the very first line of this post.
**You can't save someone from themselves.**
Period. You can't talk them out of it, you can't wish them out of it, and you sure as hell won't pray them out of it. The only thing that will get him clean is him. Not you. Not you telling him you'll leave if he doesn't. He must do this *for himself*. Maybe your leaving is the best thing for him; the shot across the bow that says he can't live like this anymore, but goddamnit, take these words to the bank and cash this reality check:
You read like someone who is a "fixer". You think you can "fix" him, because he's broken, but he's not a toy. He isn't a clock. He's not fucking "broken", he's just sick. Unfortunately, in a situation which violates all of our common sense, he has to be not only his own diagnostician, but his own doctor. Unlike cancer or typhus, no one else can prescribe the right course of action but him.
**You can't save someone from themselves.**
I know this might come across aggressive and downright angry, and that's because I sincerely am. I'm angry that there's still a contingency of people who view addicts as simply broken people, when they're markedly ill. 
** Tell him you're leaving, and tell him why: Because you can't save someone from themselves. Get your heart patched up with some whiskey, time, and space, and move on.**
EDIT: Also, I'm in complete agreement with /u/UglyPete. This relationship's biggest problem is not heroin. Heroin is just the stand-in actor. The red herring, if you will.
I think most of the complaints in this thread boil down to the shortfalls of alerts. Lets face it, its a shit system to keep us interested while they spend years making us real content.
The alerts encourage conquest, as quick as possible, not good fights. The way TR usually goes about winning alerts is conducive to winning alerts, not creating fun fights. But we like to win, you can't blame us for that.
 It's SOES FAULT, NERF HIGBY
I do LP for a grocery store in my area. After my two days of training (yes that's all I got) I got put on a store all by myself. On my second night of training my trainer and I got a call from our boss: A serial shoplifter know for getting away with 1000's of dollars of merch hit a nearby store. Red alert. We each stood by the front and exit doors respectively watching for this guy. No dice.
The next day was my first day by myself: Fresh out of the box, green as can be, pick your euphemism. Within half an hour of my shift, a man matching the description we received comes in. He grabs a basket and head down one of the toiletry aisles. I think he's going for the baby formula again so I stand by that. Next thing I know he walks towards the entrance door (his main means of escape). But he doesn't walk right out, he lingers. This gives me enough time to run to the exit. By this time he's on his way to his getaway car with his partner in it. I get right behind him (not allowed to touch him) yelling "STOP". He gets in the car and drives off. I nab the license plate number.
The police show up and we (store managers and I) hand over the suspect description, video from cameras and plate number to the police. A few days later, I read in the local paper that the guy was arrested along with his brother/co-conspirator and charged with the crime. He ended up stealing $1600 worth of teeth whitening strips that day.
Fin.
 I was able to get info to help get a serial felony shoplifter arrested.
Ahahahha something similar happened to a person I know.
He was working in a call center for the biggest ISP in my country when he got the call from a customer without internet connection.
After going through the usual troubleshooting, she causally mentioned that she couldn't keep talking because the fire was getting close and the firemen were trying to get her out of the house.
tl;dr
Customer tries to get her connection back while getting flambéd.
Interestingly, a major aspect of Darwin's Theory of Evolution is being challenged in Biology. The idea that genes are the only information holder that can spur on natural selection has been specifically contested.
Epigenetics is part of how your body regulates what genes to read and transcribe (make). Different enzymes add or subtract chemical groups to your genes to allow/prevent them to be read. These chemical marks have been proven to change throughout an individual's life span and can be induced through environmental factors (pollution, nutrient availability, etc.)
There are a few key experiments involving that acquire different chemical groups on their genes throughout their lifespan that then pass on those marks to their offspring. I'm on mobile right now so I can't post links to some of these experiments. However if you're interested try searching these: 
Agouti mouse experiment
Dutch hunger study
Pottenger's cats
I'm not saying epigenetics truly proves Darwin wrong (again this is a really contested idea in Biology). But it's a really interesting and debated topic about one of science's greatest theories. 
Evolution true, but aspects are contested. Epigenetics may help in natural selection.
 
EDIT: Just for re-clarification, Natural Selection, method by which a species as a whole evolves, is the main aspect Epigenetics is challenging.
Hey, at least you don't read astronomy "news" on major news sites. The asteroid from a few days ago that passed earth closer than the average orbital distance of the moon was said to have a 1 in 10 million chance of hitting earth, as of a day or two before closest approach.
Intrigued by the apparently insane uncertainty for a body of that size, I looked into JPL's data and there actually *was* a 1 in 10 million chance of the asteroid impacting the earth. In 2046. But by the time the article got published that was already a non-possibility, latest projections put CA at .42 billion km.
And don't get me started on all the misinformation regarding ultracaps...

 Science journalists for mainstream news networks should be shot. 
The main issue with your argument is that evolution isn't an explanation that says things change in this way. It's a huge field of scientific thought that seeks to map out the physical relationships of things that are (and things that were).  If we assume some sort of accurate trace of evolution back to a theoretic genesis by creator, you still have animals that show genetic markers of previous generations...
That is to say, evolution does not at all point to things starting from something complex, and many of the markers and characteristics we see in living things blow the theoretic genesis creation timeline entirely out of the water.
You could say that you think that evolution suddenly started for no reason (other than the creator explanation) as though it had been going for a while - that a creator effectively faked a giant history that's not there.  But if you're going to say that the modern scientific field of evolution and it's partner process of slow change through natural selection fits seamlessly with biblical literalism, you're going to be wrong.
 you could argue that natural selection (the process by which evolution occurs) fits with biblical literalism, but not that evolution does.

Have to stick up for Vice a bit. Last summer in Romania there were big street protests against Rosia Montana project. In short, an ex heroin dealer and a couple of wall street "investors"  set up a fake company(named "the Gold corporation", seriously)and wanted to start a huge mining project. Problem was ,they were going to pay only 6% on gold only(most experts stated that other more valuable materials were to be extracted), demolish entire archeological sites and towns, and use incredibly shoddy enviromental standards that would see an artificial lake filled with cyanide waste, while the fake corporation would disband and make off with the money. The most disgusting thing was how most of the media was silent about this with some cronies praising this fucking disaster like it was the second coming of Christ. Later it emerged that a lot of media cunts were on payola. Things got critical when a new prime-minister came to power and,hilariously,changed his position 180 degrees from vehemently anti to strongly pro. Then the street protests started by people who had had enough of this shit and weren't about to let the entire country be poisoned by cyanide when the lake gave way. The one street protest that I was part of easily had  60-80000 people marching on the main streets,with a lot of students, families with kids,grandmas and other old fucks etc. Honestly it was the most civilized mass gathering i had ever seen. Yet on the news it was presented as 5000 dirty hippies running around causing trouble(they even used archive footage from other countries and presented them as local ) Other international news outlets like cnn or bbc barely mentioned the whole thing with the exception of VICE, who did entire in depth articles on the issue in the US Canada and UK versions. In short,yeah thay are snotty hipsters but they still have a bit of that desire to create good shit. Speaking of which, i really have to take one.
Some of it is sort of the 'death of Austin' stuff though. The business started to suffer on Guad because of how that part of Guadalupe is changing, forcing the move. 

Really though, the could just be "niche business with inexperienced owners suffers, falters during recession."
Both in a sense. Say you have a male and female Fletchling but only the male has Gale Wings (fletchling's HA) the only way to pass it down is by breeding the male with a ditto. Also note that it's still only 60% chance to pass down in this case (not completely certain of that number). If you have a female Fletchling with Gale Wings but not a male I believe your odds drop to 30%. If both male and female have the HA it's 80%. The number may not be entirely accurate but the context is still the same
 Only female has HA=lowest chance. Only male has HA you must breed with ditto=medium chance. Male and female have HA=highest chance
This is a very problematic map. The main thing it shows is a "flow of transnational gang crime and violence." Crime and violence do not "flow." The word 'flow' is a troubling word that has connotations of an 'unstoppable tide,' creates panic, and suggests that any exchange is wholly one-way. The one-way problem is something else this map does as a whole - its artificially narrow scope and language, as well as those leading buzzwords on the side, imply that Mexico is a crime-infested, lawforsaken place, from which corruption and violence is spewing into pristine, otherwise crime-free America. By picking out 'cities reporting mexican drug organisations' (which, surprise surprise, are basically all major cities, therefore the dots tell us very little other than that there are Mexicans in each major city, and that some of those Mexicans are involved in crime. Well... yeah. Same goes for any other significant racial group you care to choose.)
The arrows also appear to be drawn on no evidence whatsoever. They are basically an artist's impression, drawing red lines from Mexico to each of the blue dots. This suggests that 'Mexican' crime in New York has reached New York overland, by surging quietly along all of the rural towns in the Midwest and the East before reaching NYC. I wonder where all of the reports of gangs of Mexican criminals moving in a horde along country roads on their way to New York via Tennessee are?
- this map is at best devoid of any useful factual information, and at worst quasi-xenophobic propaganda.
Very good reason for this, actually, though it isn't 100% obvious.
The 560 is a fully manual flash. In optical slave mode, all it's doing is looking for a relatively bright pulse of light, at which point it will fire off at whatever power you've set on the back. Simple, easy to use, effective.
The commander mode on your D7000 is another beast entirely. It's designed to work by setting off a ton of extremely short, dim pulses of light before the shutter opens and the main flash goes off to communicate TTL information to an off-camera, optically slaved *TTL enabled Nikon flash*. Now, this is great if you *have* a Nikon flash in the right mode, but you don't. You have a simple manual YN560 in optical slave mode.
Now, in the daytime, those TTL communication pulses are probably too dim to set off the YN, so it fires along with the main flash pulse coming off the D7k. At night though, since the ambient light level is so low, the YN is probably seeing the first of the TTL pulses and just firing immediately - *before the shutter is even open*. This is obviously not what you want.
- Take the D7000 off of commander mode, put it in normal flash mode and set the flash power as low as you can put it if you don't want it contributing to the scene. This will solve your problem.
Market research.
Price is essentially just a way to quantify value. You need to know how valuable the event and thus the photographs are for the client. This will vary from individual to individual.
You could look at competitors for guidelines regarding pricing, but if it's event photography that you're doing then competitor pricing will be nothing more than a very rough guideline.
Because, who exactly are you competing with at a specific event? The answer is amateur photographs taken by the participants, which are free.
The more important, and thus valuable, the event is to the participants the higher they will value your photos and the more you can charge. I've not found any actual research into this, but I suspect this will be some percentage of the total amount the guests will spend on/for the event (e.g. dresses, dinner and so forth).
This is supported by my own experience with wedding photography has, selling prom photographs and photographs from sporting events such as marathons. These all feature differing pricing levels, with wedding photography supporting the highest prices, and marathons the lowest. 
What the ACTUAL optimal price-point is, I haven't yet been able to determine, but I have noticed that price for event photographs tend to be quite inelastic with a sharp drop off. I.e. there's quite a wide margin in price in which you will sell X amount, but once you raise the price over a certain level your sales will drop off *dramatically*. Suffice to say, it's higher than you think. Amusement parks who sell photographs at some of their rides tend to have their pricing right at this drop off point, at least when I've looked at local facilities and their pricing.
You may want to get a PhD in economics.
If you do go through with it, I'd try and be anonymous as possible. I'd also look up laws about tips, I don't know how US law compares to Iceland.
listen to David760, Z0di and SaggyNipplez
Well if the cops are taking just about any anonymous tip, you could always tip them off to the massive drug smuggling/grow operation the head cop of that raid is running in his house. I bet he's in the human trafficking business too. Get a couple friends to give similar tips, spaced out by a few days/weeks to avoid attracting attention.

Sorry guys, had to say this in icelandic. that police behaviour like this, especially in Iceland is far from ok. He can file a lawsuit wich is unlikely to backfire if he collects proper evidence.
Last game hit mythic tier in an ongoing Pathfinder game. Shades of grey campaign, and our party was faced with individual decisions on which direction we wished to go. As members of our nation's military,  we had to choose whether we supported an assault that led to the slaughter of innocents, or if we would save the lives of said innocents. All five of us chose to abandon King and Country to save the women and children of our avowed foes. 
In an attempt to force the party to split, we basically assisted in derailing the DM's immediate plans, and we now have next week off so he can revamp the campaign a bit. 
Tl; dr: DM tried to force us to split, we all showed him that we are alike in party/role playing. 
I paid more than that for it, and I think it was worth it. The concept it wants to achieve may not be executed perfectly, but the whole game is so out of the ordinary and innovative that it's still great. It has some nifty investigation mechanics -- it's a bit limited, but you won't notice too much. Compared to the many shooters and fantasy games I usually play, I loved this because it was a breath of fresh air.
 ya cuz its gud
I'm not an evolutionary biologist so if I'm wrong about anything then I hope someone corrects me, but I'll do my best to answer.
All domestic animals serve a specific function for humans, be it for food, work, or protection, etc.^[1]( So early humans would've picked up on that and began the eventual process of domestication. Grey wolves, were probably the first animals to be domesticated, between 33000-15000 years ago^[2]( which was driven by the need for food. Dogs are just domestic grey wolves (even chihuahuas)^[3]( Dogs where domesticated in Eurasia during the Ice Age, and during that time megafauna (mammoths, aurocs, Irish elk) were fairly abundant, but were quicker, stronger, and better adapted to their environment than the humans were. Early humans will have observed wolves hunting in packs very successfully, and will have wanted that extra advantage during their hunting outings, so getting the wolves in the human 'pack' was needed. The Belyaev experiment is (IMO) an excellent experiment that shows how this domestication process could've/would've took place, and the mechanisms behind it. [This paper]( is pretty in depth, or you can see [this article]( for the short version. Anyway, this partnership between the now domesticated wolf and early man was mutually advantageous - the humans could more successfully hunt for food and have guard dogs for their social groups' security. Companionship was just the icing on the cake. ( ^ _ ^ ) Cats, domesticated from the African wildcat probably in the Middle East around 7500BCE^[2]( would've provided very similar services. Cats are great pest control, and in your fields and huts you don't want diseased rodents running around killing your livestock (or you, because that'd suck). Dogs and cats were useful in protecting livestock, basically.
Eventually our cultures began developing, and religions began to give mythologies to these animals. Anubis, Fenrir and other [dog gods]( had different mythologies surrounding them, as did [cat gods]( like Bastet. In some religions these animals were highly venerated, like in Ancient Egypt. For example, when a pet cat died, all of the family members in the house would shave their eyebrows. Status symbols where common then, and when monotheistic religions (which generally forbid veneration of animals - usually on penalty of death, which is another story...) spread across the world these became more popular, particularly among the rich, as they are today.
As for why cats and dogs...well you could ask that for every animal, but the point is they served a purpose, as did the sheep, cow, horse, chicken, and so on, which are arguably more important to us than pets.
**TLDR**: Cats and dogs were useful, so we used them, and now we have pets. :) Sorry it was long, I may come back later to add/correct stuff later. Have a nice day! 
I bought the A40s when the newer 2013 Mixamp was released. I did not like the closed style of the A40s earcups so I gave them to my brother and looked around some forums. I picked up a pair of Audio Technica ATH-AD700(s) and a Zalman mic for use with the Mixamp. Best soundstage I've had the pleasure of listening to. 
If you don't like hearing anything other than your game, you'll like the A40s or the A50s, but you don't get the depth of direction you do with other headphones. If you want to close your eyes and be able to visualize where the sound is coming from and be able to judge how far away a sound is located, then get just the mixamp and buy your own headphones and mic.
To try and put into words the difference between the A40s and the ATH-AD700(s) when playing a FPS that I have noticed, I would describe it as such: The A40s block out most sounds other than your game audio. When you hear a gun shot or any noise you can definitely tell what direction it is coming from, but when closing your eyes and trying to visualize it, it is like you can only see about a 5 or 10 foot radius around you. Compared to the AD-700s when put in the exact same situation, it is like you have an increased sonar. Sounds can be heard and give not only a directional indication, but more depth of say a 30 foot radius.
It is something you really have to hear for yourself to believe and I was surprisingly shocked when I tried the two pairs back to back.
**TL:DR-The mixamp is the key piece in my opinion. If you don't mind being wired, find headphones with a good soundstage, pick up a separate mic, and enjoy.**
I had the A50s but they had way too many charging problems.  I did research on their support forum and apparently other had the same problem.  81 pages of people had the same problem since 2011 and ASTRO has done nothing to fix it.  I considered the A40s but the A30s were much more comfortable and nearly the same sound quality.
  I recommend the A40s.  A30s if over ear cups hurt the tops and back of your ears.
Finally someone gets it so I'll tell you my secret. 
On here, and in life, most things I have no idea what I'm talking about I just try to sound like I do. Reddit is harder but that just took some learning about conversational tactics. The people around me assume I'm super smart because I'm good with computers. Computers are easy. My knowledge on them is that of an enthusiast and purveyor of the internet, which is a beautiful way to learn but have no actual experience. 
Plus I'm always slightly off conversation on here anyways. I only use it because it's such an efficient source of learning new crap, and I've told some of my darkest secrets here. Hell, some people on here probably remember more of them then my speed induced parents. 
Realistically I probably need some help and the upper portions of this text mean nothing. I appear fine and dandy to those I associate with. If only they truly knew some of the shit that has gone down. Though, that's pretty much life for everyone. So I'm just left feeling like I'm bitching and moaning about it.
upper portion of this text is pointless. Redundant. Move on and enjoy life to it's fullest.

It is not entirely true that there's only one candidate on the ballot, there are districts where more than one candidate compete. It all depends on how many persons decide to present themselves as Candidates. In this picture you can see two candidates.

Yes, Kim Jong Un won the election by 100%, wich is technically 99% as he himself voted for Kim Kwang Hyok, so, at least one vote wasn't for him.
Also, he wasn't the only candidate on all the ballots in all the districts, there were 686 other candidates that get elected. Kim Jong Un is one more legislator on their Supreme Peoples Assembly. He presented himself as a candidate for district 111, which is a military district. I don't know if Kim Kwang Hyok was another candidate for that district or Kim Jong Un just voted for him in order to appear, well, you know, less egocentric.
 elections are not to choose the "supreme leader" charge, but to choose the members of the Supreme Peoples Assembly. There are districts with more than 1 candidate. Kim Jong Un was candidate for a military district (111).


I have the FCM and the only medium like property it has is alpha and speed. Things I dont like: huge, turret armor is nonexistent (no hulldown), the oh-look-a-french-tank response from arty, and the gun dispersion upon movement is bad. Granted the pen is nice, but the engagement distance the FCM prefers is more medium ranges where you rarely have time to fully aim a shot to hit weak points. 
Tanks that fall in this grey zone I find annoying to play. Camo snipers and in your face brawlers are both great to me, but the FCM just doesn't have a great role to me. 
Sometimes this tank will shit a 5k damage game which makes me never rage sell it.
 the fcm is a fickle bitch
My (now ex) Fiancé Came to visit me at work, I worked in a pretty large studio at the time of over 200 people. She poked her head into my team room and said she made a ton of cookies and was putting them in the kitchen/lunchroom.   
I finished up what I was doing real quick and headed over there, when I walk in shes bending over the table reaching for some cookies and her ass looks perfect! I say "now that's what I need right there" in my 'sexy voice' and go in for a squeeze, except she turns around and it isn't her... Its some girl who works on the other side of the building who I only see during meetings and such,  I try to change my gaze so it looks like I was talking about the cookies, I'm pretty sure I even said 'cookies' however, the momentum I had build up still lead me to gently palm her ass....   
I just look at her in complete horror and she just looks at me confused... then my lady walks in who had gone to the bathroom. At this point I feel like my coworker understood what just happened. She grabbed a cookie and left.  
  we even worked with each other after that, and had more chit chats, she never once brought up the time I walked in out of the blue and smacked her on the ass.  
 I grabbed a coworkers ass and didn't get fired. Also would have been a great ice breaker if I was single.
My friend and I are, well, assholes. Whenever we passed eachother randomly on campus, which happened quite a lot, we fell into the habit of muttering insults to eachother, then just saying them, finally almost yelling hateful remarks.
I was walking about 30 ft. behind him one day and there weren't a lot of people around. Needless to say I wasn't feeling tactful. So I sped up until I was only about 10 ft. behind him and I yelled "Cock-sucker" and grimaced at him as we normally do.
Wasn't him.
 Accidentally homophobic to a stranger.  
I was a senior in high school, I wasn't exactly the most popular of people, and I had a friend on the track team that would pat my ass every time we passed.
I always received. I never dished out.
 
Well... after a few weeks of this, I decided that I would one up the competition, so I walked up to him and pinched the cheek and whispered something very awkward into his ear. It was a solid pinch, firm and very thorough.
The guy's ass I just grabbed turned out to be the stereotypical football jock/dick hole, so it especially was surprising to both of us when I whispered "___________? I'm gonna call you daisy."
Needless to say I pretty much turned and made haste for safety.

Then we can also assume that, quoting her correctly, her statement "I know if I didn't end up in the hospital' I would definitely be dead," is baseless speculation?  .24 is far from dead.  
Many people leave nickel night that drunk every week.  None sue the bar for serving them to the point where they'd be "definitely dead" without medical treatment and none sue their friends for peer pressuring them to drink.

It's important to note that you're sweeping a *huge* number of people under the term "Republicans". I find it unlikely that you could find many who embrace all the contradictions you outline. It's much more likely that most "Republicans" would agree with some of the beliefs you ascribe to them, but not the rest, and would contradict themselves much less you think and probably not more than any normal person.
Even though I can't speak for all "Republicans" I do agree (generally) more with their political platform than the Democrats, so let me do what I can to briefly clarify my views. You may or may not find this useful.
1) I think you're confusing social conservatives with economic conservatives. Republicans typically are in favor of smaller government for economic reasons (at least, I am). We think that the Federal government is going to be less efficient than the State governments due to less familiarity with the issues involved and an overwhelming tendency for things to get lost in bureaucracy. As to the government's role in society, we all recognize that there is a fundamental difference between what is legal and what is moral. There are many things I consider to be wrong that I wouldn't dream of trying to pass a law against in the name of free action. However, some conservatives may consider certain things to be bad *enough* for society that they're worth criminalizing. Different Republicans will draw that line differently.
2) Huge military spending is something a lot of people see as necessary, especially in a world where most of our allies are spending a lot less on the military. Take the recent troubles in Ukraine, for instance. I personally think it isn't going to amount to much and that Putin isn't going to invade Ukraine, but if they did...what would happen? France, Germany, Britain, none of them have near the military strength to credibly threaten or dissuade Russia. We do. As for the other issues, I think you're misrepresenting how Republicans think the economy works. I wont' get in to the specific arguments here unless you're interested, but Republicans want a better economy and they think that both smaller government and less taxes (across the board, which includes the rich) both facilitate that. You may disagree, but there is no hypocrisy here.
3) I have never met a conservative who opposes same-sex marriage but is in favor of divorce or premarital sex. Same-sex marriage happens to be a political issue right now; that's why you hear about it a lot more. For my own part, I think it's beneficial to have an institution devoted to a stable romantic relationship organized around the raising and care of children, but I don't think making divorce, same-sex marriage, or premarital sex illegal are good ideas (complicated, don't want to get in to right now).
4) As above, there's a difference between what is moral and what is legal and people make that distinction in different places. I don't think it's hypocrisy to disagree on where to draw the line.
5) Many of the Republicans in your life probably have a *very* different idea of the importance of life than you do. For them, an embryo is valuable because it is a live human being (ideas of "personhood" aside, that's a whole other discussion) and a hardened criminal is no less valuable in that sense. However, a criminal has, through free choice, betrayed his/her commitment to society and some punishment is required. Depending on the severity of the crime the death penalty may be appropriate. My own view is that every human life is valuable and that the only time the death penalty would be appropriate is if keeping a criminal alive is, somehow, a great danger to others (even if locked up). I can't think of any actual examples here, but a fictional character like The Joker may be deserving of the death penalty.
To sum up, I think what you are interpreting as hypocrisy is merely difference of opinion, but the issues are complex enough that you can round off their beliefs to things that seem contradictory. I could do the same thing to liberals, here are a few examples:
1) Liberals claim to uphold free action for everyone, but they want to force religious institutions to perform gay marriages against their wishes.
2) Liberals claim to hold life as valuable, but want to slaughter the most innocent among us (children in the womb).
3) Liberals claim to want equality, but they are in favor of affirmative action, which discriminates against white males.
Obviously I don't believe any of those 3 statements are true, but they *seem* plausible on first glance. A real liberal would (correctly) claim that I was simplifying, misinterpreting, and (perhaps deliberately) misunderstanding their positions. I think you are doing the same thing to Republicans.
I apologize for the length of the response. I'm in the middle of lab work right now and typed this up without sufficient time to proof-read. Please forgive any spelling errors or poorly written sentences. Let me know if you want to get into any of the issues in greater depth.
**tl:dr**: Each of these issues is much more complex than you're making it sound and you're approximating conservative beliefs as contradictory but, in reality, they aren't.
Wow.  My mom died on the LOT flight 5055 coming from Poland.  I was 4, my brother was 2.  
I picked up the phone that morning (mother's day) because my father was making pancakes and was ecstatic to see my mom.  I remember the person on the line asking for my father.  I gave it to him.
A moment later, he dropped the phone, walked to the other room, and started crying so hard.  I've never seen him cry like that before, or since.  I tried to tell him that it would be OK (I was 4, and had no idea what had happened).  He looked at me for one second and I remember him saying distinctly, "No Eric, it's not".
It's amazing that now, 27 years later, I still remember this more than many other things.  
My father has always been unable to talk about it, and he never married again because he "could never find someone like my mom ever again".  I'm grateful I stumbled upon this, and clicked on the wiki link to put some clarity in years of question.
 My mom died on one of the planes, and I was able to read about something my father never could talk about.
Last spring my mom and my step dad started doing meth. My mom was already addicted to pills so it just got worse. Came home one day to screams at me and false accusations. They tried blaming me for their marriage problems and said I was "Making drugs with carpet cleaner". This went on for hours until my mom started hitting me. I shoved her back, said in my most stern voice "I fucking hate you" and walked out the door. I live with my dad now. I get to go to court in May now too because she thinks she'll get custody. I'm 16.

To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risk click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro.
CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed.
Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fag, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. woosh.
Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.

    As a straight white man I am literally the most sexist, racist, homophobic entity that can possibly exist. I am the standard to which all other discrimination is compared.
    When I exhale millions of people all over the world die of oppression. I once said hello to a woman and she internalised her misogyny so much that she become a cis man.
    My gaze turns the Elder Gods into PoC and then oppresses them out of existence (this is why you have never seen Cthulhu). There were too many black people in Game of Thrones so I blinked and in doing so rewrote the universe so they were all slaves. I am the source of the Higgs Boson that gives fat people their shame.
    I am the alpha male and the omega man. I am the beginning and the end of all prejudice. And every other straight white cis abled thin wealthy man is me as well, united across any distance by quantum entanglement (which we created for that express purpose).
     My very existence is oppressive.
I see a huge problem with this system though. The size of  a percentile isn't taken into account very much. With this I mean that near 3.5k is where most of the people is concentrated, as the study posted yesterday showed, and there are very big differences in skill between people with the same rating. That problem isn't present in other brackets, as +25 MMR really marks a bigger difference between players. In my case I'm just right there, at 3.5k, and in my calibration matches I've played with and against good players, but I also lost one of my calibration matches with a very bad line up in our team that leaded us to an Ursa going mid (he called it since the beggining though) against invoker. He still got a flawless 0-13-0, and a flawless -calibration for my solo performance...
 Quantity of players in the same bracket should be taken into account for MMR calculations
OP, imagine a sponge soaked in water. You can squeeze it once and a lot of water falls out right? Right. So you squeeze it a second time and water comes out, but not as much, right? Right. After a while, no matter how hard or often you squeeze it, no water will come out, and you'll end up doing damage to the sponge itself. The only way to combat this is to let that sponge soak in water. So, in this analogy:
Brain=sponge
Lines=squeezing
Dopamine=water
Sleep, vitamins, diet, exercise, water=soaking in water
Lay off the shit for a bit, and in a bit you'll once again be able to feel that shit.
it all depends on spacing. Mine are 10, 7, and almost 3 (all boys). so the older ones could help with the younger. I think the more you have in infant stage the more stress your bringing on yourself. The more self sufficient the older two are the less of an issue it will be for you, and it seemed to me there was less stress each time through with the infants. I had also been thinking 2 but my little guy is awesome. Things get crazy from time to time, but it's manageable even when my wife works crazy hours in crunch time.
 As they get older the direct day to day attention they needs lessens, it's really just hanging out and doing stuff with my older two at this point, where you get crushed is in activities.
/u/weddinggirl2015 beat me to it, but yes, that camera is not professional grade. The biggest issue in this case is that using a high ISO would result in less acceptable (noisy) pictures on that camera than if you used the same high ISO on a better camera. 
The mm (length) of the lens doesn't really matter in this case. It's the other number, the aperture, that matters. If she had a better camera, she could get by with a 2.8 lens, but with that camera, she'd need to have or rent a 1.8 or 1.4 lens (lower number = better for dark situations). 
 Ask if she has lenses 1.8 or faster. But I'd probably cut my losses and go with someone else.
Bosses are imune to CC, and switch targets periodically. However a good tank will build himself to pull agro with one of the 2 agro skills, and have some higher damage mitigation then the other party members that are focusing on dps. 
 had 3 really good dps i could do most fights with myself being a healer.
**HOWEVER, healing generates a lot of threat and some bosses would just target and kill me, thus killing the group healer. I absolutely felt the need for a tank to keep the mobs off me.**
When i was getting hit, nobody had the skills the pull him off me, one guy called himself a crowd control tank... yeahhhhhh ok lol.
I could not pump out heals and tank at the same time... at least not efficiently. I wore light armor to sustain heals, and i was getting hit for a fuckton because i did not have the required damage mitigation. 
 absolutely need somebody that can pull aggro and has some damage mitigation. How much of a "traditional' tank is required. i dont know yet.
He ended it.
I was heartbroken.
He strung me along for months while he was dating the girl he dumped me for.
Told me he made a huge mistake and still loved me. 
I finally grew some balls a year in and told him never to talk to me.
He called me a- a bitch, b- immature, c-selfish.
He told if I said goodbye it would be the end forever.
I did.
Then he calls me six months later wanting to be friends.
He tries to talk to me every once in a while but when convenient to him.
we're not really friends.
Interesting. Well if the nut is spinning, you need to stop it so all the force you apply to it goes into spinning the whole shaft rather than just the nut.
Basically, try putting the hook back on so the nut can't move down the threads as you twist it... THEN try unscrewing it (the nut). The nut shouldn't be able to travel down th threads because it will be running into the hook and the whole thing should start to unscrew.
 Put hook back on &gt; unscrew whole thing from the nut. 
I think the MFLB is quite usable in cold weather, if you let it heat up properly, that is. The current will increase the temperature of the screen by a certain amount above ambient. So if its cold outside the max temp will be lower, but imho still high enough to get you high. I have certainly managed to get a few good hits in close to 0°C, but the batteries seemingly ran out of charge earlier than when in use indors. All/Most materials used in the box are good insulators, so maybe once 'operating temp' is reached it won't matter if you're in a cold or warm environment.
Used in cold weather, still worked well.
Person who grew up with a younger brother with severe disabilities here. Also have a grandma and an uncle with disabilities, too. This is a question I often wonder myself, but I'm going to make my best effort to help take you into my world. I should clarify that not all people with disabilities are as challenged as my brother, but I think the fears and emotions are still the same.
Hardly anyone willingly chooses this, god knows we never did. We all have an assumption that we will grow up, raise our kids, send them to a nice college. There will be some drama, but everything's going to be all right... so we think. Most people never consider this life an option. They don't anticipate a moment where their child might accidentally stray out into a street and might not see the car. They don't anticipate a moment after many long hours of labor that their son might have a freak genetic disorder. But these things happen to our families, whether we asked for them or not.
Don't get us wrong. We mourn the loss of a typical life. Dreams of an honor roll student? Gone. Hours of going out, throwing footballs and fishing at the lake? Gone. Laughing at all the dumb shit he and his friends do when they're over at your house? Not happening. Meeting the girlfriend? You know better than to hope. We DO wish that our loved ones could run, read, communicate with our words, but they are what they are. They never chose it, but there you are. Some families cannot handle this loss and they will mourn it for as long as they care for their child. I've seen these... all they talk about is their hardships, how they can never do the things they want. They're like the morbidly obese person you know that has all these health problems, but will never change their diet or go to the gym. Sometimes it's a damn competition to see who has it worse. This depression drives them mad, and understandably so.
My family wasn't like that. We collectively agreed, "Well, this sucks," but we never took the time to feel sorry for ourselves. We resolved to do our best to be like everyone else. We take my brother out to eat, to Disney World, to visit relatives... we do everything typically developing people can. We also try to give him the best education we can (therapy, teaching functional skills, limited sign language, anything that might help). We know damn well he's never going to be at our level, but that doesn't mean we're not going to try. Anything we would have given a typically developing student, he's going to get too. Somewhere along the way, you discover that even though they'll never be able to take care of themselves, there's still merits. They still smile, laugh, and are sometimes better people to be around than you are. Just because they can't write an essay detailing their love, they still get their meaning across when they hug you after you've been gone for months. They still know happiness, joy, frustration, loneliness... they just communicate it differently and you learn to understand them.
I would say our family is far from miserable... and we've seen some shit.
Anyway, to *** : People find joy in raising children with disabilities not because they want to, but because they HAVE to. If we focus on everything that is wrong with that person and our lives, it will easily drive us to depression and misery. Along the way, we find fulfillment and decide it's not so bad. It's not a realization we reach overnight.
If you want a better idea of what it's like to have a child or relative with disabilities, I found [this poem]( describes it pretty well.
It goes wider than that I believe. 
Recent research has shown that [couples without children are happier](  Its just one study so its not very conclusive but there is a need in modern society to just "feel so blessed" by having children. 
For some people there is also a religious component to this.
So even though a child is a small sociopath that wont let you sleep, 
spends tons of your savings etc etc, we must be grateful for our little
angles.   and I am sure a lot of people feel they are.
When you end up with a child that mentally handicapped, physically handicapped or both, you take on a lot more work than regular parents
have, but again you are required to tell everyone that its wonderful
and how special their child is.   But behind the scenes there is a lot
of pain, extremely hard work, even more money going out. 
I have known two families who had children with disabilities that I were very close to. And the children do feel joy sometimes. and they do love them very much, but they are also honest at least with me that its a hell of a job.
The edge cases we get now with the possibilities of ending a pregnancy if the child is found to have certain defects.  This makes a lot of people feel like we are calling them subhuman and how they would never exist if such things were common years ago.   And how we will rob those kids of their existence. 
I find this to be a very difficult question. It would seem on the face of it that being able to have healthy children would be a great thing. 
 Whilst parents may act like its the greatest thing because of pressure from society. I dont think they really feel that way when alone and honest.   
 
Good one.
We're going to need to do some estimating here.
**How many Webinars are there per year?**
In 2012, a sample of 500 US companies reported 1,200 webinars monthly. So that's  28 webinars per company per year.
There are 18 million companies in the US. Let's assume 5% big enough (more than 50 employees)  to hold webinars, and then that 10% of that number are in business where a webinar is required. So, we come up with 2,520,000 webinars in 2012.
Now, that seems high... 210,000 webinars per month... About 7,000 a day?
US is about 25% of global GBP... so multiply the number per day, 7,000 by 4, then by about 70% since the US would be more tech enabled than the majority. Now we have globally about 
19,600 webinars per day globally in 2012.
**How many Webinars are there in all history?**
2013 is at least as high as 2012 (add 10% inflation), and 2014 is at least as high as 2013...
Then I'm going to do a logarithmic decay back to 1999, and assume the webinars were very infrequent before 1999.
	Year	Ws per day	Ws tot
	2014	23716	1185.8
	2013	21560	7874790
	2012	19600	7158900
	2011	13182	4814734
	2010	8332	3043267
	2009	6460	2359681
	2008	5155	1882698
	2007	4221	1541817
	2006	3540	1292868
	2005	3032	1107477
	2004	2647	966986
	2003	2351	858850
	2002	2120	774460
	2001	1938	707792
	2000	1792	654556
	1999	1675	611642
			
	TOTAL		35,651,703
	
So, 102,547 webinars on average per day from 1999 to 2013. Total webinars in history of the earth is about 35.7 million. Assuming that present day humans are the only beings on earth to use webinars. I'm also going to go with the bleak theory that we are the only intelligent life in the universe.
**How many people attend webinars?**
433 people on average, for an average of 53 minutes.
Assume this is constant over all webinars, so this gives 433 * 53 min * 35.7 million, which is 13,654,655,000 people-viewing minutes. Or about 26,000 human years have been spent watching webinars in the history of the universe!
**How often do people vomit per year?**
I looked around, but couldn't find a reliable answer. The most reasonable seems to be 3 times per year on average. 
What is the chance a single person will vomit in a 53 minute window in a year?  About 0.03%. Number of times a person would vomit in 26,000 years is 78,000.
** About 78,000 people have vomited in webinars in the history of the universe.**




My friend dropped off the face of the earth after grade 8 grad. He was the ideal human: he was smart - smartest in the class, athletic - dominated every sport he played (including running and cardio etc.), and the nicest guy you'd ever hope to meet. 
So, two weeks before the school year ended, his brother (everyone loved this guy too, he was awesome) in senior kindergarten was pulled out for a reason that nobody really knew except the teachers but nobody paid much attention to it. Weird. And at the actual graduation, he showed up halfway through and collected his awards etc. (he got valedictorian and won a lot of awards - we went to a private school, there was valedictorian for grade 8) but his parents didn't stay, they dropped him off and left and they came to pick him up after grad was over. 
Now, he didn't have a phone but he had an iPod 4g and I got his contact info etc. and we texted and stuff as I had an iPod 4g too, up until a few days after grad, where I texted him to see what was going on. The person who replied claimed to have no idea who I was or who I was trying to get a hold of but he did happen to live kind of nearby. Really weird. I was the only one who had his iPod info but most people in my class had his email, which he discarded and no one has gotten a reply since grad. Then, people were starting to get worried about what happened to him.
After grad, my other friend held a post grade 8 party (he did this every year) and he invited the friend who has disappeared. His parents said he couldn't come and he didn't. He was the subject of pretty much every conversation at the party, "What happened to him?" "Is he dead?" "Is he part of the CIA?" "Is he a spy?"... questions like this that nobody has answers to.  
There was also a triathlon that he participated in (before grad, he did really well in it - second place) and come grade 9, the same triathlon was held and he never came, but the grade 8 coaches came and me and my friend who go to the same high school asked them if they had seen this kid, they hadn't and they were hoping we had known where he is, how he's doing etc. But nobody knew anything. Also, he played AA hockey (for those who don't know, AA is the second highest level you can play at the age he was at, AAA is the highest) with another friend outside of school in a league and apparently he quit the team suddenly and wasn't heard from again and the coaches were given a vague and not very good reason as to why he left. 
Now I'm in grade 10 and still nobody has heard from this kid and we've given up the investigation to find out what happened to him but I still think about this friend that just disappeared without a trace quite a bit. Oh, and he never had any social media accounts, only means of virtual connection he had were his email and iPod, both of which are useless. I hope he's doing well.
Edit: A  Grade 8 friend dropped off the face of the earth after grad and no one has heard from him since.
I can only speak for my school, but I've had conversations with administration in passing about how they work the Admission process... When interviews first start it is incredibly hard to get in; as in you have to be an absolute stud. Every month or so they reevaluate the applicants and slowly relax the standards they are looking for. This allows the previous interviewees to filter into being accepted. So I said all of that to say this: they purposefully hold back spots so that they don't fill up too early and miss good students that come in later. 
I was a super late applicant... Took the MCAT on the last weekend and sent in every application the day before it was due. I did it that way and got accepted to two schools. I would suggest to leave yourself a little more room than I did, but I don't think it helps that much to wait a little.
 schools save spots for the end to make sure they don't miss out on good applicants.
Actually, people who need to lose weight need to eat more, in most cases. There is a reason why people who only eat a meal or two a day don't lose weight, it's because their metabolism gets all out of whack and their body hinges on those one or two meals a day for all their energy. If you eat every 3 hours or so, your metabolism keeps burning calories throughout the entire day, rather than going through the peaks and valleys that one or two meals a day would put it through. 
So long as you're eating healthy (lots of protein and veggies; complex carbs like whole grains, broccoli and sweet potatoes &amp; unsaturated fats like almonds, olive oil, avocados and salmon) and exercising regularly, your body will naturally lose weight.
It's not a magic pill or a potion, you just need to set yourself up for success with discipline and planning. For example, I cook all my meals for the entire week on Sunday to help stave off any temptations during the week. When I get hungry, it's easier for me to grab something from the refrigerator than it is to go down the street to the fast food place.
** It's counter-intuitive, but to lose weight, most people need to eat more, not less.**

1/(45*3600/2) pc * 3.086*10^13 Km / pc = 3.809×10^8 kilometers from the nebula (assuming this is being observed from a theoretical planet in a system where the observer is 1au from their own star in the period of one year)
I think you made that too hard.
Someone posted this a few weeks back and it's relevant:

It's a long video (60 minutes) but lots of great advice.  The relevant portion happens near the beginning.  The idea is you actually stop and give them this look that says "hey, now it's your turn to contribute"
 People suck at conversation. SHAME THEM into participating.
I read most of this article and it's really not a good excuse. 
It talks about logic a lot, which is ironic considering how ILLOGICAL it is to assume that math is the ONLY or even the BEST way to teach logic to students. I'd say a critical thinking class would be more directly applicable than math, or even a philosophy class.
In fact, a study of philosophy gives people a much better understanding of everyday logic than math because math is a totally different sort of logic. It's the sort a computer does that requires only the following of a strict set of unchanging rules. However, in life, the rules aren't strict, and they ARE changing all the time, and making sound and moral judgments is a key life skill.
As for actually teaching math, my experience is that students are more receptive to it if they have SOME reason for doing it, even if it's an invented one. I had a chemistry teacher who would give us wonderful problems and a story behind them, and we learned the math involved very quickly. We felt rewarded when we solved those problems. However, in my math textbook, it's all numbers. There's no story or purpose to it.
Math is important to learn but high level math is not necessary or even efficient, and we rarely teach math in an interesting way. It's not that important beyond Algebra II.
The Columbian exchange is both ways and only involves Columbus in name. In fact Columbus never set foot on continental America.
The Columbian exchange is just the trade between the New and Old world. Its not just Europe moving things to the Americas. Things like Coffee, Potatoes, Sugar, and Syphilis were sent to Europe.
The first three became extremely important in Europe. It can be argued that the Enlightenment was caffeine driven. Potatoes were important since they were a cheap but effective crop. Sugar became the first substitute for honey in Europe. All of these benefits to Europe are included in the Columbian Exchange.
- The Columbian Exchange is the trade between the New and Old world. Columbus wasn't involved in the trade except his discovery of the new world.
Has she never moved before?  The change might be too much all at once: parents divorced (recently?), move to new state/city?, no older sister.  Maybe it is all stressing her out.  
Luckily, imo, you guys are in school.  I've had to move all my life due to military, and school makes it so much easier to find friends.  Although, apparently that isn't working out in her case... which makes me wonder if it is stress, and she's trying to compare everything to where she lived before and nothing is living up to the "expectation"?  
I don't really know the situation, and everyone is different... But I think time will definitely help her.  What she may needs is a hobby to help with the stress.  Perhaps when she feels like she's going to cry/etc she should go out for  a run (or insert other hobby).  It's much better than crying, and may help her feel better emotionally and physically.  As for friends, that will come with time for sure.  School will definitely make it easier but if that doesn't work out for her, find a group related to something she likes to do and get together that way.  Like in my case, drawing: find a life drawing group/class or there are subway meets where people get together and draw those who walk by.  If she likes to run, marathons may help her out a lot.  She may not necessarily meet people there, but I've been to large marathons in Seattle, and they have a huge convention going on for it where people get together and talk (salesmen sell stuff, giveaways, etc). This was the marathon:  
After a certain point, there's only so much you can say or do.  She may have just been lashing out at you saying you don't help, due to her own stress and frustration.  That doesn't mean you should stop all together though, that may make things worse. 
This may just be a ramble at this point, but  she may be stressed out from all the change and if she's never moved that makes it all worse.  She should find a distractor (ie running?) for when she gets really upset, and try to make friends while at school and through groups/clubs of things she likes. 
&gt; It actually blows my mind that America was ever close to Pakistan. 
Its not that hard. The US-Pak alliance was filled with pitfalls and pushing the limits of the latter, and thus like any rational country watching its own interests, Pakistan behaved the way it did. It actually blows my mind the simplistic view on Pak-US ties most Americans hold, or expect loyalty from PK as if like a dog, even though the US's treatment of Pakistan has not been kind or compassionate either. If I had to give a  I'd describe it as a stronger country using and manipulating the other(among many countries in the world during the cold war) while the latter returns the favour in its own way.
It has been a largely terrible deal for both sides in different areas(more for Pakistan), yet a necessary one in others. This is not a relationship of love, but of aligning needs and interests.
   I don't know what could have happened, I can only suspect that this would have been a murder/terrorist attack with me as the victim.

   It was a dark, but not so stormy night, in the middle of nowhere. That’s the way the roads in the West Bank are. Long stretches of poorly lit roadway that wind around the hills and mountains. I’m sure you can imagine how hard it is to drive along the winding roads while talking on the phone, so the driver of the vehicle I was in, who was doing just that pulled over onto the shoulder in order to talk safely.
--
   I was sitting right next to the driver, so I saw the entire thing from the front row seats (no pun intended).
A few minutes after the driver pulled over to talk safely, a green plated (Palestinian) vehicle slowly passed by eyeing our vehicle and the occupants within, and pulled in front almost blocking us from moving forward. The driver in my vehicle realized the potential of the situation before I did and threw down the phone in mid conversation, put the car in gear and sped off as fast as he could. After we passed the other vehicle, I noticed it following very close behind ours, and at a relativity high speed for that distance.
--
   A few kilometers down the road however, there was a vehicle checkpoint, and being who we were, we passed right threw without batting an eyelash, and the last I saw of the other vehicle was their headlights getting smaller in the distance, and that was that.

It's a long story, I'm sorry.
Last year there was a guy I dated for a little while. He turned into an aggressive and controlling person. He got drunk one night and when I refused to let him drive me home he threw me against his car. He's 6'5 and 250 pounds. After that, I started distancing myself. I had just moved into an apartment with my 2 friends, so one night he and 2 of his friends come over to drink and hang out. I told him that night I was moving on and I was sorry, that we could no longer date. He sat on my porch and cried for an hour and a half. Knocked on the door countless times. Screamed he loved me. When he finally left I went to sleep. He continued to harass me. He broke into my apartment when I was on a date with someone else and trashed it, writing "SLUT I HATE YOU" in nail polish on my bathroom mirror. I got him banned from coming into my gated community. 
A few weeks later, we throw a party. I was drunk and with the new guy I was seeing. I left my phone on the kitchen counter and a friend of my roommate texts him and tells him to come over. They pretend to be me to override the gate security. I open my bathroom door to him in my house. I was drunk and scared so I yell at him to leave. My roommates let him stay. I lock myself in my room. He tries fighting my new guy. Finally leaves. 
I wake up and pack my things. I call my parents to tell them what happened. I check my phone to see a Vine of him breaking down a door in my house. The next day I was in a new apartment and had an order of protection.
I live in a college town in the South so a lot of us ride scooters to and from campus. I was on my way home in front of my neighborhood when he tries running me off the road. I was thrown from my scooter and slid into the road. I was almost hit by a car. If I wasn't wearing a helmet I would have died. I dislocated my knee and hip. 
I call the police. I told them it was him. They went to question him and his parents vouched for him as well as a neighbor who said his car was at home. I know what I saw, he has a very nice car with a customized paint and wheels. No one else saw it. He hasn't been arrested. This was a year ago. He made me hate my life for so long. 
 Was stalked by ex, he was violent, tried killing me with his car while I was on my moped, was never arrested.
I had an ex-girlfriend try to stab me to death. 
In early 2010 I had moved from Tampa to northern Florida with my parents. I attended the fire academy at a local college in the area. I was dating my high school sweetheart and she had just moved from Tampa to be with me  after us making it work while I was in school. Life seemed great. 
One day, a few months after she moved, I was filling out several applications at her apartment. She woke up at about 1 pm and walked into the living room. This is where the normality of the story stops. 
It's important to note that she had 
no job and was living off a large insurance settlement from a car accident when she was 15. 
So she walks in and I'm ass deep in applications. So she asks me to make her a sandwich. To which I reply something along the lines of, "Go make your own sandwich. In fact, make me one while your in the kitchen doing your womanly duties." Now I was joking. Which was very normal for us. We had a great, healthy relationship and she had an awesome sense of humor. She proceeds to pick up a large kitchen knife and point it at me and states, "Make me a fucking sandwich or I'll cut you." 
I didn't find this funny but thought she was still playing around. Until I noticed her eyes. They were dead, like doll eyes. Seemingly void of any life. This is when I started to get scared. Keep in mind I'm 6'3" and 175 lbs. She was about 5'5 and no more than 125 lbs. But I didn't know how to disarm someone. And I knew people get stabbed trying to take a weapon away from someone. Anyway, so I stand up, put my hands up palm out and ask her to put the knife down and that it's not funny. What she said next I'll never forget. "I'm going to stab you death like a fucking pig." Running for me wasn't an option. She was between me and the door and the only way out was the balcony behind me. But it was a three story fall onto asphalt. She starts taking steps towards me while repeating how she's going kill me. I plant my right foot and put my hands up and tell her that if she gets close to me I'm going to hit her. She didn't stop. She gets within my reach and I swing, hitting her on the top if the head. I couldn't hit her in the face. She instantly crumpled. I kicked the knife away from her and knelt beside her crying my eyes out because I felt so bad. I got up to get some ice and she bolted for the bedroom and locked the door. I heard her talking to a 911 dispatcher and I knew right then that this was about to get worse. 
I waited it out for police to get there, which didn't take long at all. After about 5 minutes after the call there was a knock on the apartment door. I was detained by the officers and taken downstairs to their car and told them what happened. They were very mean at first. Calling me names and taunting me for hitting a woman. Which I still feel about to this day. 
I have no idea what happened upstairs when they talked to her. But only one of them came back. He had a bag with the knife in it. Apparently she was holding the knife so tight that inside of her knuckles split open and bled all over the knife. He apologized for him and his partner and asked if I wanted to press charges for attempted murder. I actually said no. I just wanted to go home and never see her again. And that's exactly what happened. Haven't seen or heard from her since. 
Sorry for grammar. 
Tl; dr- Ex-girlfriend tried to stab me to death for not making her a sandwich. 
Obsessive stalker.  It's hard to talk about, but he got away and when I was in hospital recovering, he was caught because he killed the other woman he did this to.  He's in jail with no possibility of parole, and this helped a lot in the emotional recovery.  "I win because I am alive and free" managed to drown out "I should have died" (&amp; worse) as a mantra.

He waited until I was hammered one night after following me, pushed into my duplex, and beat and raped me, stabbed me, and left me for dead.
I fought hard but I was drunk, an element I find the most difficult to cope with here well over a decade later.  I don't remember a lot but I know I got the phone and he ripped it out of the wall and that's what he used to smash my jaw. (&amp; that's where I will leave off description)
My friend and I were supposed to meet in the morning &amp; he came and saw the door was open and saved my life.  I felt myself draining away, I could see blood pool, I kept wondering what time it was, I distinctly remember my friend's shoes and the sound he made.  I died in the ambulance (i am tod) but came to briefly in hospital, went into coma, and was in hospital and rehab center for a long time.  Very long. 
Doctors were amazingly merciful and did some reconstructive work on me, that i never saw a bill for (but oh god the medical bills) police were horrible at first but then I got a good guy, therapists were sometimes awful and I had one amazing one, I am proud of the work I did to get better on my own..... EMDR &amp; just hard fucking work to move past this as a defining moment in my existence means I have only a few things that trigger me into terrible PTSD.  It has defined my existence, but I at least know I am more than the sum of violence, and that's a lot.
A few stories: I used to get violently ill when I came home, to any home, alone for years, until I got a dog who'd hang with me while I was nauseous or puking in the bathroom.  He started greeting me at the door and being super hilarious and sweet so this helped change that reaction to coming home. He was an old man rescue dog that I met in the rehab facility... Animals are a big part of how I became 'OK' again.
Lots of really excellent coping methods have helped, a ton of stubbornness, and I live a 'normal' life, better than normal honestly! Cats, partner who knows how to manage if I go into reactive mode (the thing I hate but it happens), a safe home, and the realization that I can do anything I want because the worst that can happen to me already has.  I'm not fearless, I have to battle a lot of shit just to leave the house to the grocery store, some street harassment and I can be fucked up and inside for days, but when all is balanced and I'm in control (no really, gotta be in charge) I can try just about anything once.  
Where I am now emotionally is I am able to help loved ones in the worst times of their lives (death, illness in family, &amp; similar) because I can manage these huge emotions by handling the details noone was there to handle for me (paperwork is evil when you're completely destroyed emotionally), I have travelled all over the world &amp; love life boundlessly, but I have severe and occasionally debilitating musculoskeletal and migraine issues ... And of course, I take a sleep aid and low dosage of antidepressant.  I've managed to come up with work that allows me to work from home which has made all the difference.
Shit, went on and on.  These stories are out there and not everyone is as lucky and stubborn as me.
As I'm writing this I can't figure out why I'm putting this story out there... But here it is. 
*** stalker took his moment when I was very drunk, tried to kill me, killed another woman a month later, is in jail.
Edit: bold type
I nearly got killed by two separate people on two separate occasions on the same night. 

When I was about 15, I had the worlds shittiest boyfriend. Anyway, I went to a house party in the summer with him and some of his scummy friends. A girl turned up, she was a total bitch and really drunk. She was making comments at me all evening and putting me down. She was off her face on some drug or the other. She flirted with my boyfriend all evening and he flirted back.  He cheated on me a lot and had even come onto girls in front of me many times. It was pretty abusive too so don't ask me why I stayed with him. I told her she was a cunt and tried to leave.
I got my jacket, and went to walk out of the door. She shouted something after me along the lines of how she is going to kick the shit out of me if she sees me again because I had "given her cheek"
I tell her I hope she dies of a drug overdose. 
She got up, stormed over to me, then smashed the bottle of beer she was drinking on the bannister near the door, and punched me in the face, then dragged me to the floor by the hair and stabbed me in the chest and arm. I panicked and managed to wrestle the bottle off her. I lashed out, stabbing her in the neck. We both could have died. I looked her up on Facebook not long ago and she has a giant scar down her neck. Mine healed up pretty nice. 
Anyway, as luck would have it, I lived in a bad area, and decided to stumble home through the park. This park is huge, and there's been quite a few murders/rapes on it.  I was very drunk, to the point of stumbling.
So I'm stumbling through the park (it was still quite a little light at this time as it was summer so I thought I was okay) covered in blood (the wound wasn't too deep, just big) and an older, slight chubby Asian man walks towards me in the opposite direction. I ran towards him crying and ask him for help. He only spoke a little English but he mentioned his car and hospital. Great, I think, he will give me a ride to the hospital. 
But it turned out that he, also, was a bit of a cunt. 
He walks me down the path through the wooded area and he says that his car is in the car park which is in that direction. He's leading me down it and I'm stumbling behind. He must have thought he had hit the jackpot. Drunk, weakened vulnerable girl, dark, secluded park. Anyway he starts getting a bit rough whilst leading me, pulling my arm and stuff. I trip a few times. I start to feel a bit anxious and scared. I know something isn't right. 
We reached the end of the footpath, and there is a fork in the path. One leads to the car park, one leads off onto another, deeper part of the park. He pulls me in that direction. As he pulls me I stagger a bit and for a second he lets go of my arm. I start screaming and run in the direction of the car park, and the bridge at the other side of it that leads to a main road. 
Luckily, as he was a bit fat, he wasn't too fast. I manage to make it across the car park and over the bridge, and run into the road into oncoming traffic. People stop and help me. 
I'm very lucky. 
A week or so later, I was out with friends and my dad phoned me saying that a group of teens had come to the house and broke his car window. They were looking for me. I was drunk again at this point and furious. I knew who it was. 
I got a taxi back to my house with a few friends, and on the small park next to my house there is a group of about 30 kids around my age and some a little older. I could see the girl who stabbed me. I walk onto the park, and my dad comes onto the park too. She comes over to me and starts screaming in my face about how I ruined her modelling career by scarring her. (Doubt it. She was not pretty. Although her sister is a pretty successful glamour model now, which must piss her off so bad).
Someone in the area must have phoned the police at this point. An officer comes up to us, and asks what all the commotion is about and asks the drunk teens to leave the park. My dad explains to the officer what had happened. As he was explaining the girl jumped on me and starts hitting me in the face. I manage to get on top of her and just beat the absolute shit out of her. The police went to pull me off and my dad told him to leave it. My dad, the policeman and the huge group of friends watch me repeatedly punch her in the face for a few seconds, then he arrests *her* because she hit me first and I guess he felt sorry for me, and I was actually being polite and trying to calm her. I never had any trouble off her again. 

 Drug induced whore stabs me because she wants my boyfriends dick. Fat Asian then tries to rape me. Then my dad and a police officer watches me beat the living shit out of said whore.
Oh; and as a side note, my boyfriend ended up fucking her behind my back for a few weeks after this. She was and still is a cunt.

Never expect a miraculous event. You'll be disappointed if you set your expectations ridiculously high. My first time was with the guy I'm with now. It was insanely awkward since I had never made out with anyone, and he only had gotten really awkward oral from some random girl on a cruise. I had just given him oral for the first time a week before. So we were both pretty inexperienced. It started with making out. Eventually I said "so...do I take my pants off now?" He said "yeah I think so" we awkwardly figured out how to put the condom on. And the condom was way too small and didn't even fit him (he's pretty big, not trying to brag, just trying to point out more awkwardness) then he put it in, which hurt both of us pretty badly. we kinda stayed there with it in and didn't move becauAse it hurt. Then we were going for about 10 minutes when we heard something at the door. We freaked out, I hid in the closet because we thought his mom came home. He took the condom off and ran into the bathroom. After about 5 minutes of complete silence, he opens the closet door to tell me it was just his cat scratching the door, and that was our only condom. so i just finished him off, and we walked to school together still proud that we'd finally lost our virginities. 
We got cock-blocked by his cat. 
I currently am a landlord in a lower rent area outside of Portland.  The neighborhood is called Rockwood.   If you live in Portland, the mention of Rockwood gives people a fright.  It is not an easy area to be a landlord in.
I have been doing it for ten years, though, and it has been very good for me.  I have not made a fortune, but I have done well.   I get a steady and dependable 8% cash over cash and the property has appreciated nicely.
BUT, it has, at times, not been easy.  I had to spend a lot of money and put a lot of work to bring the property up to a nice level.  I have been to court about a dozen times to start the eviction process.  I have more than a few tenants that have fallen on hard times and failed to pay rent and skip out.   I have tenants that have friends that cause trouble and, a few times, quite a bit of damage.
Ninety percent of my tenants today and over the years are good people looking for a decent place to live, and I do my best to provide that.   But it can be hard and it can be risky.   If you find the right tenant, they probably will never move because they can't afford it.  BUT, they are always one paycheck away from missing rent.
Yes, good people deserve a place but if you are cash poor, then you might stear clear because it IS risky.   If you are smart and get a small place and have the time to devote to it AND have the cash reserves to weather any tough times, THEN it can be profitable.
Also, remember that no matter how well you do, when you want to sell the place it will be far more difficult than selling a place in a better neighborhood.   That is just the fact of life.   
 It can be profitable, but also very risky and hard.   Make sure you are prepared for the challenge.
However, if you have not rented in these neighborhoods, how do you know what its like? There are too many people who haven't been there saying how horrible it is, but if you haven't done it in these neighborhoods you really can't say from experience if its worth it or not.
Your properties sound like they are in good neighborhoods. The thing is, most "good neighborhoods" cash on cash return isn't that great, or the cap rate isn't that great (Depends - I wouldn't get out of bed for 8% return on investment...that's too low for me), but for someone else it may be worth it. People who follow myself into these lower cost neighborhoods, own our homes outright in 2-4 years, taking us closer to the number that magical income stream that means we can quit our full time jobs and do real estate investing full time. 
Waiting 6 months? Yeah, you didnt know what you're doing. Now, there are so many "how to invest in lower income neighborhoods" by experienced investors, its easy to figure out how to do it successfully. I'll say this alot, this isnt the same game it was 4 years ago. Property management too: you dont have to deal with day to day yourself in most cities. 
- real estate is local and nuanced, there isn't one brush to that describes every neighborhood. You can do just as well with a property in my area as yours, you just need to learn how to read the RELEVANT factors to judge that neighborhood...Like, CRIME is relevant factor, not schools
Personally, I think it makes you more human, and your stories believable. There's not a person here who hasn't fucked up. Everyone's done shit that they squirm to remember. And everyone's gonna fuck up some more. The thing is to own it, learn from it, move on, and not do that again. 
It's easy to judge some random person on the Net and get a nice high from feeling superior, and also easy to post that you think that person's shit. But it makes you shitty to do that as well, unless the person you're chastising was being an ass to someone else for no reason. 
 fuck the haters
"Argentina" and "long term planning" is kind of an oxymoron really. There are zero opportunities for personal growth here. The only thing you can do is try to survive and make ends meet. 
Picture this: A giant turd hanging from a string. Below it, a powered fan, on full throttle. There is always this lingering fear that the country will go to the shithole. When the day ends and that hasn't happened yet, you go to sleep fearing that tomorrow will be the day. Perhaps you could go to Brazil or Uruguay?
 Don't go to Argentina. 
I've only ever seen this work on droplets of water. When water is poured on a hot surface (around a few tablespoons or so), it tends to break up into small droplets rather quickly, and the effect is seen. If it was desired to move a lot of water, say gallons or hundreds of gallons, it would most likely cool the surface to below a temperature where the leidenfrost effect would work. The amount of energy required to maintain a high temperature would be prohibitively high for any useful application. 
Additionally, the force that pushes the droplet uphill is caused by a small "explosion" of steam. The steam is produced by the droplet itself as the part of it touching the hot surface evaporates almost instantly. You can see this in the slow motion gif as microscopic specs of water shoot off the rear of the drop. If more than a droplet was present on the surface, these small steam explosions would knock some of it forward, and some of it backwards. Most likely, these explosions wouldn't be able to move a large body of water.

 No
I (25m) have a lot that's great right now. 6 months ago my fiancee left me and my emotional state took a dive into the shitter. I was in a bad place for a bit after it happened. Brutal depression, suicidal thoughts, plummeting grades and excessive drinking came as a result. 
A couple months ago I decided to change that. Started working out 4 times a week after 2 years away from the gym and became extremely focused on becoming the best me. All of that has led up to getting in incredible shape, dating again, regularly having sex, an 85% average in university this semester, promotions at work, trying all kinds of new things I wouldn't have in a relationship and truly coming out of my introverted shell and bettering myself on a social level. 
Right after the breakup I couldn't picture my life without her. Now that I'm on the path to truly finding myself and being happy, I couldn't imagine life with her. Seriously, my entire outlook on life has gone from one polar extreme to the next over 6 months and now I feel like I'm in control of my life.
crushing breakup turns out to be the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Edit: broke up wall of text
Don't read this if your day is going well.
1. My friends are still awesome and completely trustworthy
2. My overall health.
That's about it. I can't think of anything else that's good. My boss told me we'll talk in the morning. That can't be good.
I still have feelings for my roommate. I've got the jealousy under control but I still can't fucking get her out of my head.
I'm 2 months late on rent and owe the previously mentioned roommate around $250.
I'm 19, I don't know where my life is going. I didn't even graduate highscool and I'm stuck working full time to live.
Sometimes I don't even know why I bother trying to make it work. If I found a way to off myself painlessly without a gun (Canadian), I would have already done it.
I'm a boring person to be around and I'm not outgoing, so odds are that I'll die alone. I'm basically living my life waiting for death to come around. In the meantime I escape my problems and stress by drinking and smoking weed.
 I live a sad life.

Sunt OK cu automatizarea, pe masura ce evoluam ca societate, intampinam probleme noi, gasim solutii unicate la probleme unicate care reprezinta societatea intr-un anume punct temporal.
Lumea are tendinta sa priveasca automatizarea ca un lucru care se va intampla peste noapte, maine, facand comparatie intre ziua de maine si situatia prezenta de acum. Evident ca situatia pare gri in felul asta de a privi. Joburile dispar si apar in functie de nivelul socio-technologic, faptul ca azi nu putem percepe cum o sa arate lumea peste 50 de ani nu inseamna ca trebuie sa ne panicam ca "Dey terk err jerbs!"
Este adevarat si faptul ca exista o incongruenta globala intre societati, orice probleme vor aparea in viitor for fi un rezultat direct al acestor incongruente, altfel spus, posibila lipsa a joburilor va fi doar un simptom si nu un rezultat direct al automatizarii.
** O societate care e proactiva nu va avea probleme, una reactiva se va chinui, una obtuza e fucked.**

While I understand where you're coming from, I think you're letting yourself think too much of it.
First and foremost: it's OK for him to manage his money as he wishes to — so if he bought the ring because he wanted to, it's also OK if he wants to buy a separate engagement ring (if/when he decides to propose).
If you're worried about the amount being spent on such an item, just let him know that you worry. Take care to communicate clearly that you really liked the gift, but worry about the cost so he understands that's it's just an opinion on finances.
Regarding a proposal, I really don't think you should bring that up if it hasn't naturally been the subject of a conversation until now.
As time goes by, what both of you expect from the relationship will naturally come up and you can raise the question about this vs a different ring then.
 it's his choice, don't worry about it. If the price worries you, let him know that.
I have my doubts that Fox, even Fox News, represents an authentic belief in cultural conservatism. Their high god is Mammon not Jesus or Yahweh or whoever. Murdoch and underlings saw an untapped market : angry, scared, under-educated conservatives, and so they designed a 'News' entity to cater to them, grow them, and reap the profit.  
Why not air a show that will sell advertising time? 
Worst that can happen, some of these cultural conservatives will see it, get angry and fearful and watch more Fox News to be comforted. 
Win-Win for Fox. 
 Money. 
My boyfriend is going to take his two-year MBA in another *continent* in a year or two. We both know we will be very bad at maintaining a long distance relationship (but of course we are willing to try, do whatever it takes). But we see the benefit of our relationship enduring that difficult time.
However, the option to move in with him (we don't live together atm) for the duration of his studies has recently presented itself. If I didn't get a job there (extremely unlikely as I will go insane), he will be able to support me. 
***: bf will move away for 2 years, not sure if we can LDR but I could move in with him.. but I don't know if I can do that either.
So, if any redditors have done it, or have endured the long-term LDR coming from a non-LDR relationship, I'd really like to hear both sides of the coin. I think it would really help my decision.
Hypperrealist painting is about enhancing and exaggerating all the subtleties of real life, to create a *painting* that resembles real-life itself. Hyperrealist painters add a lot of subtle detail that is *designed* to be missed to trick your mind into thinking it's look at a real, three dimensional, real life object. They generally add strong lighting, glare, vivid color, reflection, high contrast, moisture, creasing and transparency in their paintings that may not be present in real life or photography. 
Hyperrealism to amateur artists is similar to abstract art to non-artists. "But it's not *real* art, it's just a few shapes!"
Hyperrealism is about mimicking real life. Photorealism is about mimicking photography.
When attempting realism, these are usually simpler than living beings.
 Training?

I'm a pretty big fan of Tim Morrill.  
  
**The Foundation** - If you're looking for a base of knowledge to help you understand and create your own program then the foundation ebook is definitely for you. The best part of it is the comprehensive exercise directory he gives you which link to youtube vids of all the movements (alot of which I had no clue on). Tim doesn't really dumb it down at all, so it is a tough but worthy read.  
  
**FUTURE** - This is a more hands on video product where its like hours of content where he guides you through every aspect, like prehab, warm ups, asymmetry and just a whole mess of information including the hows AND whys. [link](  
  
**explosive ulti** - I would say this is like a live presentation of some of the things he addressed in the foundation as well as subjects he further expands upon in FUTURE.  
  
I have all 3, and have had some distance coaching and programming done by him. As your mid to upper level league player, and mid-level mixed club player, it's helped alot, especially on the prehab. I use to get injured all time and i'm enjoying prolly some of the fastest ultimate i've played, and the most injury free.  
  
The dude is an open book too, so you can always send him an email or twitter or something and he'll get back to you. Additionally he just finished filming a new video series on bulding agility that should be coming out relatively soon too.   
  
- super aweosme guy, in order of favorites i'd rank future &gt; foundation &gt; explosive ulti. but they're all good. see if you can get him to bundle them for you at a discount?
I was dating but not really looking for a relationship when I met my SO through mutual friends. Within 3 weeks of our first date, he dropped the L word on me. To my surprise, I responded in kind (and meant the shit out of it). 
We're still new as a couple, but six months in and we still can't wait to see each other every day.
 Fastest attachment was 3 weeks, with my current SO, and I couldn't be happier.
Ultimate edition was blocked on my country, too. So I found a brazilian and bought from him. (in brazil games are cheaper) it wasn't a %75 off deal, so i gave more than this price, it was around $12 and it's one of the most expensive games i've ever bought. But worth it.
Now, my humble opinions about the game.
*story: definitely one of the best game stories. It's not the best but hey, a branching, decent story. It's impossible to find that this days. Also i sensed some Wheel of Time. (blight, darkspawn, aes sedai (reverend mother) and lots more.. )

*graphics: not the best side of the game, but it's good in general. But, character models are more than well-made. There are some good scenery, too.

* gameplay: if you play it as an arpg, you'll suffer in pain. I might say it's a tactical rpg. You can pause the battle, give commands, and then continue the fight by commanding all characters from top, or select one and play as him/her. I loved it.

The only bad thing about the game is, it doesn't let me get involved in romance with both morrigan and leliana. I love both of them, but they  don't like each other :(

Tl, dr: best rpg. Buy it.
It's easy enough to do. Any professional front end dev should be able to easily achieve "pixel-perfection". I've found that often the PSD isn't quite perfect, but either way I always try to make sure everything lines up right. I think it's more important in tech-related industries: If I'm looking for a web designer and his site isn't perfect, I'll probably look elsewhere. If I'm trying to buy some weird niche product, I won't expect them to have a perfect design.
But ya, why not do it perfect? You should be using a framework that encourages perfection, so it shouldn't be hard once you have your initial starting template set up. I'm pretty sure there's a Chrome (also Firefox?) add on that allows you to overlay an image on top of your website, so you can be totally sure everything lines up. But even with that, what about the differences in scroll bar and top menu widths and heights across browsers?
One place where it's quite a bit harder to maintain consistency is responsive designs. For example, foundation is fluid so it's gonna look different on literally every screen resolution. Bootstrap serves a few views that are designed to apply to most resolutions, but its still not gonna look exactly the same between, for example, two mobile web browsers like iOS Chrome and iOS Safari and android Chrome, or even the same mobile browser on different devices like iPhone 4 vs iPhone5.
In that case, I usually ask for a design for each breakpoint, and just try to keep things as consistent as possible on each breakpoint.
use a framework that ensures consistency and you don't have to worry about manually lining things up. Just set up the framework correctly.
Not sure if this qualifies as crazy, but here's the story.
My old house was pretty open planned - you could almost see the whole way through - and the home computer was in a little alcove right before the kitchen. My little brother (who at the time was 12) was/is an avid gamer, and whenever our parents would go out, he'd jump on the computer with his headphones on and the volume turned up pretty loud. 
I was with a girl who lived a 6 hour drive away, so we didn't see each other a lot. Anyway, we were on the couch and my parents were out, so we were fooling around with each other while - of course- my brother was on the computer. One thing led to another and before i knew it, i was holding her off the ground against the living room wall going at it like nothing else. We were into being slightly violent towards each other (me more to her than anything) so when i got tired of holding her against the wall i laid her down on the dining table and continued, slapping her face occasionally. We finished and cleaned up, went back to the couch and finished the movie.
My brother was about 5 meters away the whole time and had only needed to get up and take two step backwards to see what was going on.
- had sex while my brother was 5 meters away, without a door separating us.
In my group of friends there was this one kid that no one really liked, I'll call him John, but we weren't jerks so we included him. Anyways, this one night there are 5 of us sleeping at his house in this formation: John was on the top bunk, my friend and I were on the lower bunk (no homo), and 2 were on the floor. We were whispering on the lower bunk so as not to wake anyone when all of a sudden the upper bunk mattress starts to squeak and the bed starts to shake a little. We're freaking out on the bottom bunk and try making noises but nothing works. After I coughed the squeaking stops...for a few minutes. When it resumes its obvious that things are getting a little more intense so I coughed again. This time John stopped for only 10 or 20 seconds. I coughed again but he kept going faster and squeakier. Then it stopped. No more movement. No clean up; no changing pants, nothing. It made for quite an awkward morning. Especially when he tried to give us good morning high fives.
Host jizzed over 4 sleeping friends.
Created a throwaway just for this. 
I was about 12 or so when I decided it was time to get some pussy. Of course, I wasn't actually going to have sex with anyone, but that wouldn't stop me from trying to have sex with *anything*. 
I don't remember how I got it, but I was given a stuffed tiger doll for one reason or another. Eventually it became torn at the seam, which happened to be right around it's tail. The hole was impossibly perfect. Cotton isn't the best stimulant for a penis, but it did the trick. I eventually threw it away because it become too full of cum, but my excuse to my parents was that I was too old for stuffed animals. 
*: Horny 12 year old me Ass fucked a tiger doll. 
Posted this before, but it's relevant. 
When I was 13 or 14, I read on the internet you could masturbate by carving a dick-width-sized hole through a cucumber and microwaving it. I did this late at night and decided to give it a go. I went at it, and it turned out to feel pretty great. Before long, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. With no way to explain what I was doing, I immediately pulled up my pants and began munching on the cucumber. Midnight snack, I explained to my mother.
I'm allergic to cucumber. My mother knew this. Told her I was testing if I still had my allergy.
Side note: I had *not* finished into it, but still pretty gross. 
*** Ate a dick-filled cucumber. 
My family used to take a summer vacation every year to a popular vacation spot in my state that was a only a few hours away. So when I was a junior in high school my parents invited my girlfriend to come along. The rest of my family had driven over the day before, and it was just me, my girlfriend, and my mom.  My girlfriend and I were in the back seat, and one thing led to another and she started giving me a handjob. After a few minutes the sound due to the lotion was too obvious in an otherwise silent car. Well I was already worked up so the only reasonable thing to do was for her to give me a blowjob. Things are going great and about 10 minutes later I came, only I couldn't warn my girlfriend and she kind of chokes/coughs. My mom cleared her throat very loudly (you know, the super obvious kind) and we both froze. To this day I still don't know if she knew what was going on, but it certainly seemed that way at the time. The next 2 hours was the most awkward car ride ever.
 girlfriend gave me a blowjob in the backseat while my mom was driving.
I was with my first GF, aged maybe 15. Used to go over to hers every couple of weeks as she lived in a different town. Locked ourselves in her bedroom while her parents were downstairs watching TV, she tried to do something different to spice up whatever it was we were doing (hadn't had sex yet, just dry humping). So, we get nekkid and she pulls out this squeezy bottle of chocolate sauce saying she wants to lick it off my body. Hey, I'm not gonna turn down that kind of service. She goes to town with that chocolate sauce, all over my navel, cock &amp; balls (also, was not shaving at this point). After a couple of minutes of licking the chocolate sauce she says to me "it's not coming off". I look down at her, with chocolate smeared across her face and my entire crotchular region, and see this massive, sticky mess. Pick up the bottle of chocolate sauce, and it's the incredibly viscous stuff that's supposed to freeze when it hits ice cream. It's not body chocolate. At. All.
So, we had to tip toe down the hall to the bathroom to get some scissors to cut this shit out of my pubes, then shower it off, when her Dad gets mad thinking we're having sex in the shower, which at the time felt like the most unfair accusation ever. Once it was all off I grabbed my clothes and just ran out of the house. Haven't been able to look her Dad in the eye since, which is awkward, because the GF and I didn't break up for another 3 months.
I got chocolate stuck in me nethers.
At a mates 18th. Dress up party. I am in a six year olds dearth vadar costume from k mart which I had to cut to get it on. (Most of my stomach was showing). Spot 9/10 blonde girl I've been talking to lately on the dance floor. She's dressed in slutty Egyptian type gear. I walk over to her, imperial march playing in my head. I place my light sabre on her shoulder and say "how bout it then?". She nods. Win. I lead her to the tiny pool shed at the back of the house. She undresses me and starts gettin on deez nuts. Then I say "reveal yourself cleopatra". She obliges. Win. We start getting freaky, then my mates come banging on the door thinking they are being funny, I trip over and bang my head on a pool filter, get knocked out, blonde screams and gets dressed and leaves. My mates then carried me to the dance floor where I regained consciousness and quickly realised I was naked in front of the entire party so I ran.
I got knocked out while trying to fuck a chick at a party
When I was 13-15 I was a chronic masturbator (3-4 times a day). Me and my family used to go to our log cabin in the mountains in the easter and summer, to go skiing and hiking. We have one main cabin with two bedrooms, living room and kitchen, and a smaller annex with four more beds.
**The first time**, I was sleeping in a bunkbed in the annex with my mother and my stepdad at the time. Mind you, this is the Norwegian mountains in the winter, it's easily down to -25C (-13F) during the day here. We had to keep the fire going all the fucking time in both cabins, if we didn't want the place to become an ice tomb.
They used to send me down to the annex to check on the fire every once in a while, and while I was there, I of course could not resist the urge to masturbate. I mean, here I was, in the middle of fucking nowhere with my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle and two retarded cousins. I had played through Pokemon Silver 2 times on my Game Boy already, the fuck was I supposed to do? All I needed now, was some porn.
I was in luck though, my mom used to buy these womens magazines, filled to the rim with ads of half naked fitness girls playing on old womens insecurities. Some of these ads were plain out hardcore porn for a thirteen year old, and I had an endless stack of magazines there. I glued several of them together, and regrettably had to use them to keep the fire going (i.e. destroying evidence). By the end of the trip, I was spending 90% of my time in the annex, "keeping the fire going". My mom would sometimes walk in on me (I was in my sleeping bag), and wonder why I didn't want to spend time with them, and only by myself and I'm all "GAWD shut up mom, I have a right to some privacy THESE MAGAZINES ARE INTERESTING OK I AM AN ADULT". My stepdad would also come rage at me for being selfish and asocial, while I was jerking my dick under the covers. Fucking asshole.
**The second time**, same place, but this time I was sharing the double bed with my cousin, because of logistics with my uncle, and aunts new baby or something like that (I don't even remember excactly why I had to share a bed with this retard for two weeks, but I had to anyway.)
This time I didn't have a place to run away and fap to, as the bedroom was directly by the livingroom where everyone else hung out after skiing. Instead, I had to wait until my cousin was sound asleep and then furiously jack off. By the time we had come to that part of the night, I was so fucking horny and was sporting the most raging boner imaginable. I would seriously fap 2-3 times in 30 minutes while my (disgusting, retarded) cousin (I really hate this guy) was sleeping half a meter away from me. Some nights he would seem to be sleeping, and then suddenly walk out of bed and stand and stare our the window for a couple of minutes, before going back to bed. I have no idea why, he was like 10-11 at the time, and I don't know if he noticed that I was involved in some of the most intense fapping sessions in my life - or (if he did notice) that he had any idea what I was doing at all.
**I also remember driving home** from the cabin the second time. I wore a blanket over myself, and when the time was right I would slip my sweat pants down and beat it, not once, but twice (it was a 10 hour trip) during the drive. My brother was driving the car at that point, and I had to spread my legs to get into a good position for the faps. He is a tall motherfucker, and had to have his car seat real far back to be able to drive. I ended up kneeing the back of his seat while doing business, and yeah, well: - "Molochkwalker, stop doing that! I can't concentrate on the road" and I was all "YEAH CHILL IN A MINUTE BRO".
**The worst part** was when I got home, after both vacations. No showers at the cabins, meant up to two weeks without a proper wash. I am no circumcised. You cannot, and I mean not, grasp the amount of dick cheese that accumulates under your foreskin after two weeks of cumming 3-6 fucking times a day. I COULD HAVE STARTED A FUCKING YOGHURT COMPANY. 
Now I need to lay down.
**** Masturbated constantly on several vacations, missed social interactions to fap, fapped vigorously next to my sleeping cousin every night, fapped in a car with my brother and mother, accumulated huge amounts of dick cheese.
When I was 14 I went to a concert with my gf 15 and her dad drove us. On the way back she whispers in my ear that she's soaking wet... So emboldened by this information I proceed to start fingering her... Now we were in an extended cab ( not crew cab) f150 so her dad is pretty much a foot away. But with two fingers already in I was like fuck it. Slipped her pants down and had her lay sort of in front of me on the bench. Got my dick in after some maneuvering and went to work... About halfway through she moans, audibly. I look up at the rear view, her dad is mean mugging the fuck out of me... Closed my eyes and kept pumping away. Got mine, nothing was ever said about it. If he knew he was too embarrassed to say anything.
 fucked gf in extended cab truck while her dad was literally a foot away. Got crazy stares but we pulled it off.
At a house party when I was 16/17, it was a friends house so me and my ex had claimed a room for us to sleep in for the night as it was quite a hike home and alot of underage drinking. I'd only lost my V about 3 weeks earlier than this. Later on in the night, people are havin a good time, drinks are flowing so me and her slip away for some fun times. 
Were in the middle of doing the dirty when suddenly the door bursts open, and theres about 10 people stood there just watching my horn riddled body pumping furiously into my ex. No one left and they just stood there watching, male and females as we did the dirty, friends we had grown up with since we were little. Got handed a beer as I pumped away, gf didnt care and everyone seemed to be enjoying seeing my white skinny ass popping up n down. They refused to go until i had blown my load.
unwittingly took part in a voyeuristic sex show
When I was 14 with my first real girlfriend we were at a park that had a tree all the kids called "smokers tree". (Very easy to climb and hide while smoking) after we were perched on a high branch for an hour or so things started getting hot, and it happened. 
Lost my virginity in a tree 25 or so feet from the ground.
Ok so, story time, I aint even gonna use a throwaway. 

I watched that top gear episode and thought to myself, 'It can't be that bad, can it?'. So evening comes. The time is right. I head into the shower and my toothpaste is sitting there, looking at me, just daring me to do it. I give in, put a bit on my finger and plonk it right on my ball sac. Hmm. This isn't so bad, I don't even feel anything really, it's not that... ba... ooh it's getting cold.. really cold, ow it burns... it FUCKING BUURNS!!! 

I grab the shower head and hose that shit off as fast as I can but it doesn't go away, I grab the soap and lather up as much as I can but without the warmth of the hot water from the shower head it's just agony. I'm running around the shower like a dog whos lost his tail. Fucking nothing works. Nothing is getting this burning stupidity off of me. 

Eventually it went away but, needless to say I was sitting in that shower for a good 40 minutes with warm water on my balls.
Don't put toothpaste on your balls kids. 
I posted this a while back but it applies well here too. This'll be buried anyways but like I always say, "fuck it".

When I had just turned 16, I had an 18 year old girlfriend. Just for context i had a lot of senior girlfriends in high school, about one per summer. anyways one day after i had come back from being gone for about two weeks we decided to head out to a big agricultural park facility about 20 minutes outside of town. So we find a spot hidden away in field and do our thing, usual couple stuff, in the back of my car. After we passed out practically cuddling naked since we were tired and lazy and well, I don't know. Anyways out of no where i wake up from my nap to see a cop standing beside my back window looking through the glass right at me and my naked girlfriend. WE get out and he immediately asked how old i was. Thankfully having just turned 16 they couldn't get us for underage stuff but they still kicked us out for being sketchy. Scariest time getting caught ever. he made us give me phone numbers and i was sure he was gonna call up my house and tell my parents. alas that never happened but still... really got us scared.
 Caught by cops at 16 with my older girlfriend in broad daylight in back of my car buck naked.
Not too crazy but crazy enough for me. 
Throwaway. Prom '98, my then-gf and I went to an after prom party where camping was supposed to happen on this girl's property. I brought a huge tent for us...a love nest if you will. I came prepared to lose the V. Anyway, it rained, so we set the tent up in a large garage, and all these people at the party fucked me over by passing out in the tent with our sleeping bag in the middle. Foiled. We got naked anyway, and she was on her period. Foiled again. No intercourse, but we fingered, sucked, rubbed, and licked our way to a great night while 5 or 6 people snoozed away in the tent with us. It was the first time I ate pussy, too, and I enjoyed it despite I had to dodge a tampon string the whole time.
Tried to fuck, she was on period, ate pussy anyway
One time I was having sex with my ex in my car in this back cul de sac (?) in a neighborhood that was being constructed, and we were in the backseat. It was so fucking hot I opened the door and her head was hanging out the door while we were fucking. I see this black SUV pull in and drove around the side so the front of his car was facing the side my girlfriend was kind of hanging out of. Anyways I totally think it's a cop so I pull her in and slam the door. I shit you not this like toddler gets out of the back seat with a helmet on and his dad pulls out his tricycle. I jumped into the front seat butt ass naked and floored it out of there.
 I got caught having sweaty sex in my car by a toddler and his dad. 
So in my group of friends, we have this one friend who isn't really a slut, but like she does stuff sometimes. Anyways at a party I had, she got drunk and went to my one friend. Lets call him friend 1. So she goes to friend 1 and tell him she doesn't want to make any mistakes and it's HIS job to make sure she doesn't do anything sexual to anyone. So friend 1 comes downstairs and tells us all not to do anything with her. Then my other friend, Friend 2, who was also drunk, was like "Youre the ones with your hands all over her! blah blah no one's gonna do anything to her" so friend 1 is like "whatever".
Then she came into the room and in the middle of the night drunk friend 2 ate her out. Turns out she was on her period. It's was pretty funny.
 Drunk male friend ate out other drunk female friend's period blood vagina. 
I fucked my girlfriend from behind in an open door cabin at her family reunion. There were no doors besides the one leading into the cabin from the outside. She jumped into my bed while her parents were in the adjacent room reading and she started to jack me off. She turned around and we were in spoon position. I was horny, she was horny, so she pulled down her pants and I slipped it in. I had my hand over her mouth as I viciously pounded her and came on her mom's handbag. Her parents never discovered a thing. No ragrets.
I fucked my girlfriend in a room with no doors adjacent to her parents room and came on her mom's handbag. 
One night I was having sex with my (then) girlfriend, she was on her period but I dont really care about that, and we were doing all sorts of positions and just going at it really hard. The morning after I wake up with the sunlight in my face, I carefully open my eyes and look around the room. My former bedroom was really small, just big enough to fit a kingsize bed and a night stand in it, so there were three walls on the three sides of the bed. When I looked around I just couldn't speak. The blood was everywhere. On the sheets, on all three walls... It was horrid. I got out of bed, walked into my living room (I was living in an apartment that was apart of my parents house) and I sat down on my couch just trying to apprehend the situation. Then my girlfriend woke up yelling my name, and I just answered "yes, yes i know..." I told her we had to clean it up before my mom came down. Started cleaning but the blood wouldn't come off the walls. My girlfriend then tells my she is late for school (I was a year older than her and had just quit high school), so I drove her to school and when I get back my mom is sitting on my couch. "Son, we need to talk" "Did you and your girlfriend have a an accident last night?" I answered "oh yeah, she had a nosebleed and she sneezed". She looked at me like I was stupid.. I told her to please not tell my dad, and she didn't. When I went into my room to clean it up, it was all gone. The sheets, the walls, all cleaned. 
Haven't talked about it since. 
  Had sex, lots of blood, awkward. 
Okay, well I can comment on something. Well when i was 13 i had been masterbating for like six months at time I did this. Well, I was in woodshop and my friend didn't believe I could produce semen, so i have to prove that i can so i start beating it in the middle of the room in front of 30 kids, one of which was a girl i had a crush on. About 5 minutes later i had a hand covered in semen and no where to put it. Me winning the bet with my friend, I then decide to "dispose of the evidence by wiping it on the bitch of the class sweatshirt she took off and left on her workbench. She never knew what happened besides that it was crusty and thought it was a glue type substance. my buddies and me just laughed our fucking heads off at this.
Sanded my piece in woodshop class and added my varnish to a girl's sweatshirt. 
Well, once when I was 17, I snuck out and rode my bike 9 miles to my gf at the times house because her parents were gone for the night for some reason I can't recall. Something with her grandmother I think. But, it was the dead of winter and around -15° F. rode bike 9 miles in well below freezing temps for pussy.
So there's two 
(Both around age 11)
1) Having a sleepover at a friends house we all stayed downstairs and slept on his couches/floor. As curious 11 year olds the host flicks on babe station and I masturbated on his couch while the other guys was watching the tv.
2) Another time It was just me and another dude (still best buddies). I was sleeping on the top bunk which would have normally been his brothers bed and my friend was on the bottom bunk. I masturbated AGAIN whilst watching adult channels and whilst my friend was awake and occasionally talking to me.
beat the bishop twice whilst in a room with my pals. 
Well, I'm a bit late to the game, but....
When I was fourteen my boyfriend and I were relegated to a church only relationship...both his parents and my mother being bible thumpers, the only times we were allowed to see each other were either in supervised visits to each other's houses, or at church functions.  Well, it was Easter Sunday, and his grandparents had asked us to go to a play at their church.  Understand that this church was the Wal-Mart of churches---it was enormous, and when it put on a production, it was pretty legit.  Well, we were allowed to sit by ourselves--after all, what sort of business could we get into in a church full of people. &gt;.&gt; Wanting to get as far away from his family as we could, we went to the balcony, and low and behold, all the way in the back there's a pew that is entirely empty.  Not believing our luck, we sneak back there, and once the lights have gone down, we lie down on the pew.  So, I'm on top of him, and we're going at it.....now, I had noticed that there was a guy with a camera a bit further up the aisle--this church filmed all of its productions and made a bit of cash selling copies to the parents and family members of the actors.  I hadn't really paid the bloke any attention, however--please note that this was fifteen years ago, back when cameras were twenty pounds and still took vhs.  So when the camera guy backed up and placed his foot on the pew we were laying on to help support the camera, I hadn't seen him coming, and gave my boyfriend a sort of "oh shit" look as I carefully began trying to pull my shirt back on so that we could sneak away before the guy saw us.  Well, it ends up there was a reason that pew was empty.  A couple of seconds after the guy placed his foot on the seat of it, there was a loud cracking sound, and the seat of it gave way.  My boyfriend, myself, and the camera man all fell to the floor, but not before he swung the camera around to see what was happening, catching my boyfriend and I, half undressed with faces full of 'FUCK NO', perfectly with the camcorder.  Needless to say our parents were horrified, and we were both banned from that church.  There was no Easter play available on tape for sale that year.  
* boyfriend and I break a pew, ruin an Easter service, and taint the Easter play video with shennanigans.*
Edit: grammar. 
Thowaway time.
Couple of month ago I tried this "make your own pussy thing". You put flower or corn starch in water, microwave it, then freeze it.
My flour's performance in the microwave was less than optimal, so I froze it for extra long. Parents came home - 
"Wtf is this?"  
"Oh, it's a density thing for science"
"Ok, cool".
Later that night when I went to retrieve it, the thing was damn near frozen, so I put it in the microwave. Started going to town on it, with the stuff going fucking everywhere until I felt this weird sensation when I touched the bottom of the glass with my dick. I literally burnt my dick. It was bad. I have a scab because I'm fucking stupid. It felt like a demon had just gone to town on my or something.
 Homemade fleshlight, burn, ow ow ow, fuck me, right?
P.S. - Don't put hot stuff on your dick. It hurts.
OK so I'm over at my girlfriend's place late at night and we're doing the nasty in her bed, under the covers.  Well, I guess we made too much noise 'cause her dad busted into the room with a gun.  I jumped up out of bed, full of panic and fear.  And my girlfriend just looked white as a ghost and knew she was in deep, deep shit.  So she blurted out "I don't know him!"  Which probably made sense to her teenaged brain at that moment.  So then her father blew my brains out.
:D
got head
Regardless of how good shots they are, They still are retarded soldiers. 
I will play devils advocate here, largely because I have nothing else to do.
&gt;Opening shot of A New Hope shows them taking excellent shots at the Rebel Soldiers. 
They were pretty terrible by real world standards. I think the situation actually says more about how terrible the rebels were than how good stormtroopers were. They had one entry point, exposed hallway and were on the defense. If a squad of say, USMC forces were there, They would set up position at the end of the hallway and locked it down with suppressing fire/grenades etc. The Rebels dont seem to comprehend the idea of automatic fire. Also, breaching and clearing a hallway in that amount of time would be considered sloppy by IRL forces.Part of it was the crappy weapons.
And those same storm troopers can't hit Han when he is outside the Falcon on Tatootine. No orders for them to miss then. 

&gt;Later, Obi-Wan famously says "These blast points... too accurate for Sand People. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise".
Sand People are desert nomads. Being more accurate than them isn't saying much. 
\&gt;BUT MUH EU! THEY WERE ORDERED TO LET THEM ESCAPE THE DEATH STAR!!
They couldn't hit Han at Tatooine, they couldn't hit anyone while they were fighting on endor - Leia got grazed after a shot from 40 meters away managed to hit her. Han and Leia were fully exposed in the doorway of the blast door, and only one single shot managed to hit them, despite their being an entire legion of the empires best troops in the area. 
\&gt;Plot armor
explains missing the heroes, but all the other occasions against nameless opponents? 
I think one conclusion that people are not considering is that everyone in the star wars universe judges good shots by their universes standards. In Star wars, everyone fires off blasters in all directions primarily because it looks cool, not because it makes sense. Stormtroopers are less shit than rebels? The Rebels are pretty terrible too.  
Star wars uses tech that is advanced beyond IRL standards, but is practically backwards. A Laser pointer is more advanced than a battleaxe, but which is better at killing? 
You have these Star wars guns that fire slowly, leave a glowing beam heading back towards your position. On Endor, the Empire had a vital position to defend. Their only objective is to defend it. What do they do? Do they set up multiple layers of defenses, encircling the area? Do they Clear the forest back for miles around to make sure that no one can sneak up on them? When they come under attack, do they secure the immediate area and lock down the entrance?
Nope, they let the jungle grow right up to the bunker, only build one Blast door, and as soon as they are attacked they run into the jungle away from their defensive position. This is the legion of the empires best troops right? right?
Lets look at another large battle we see in star wars. While it doesn't contain storm troopers, or their predecessors, it gives an idea of the tactics in the star wars universe. 
**Gungans vs Droid**
The two armies line up, walk towards each other and engage in a melee fight that would make sense in a medieval fantasy or lord of the rings battle but not in a world with such things as thermal detonators, blaster rifles and such exist. 
**Geonosis**
Two massive armies line up and slowly walk towards each other firing blaster rifles at each other, with tanks, artillery and air support from both sides firing into the masses of infantry that show no interest in cover. 
**Utapau** 
A group of clones rappel down from the high ground so they can hipfire at close range into the droids, despite the fact that they could have done that from the high ground above. 
**every fight vs a jedi ever** 
The Clones/Stormtroopers run towards the warrior with the close range blade of death. watch the fight between Yoda, Obi-wan and the clones outside the temple. The clones sprint towards the jedi, despite having ranged weapons against the jedi's Lightsabers. 

Star Wars Tactics are terrible it seems. I blame the universe: its all about looking visually cool that making tactical/logical sense. The Blasters are mostly semi-auto and the stormtroopers dont snap shot. Watch some breaching videos on youtube of IRL forces, and you see just how efficiently they can clear rooms/corridors. Another critical factor: they are 70/80s sci fi characters. They were born in the age of the redshirt, when "Efficient space empire" was taken slightly less seriously than it is today. 
**** The Stormtroopers are victims of a universe where everything is done by how visually cool it looks, small amounts of plot armor, and 70s standards. 
Edit - I guarantee this will come up several times in the next week. final decision? nope! 
I recall that someone posted their engagement picture where he and his fiance were huddled under an umbrella while someone was out of the picture frame and spinning steel wool (so it was "raining" down on them).  He said it took several takes to get the picture and that the steel wool was burning him when it would hit his skin every so often, but it was more uncomfortable than painful.
  
- Yes, it'll burn, but could be worth it.  
EDIT: I couldn't find that particular photo, but this is a similar [example](    
Don't respect the mixup of your opponent, the timing for a crossup dive kick is super strict, but the timing for a fake crossup dive kick is really "easy", so let's say that 90% of the time, after a softknock down, if the cammy try to dive kick you, even if it hit on your back, it will be fake crossup
Also a good way to make the Cammy player make more mistake is to never quick raise after a soft knockdown
it's easier to time a dive kick crossup after a backthrow but the timing is still really strict (not like yun or rufus)
after soft knockdown, never protect the dive kick crossup until the cammy player show you that he knows how to do it (specially in the corner)
I've never seen this guy ride or the condition of his horses in person, but assuming they are healthy, the only real way he could do harm to his horses by riding in town is by trotting/galloping on hard pavement for extended periods. Riding on pavement is extremely bad for a horse's legs and can lead to lameness, which looks like limping. I've seen countless lame carriage horses trotting around downtown and no one seems to care about that.
Personally, I would never tie my horse up and leave it unattended. Since they are prey animals with a very strong flight instinct, their first reaction to anything "scary" (which can range from a paper bag in the wind to a loud explosion like a car engine backfiring) causes them to want to run away. If they can't break free easily, they usually end up injuring themselves. I've been riding and training horses for twenty years and I've seen horses break their necks trying to get loose. Even the most well-trained, "bomb-proof" horses can react this way. Conversely, if his horse was to spook and get loose, then you have the issue of a loose horse running around a congested urban area.
 Riding around is fine, as long as he's not galloping on the pavement. He's definitely taking a risk by leaving his horses unattended.
We had our 3 year old English Cocker Spaniel spayed yesterday and it's obviously made her very sore, ruined her appetite (which is a big deal for something as voracious as a spaniel!) and made her super clingy.
My husband is 13 years older than me but has never owned a dog of his own, his parents always dealt with the family dogs, so he was really unsure of how to deal with a moping pup. I could tell he was getting distressed by how she was reacting.
I'm sick and disabled so normally he takes over all the important stuff and comforts everyone but all she's wanted to do since we got her home is cuddle me at all times and sleep in my lap. (That alone made me happy, she chose me! Hehe.)
He looks after me like a complete pro no matter how sick I am so I thought he'd be able to handle this too. It seems it was a steep learning curve for him though!
The vet told us to prepare something bland and soft for her to eat, make sure she had plenty to drink and to watch her like a hawk so she wouldn't touch her stitches. 
My husband ended up a little overwhelmed. He didn't know how to properly prepare chicken and rice for a dog to settle her stomach post anaesthetic. He didn't know how to get her to eat it even though she was sleepy and uninterested. He couldn't get her to drink anything to combat the potentially constipating anaesthetic. He didn't know how to stop her from chewing her stitches (long ears + the cone of shame = chaos).
I showed him how to boil chicken breasts, cool the resulting stock, skim the fat and then cook the rice in it. When she refused to even touch her carefully prepared dinner, he gave up and asked if we should call the vet.
I said no and instead took a banana, mashed it up, lifted her lip and gently pushed it through her teeth and onto her tongue (the sweetness stimulated her appetite and she eventually took a piece without me forcing it on her). 
Once I'd got her to eat a small amount of banana, I then hand fed her some of the chicken and rice until she was too tired to continue. 
She was still refusing to drink though at that point and my husband's many attempts at coaxing her just made her (and him) extremely irritated. I got her interested in drinking again by giving her my lactose-free milk :) I dipped my fingers in it and rubbed it on her gums and before I knew it, she was lapping it up! :)
He was also battling to stop her licking or chewing her stitches without a buster collar. If you turned your head for a second, she went for them. I sent him out to get some 2-3 year old (human size) onesie pjs, then we cut the arms and legs off and put it on her backwards (poppers on her back) so her tail could fit out the back by leaving a popper undone. That way, she can't get to her stitches and we don't have to watch her so closely.
I ended up sleeping on the sofa with her all night (she usually sleeps at the bottom of our bed but I didn't want her to be kicked accidentally in the night). Overnight I managed to get her to eat a few noodles cooked in chicken stock and drink some water with a tiny drop of juice in it to tempt her.
When he got up this morning he was amazed to find that she was doing really well and had eaten *and* had a drink.
She's still very clingy and has to be touching me at all times for reassurance but I'm stupidly proud of myself for being able to help my dog feel so much better when I need 24/7 care myself.
I know it probably seems like a really stupid and small thing to be proud of but I'm so glad I can still be useful, even if only to help my beautiful companion recover :D
**- I'm extremely sick and disabled, need 24 hour care but I was able to look after my dog after she had surgery when my much older husband had no idea what to do to help her. Small thing but it made me happy!**
More than just practically, I'd say D: You can't collect cheese on at least 90% of the maps, on your own, unless you know how to walljump on chocolate and wood.  This isn't even to mention all the other tricks, such as corner jumping, chocolate turn arounds, wood turn arounds and wall pushes, that are all required if you actually want to get any firsts at all.  Gameplay is fairly complicated with a very high learning curve, which means weeks of playing before you can even comfortably walljump against the edge of a platform without falling off.  
Transformice can be played easily enough, but to actually be anything more than a noob requires months of practice.
Within Christian mythology it's a huge shift in direction, you are absolutely correct. However, the reason for the shift in direction I believe has much to do with Judaism losing power/influence while that region was occupied by the Roman Empire. The old testament writings for the most part were about a nation of people who had many successful war campaigns and conquered a decent amount of land. It also talks about the exploits of mighty kings who had Yahweh, the war god of Judea and Israel, at their side. All in all the Old Testament is about a nation of people who had the power of the god of gods supporting them.
During the reign of the Roman Empire, Israel was not the mighty nation it had once been. Many Jews would have been a lower class and therefore much poorer/powerless, than their Roman counterparts. It could have been possible that a few people within Judaism, began a new movement, or perhaps multiple movements that preached salvation for the meek and oppressed, rather than beating the war drums or sounding the horns of triumph as was seen in the old testament. 
The New Testament has an overlying theme of hope for the weak. The Jesus figure was not a powerful king by earthly standards; he was just a handyman by trade. He was a figured who recognized his lowly position in society, as well as, the position most of his followers in that society. He preached patience, non-violence, forgiveness of your transgressors/oppressors, and that those who lived a good life loving God and being satisfied with what they had, would find salvation and happiness after death.
If you look at the history of that area of the world, in particular the history of the Hebrew people in that part of the world, you see a nation that was once a powerful force, but had their power stripped from them twice. Once by the Babylonians and once by Rome. The Old Testament and New Testament, aside from being fairly historically inaccurate(wrong dates, wrong leaders,etc), do for the most part reflect the time when they were supposed to have been written.
Admittedly, some of this is my own speculation. However, it is not unreasonable for the history of those people to be reflected in their holy books. Many other religious mythologies do the same thing.
*** The history of the Hebrew people was most likely a major factor responsible for the change in attitude from the Old Testament to the New Testament.
As someone who was fat when they joined the military, this stinks worse than a pile of shit (as we all know).  I practically starved myself in the month after high school leading up to basic.  
I was about 200-210ish pounds, down from 220 pounds.  My stomach has shrunk so much that I could not physically ingest enough calories to meet how much I was burning.  It physically hurt.  I was starving pretty much after two hours following a meal.  It took a couple weeks for my stomach to expand to what was necessary to not be starving all of the time.  Even then, I was still losing weight.
I was in Navy basic training, which isn't really well known for being very physically strenuous.  My exercise consisted of mostly moderate PT and formation marching.  We marched 2 miles roundtrip for each meal, for a total of 6 miles per day.  That isn't including all of the other marching to other events.  I was probably eating at least 4000 calories per day, and I practically gorged myself at each meal.  They had no problems with you eating how ever much you wanted, unless you were fat and continuing to be fat.  You're going to use that energy, and they see to it that you do.  I was 180 pounds after boot camp.  Unfortunately, I hadn't gained much muscle.  What I did gain was endurance.  The muscle came later in A school, where my body had time to repair and I could actually work on strength building exercises.
I was always subject to the rope and choke for body fat percentage, as I have always been a bit stockier.  I always passed, because we all know that BMI on an individual scale is a pretty poor representation of a person (great for a population though).
  at less than 1000 calories per day, that commenter would, at best, end up in the hospital.  Either they are lying about what they ate, or they were so fucking lazy that they were kicked out of basic.
Accidental Intravenous injection of ephedrine hydro chloride by my dentist. I have asthmatic Bronchitis and kind of "grew" over it. No allergies what so ever and I had no reaction ....but the day after ho-ly-shit. Felt like I was dying for months. Blood tests everything turned out perfect but still felt like shit for a long time. Feeling great now but people can die from an intravenous injection.. Can result in cardiac arrest when you have asthma. Bodies are weird. 
: Almost got killed by my dentist 
&gt;I think getting a conversation going and reenforcing the notion that tokophobia is not a female exclusive issue has a lot of value and would love to get other's perspectives
I love this entire post, but especially that part. So many issues, definitely not limited to tokophobia, are treated as gender-specific, when really, they're just human issues. Tokophobia, CF lifestyle, family lifestyle, sexual and/or physical abuse, reproductive rights (abortion, essure/vasectomy)...We could go on. 
They are not simply "women's issues" or "men's issues" they are OUR issues, as a species overall. It's not all kittens and roses, but there are obviously active measures we can take against tokophobia without cutting ourselves out of good relationships. First of all, being open and honest about your fears/needs, hormonal BC, surgical procedures, etc. 
As a female tokophobic, I have taken EC pills after protected (with condom) intercourse, in which the prophylactic didn't even fail. I've done that on two separate occasions. As much as I enjoy sex, after having it, I spend the next few weeks in agony waiting on my period. Ironically (and cruelly), stress can cause delays in menstruation. Who knows how much money I've wasted on negative at-home pregnancy tests. But, I'm under 30, no previous kids, no insurance, sooooo I just kind of have to deal with it. 
Luckily, most people in my life are supportive of my CF choice. Although as a female, who is super freaked over the notion of being pregnant, it does suck when friends poke "haaa, maybe you're pregnant?!" jokes. I mention to someone I'm feeling nauseous, my period seems a little late, I'm sore, etc...I can't believe how many times I've heard "maybe you're pregnant!" 
Most of the time I laugh and say "HA! INCORRECT! Someone has to have sex with you before you get pregnant!" But sometimes when I hear that, it's more like "Holy shit...maybe I'm pregnant. Oh my god I AM PREGNANT. Noooooooooooo!!!" and that's when I run out and buy another pregnancy test that is going to turn out negative, and I also convince myself that I somehow peed on it wrong, or my hormones are lying, and I AM pregnant, and then just wait in agony until my period starts. 
Then I remember that horrible day my mother told me she still had her period for the first four months she was pregnant with me, so don't always trust that as an indication that you're safe.
*** I constantly worry that I am pregnant, even though it's almost impossible. Tokophobes unite! I appreciate your post, OP!
I  had similar issues with them, over heating and bsod-ing laptop, paid for 3 year full return warranty, had the issue three months after purchase and they told me because I was in Ireland they wouldn't cover shipping. Now, my fault I missed it in the terms, but when all the warranty gave me was that I wouldn't have to pay for shipping costs on returns it was a bit unfair. I basically paid extra for no benefit, which they easily could've told me when I purchased as they clearly knew from my shipping address the warranty wouldn't be valid.
So I paid and had it shipped to them; a few days after they receive it I get an email claiming that the ssd i put into the laptop was the reason for the problems and they were charging me to post the laptop back to me.
I'd looked at the bsod logs and knew it was GPU related. So I pleaded, told them it makes no sense technically for it to overheat and bsod because of an ssd. After a day or two the laptop  was looked at for repair again thankfully, I was put in contact directly with the guy who was fixing it. In fairness, I told him a bunch of games it bsods with and he got his steam collection and ran some games on it until it crashed. He then apologised and said that the problem was I'm fact the GPU and that the main board and the GPU needed to be replaced. Repaired under the warranty and then sent back to me.
The worrying part it, had I not pushed them to look at the problem again, they would've sent it back to me still not repaired and charged me for it. I'm lucky I know my stuff technology wise, but the average buyer on there couldve  been screwed.
they tried to avoid repairing my laptop because I'd put in my own ssd.
If they wanted tourist dollars, they should do a better job of keeping the bikes stocked in touristy areas- unfortunately most of them are in midtown manhattan. Even if they were there, it would be damn intimidating for someone used to the suburbs to get on a bike and start riding around manhattan. 
A ride through central park would be a LOT more palatable, but the system doesn't extend that far. Also, the 30 minute limit doesn't really help in that regard either, its kind of short to take a leisurely stroll through unfamiliar streets. 
TL, DR: if you want tourists, make the day passes more attractive to tourists. 
Swedish Mason here. Can confirm. The Norwegian GL (DNFO) practices the Swedish Rite which requires a Christian confession.
That being said, nobody will judge your level of religiosity. As long as you are willing to self-identify as a Christian, the definition of what you actually mean with that is up to you and your own conscience. The question will be put to you, during the initiation. I've heard candidates getting away with as vague statements as "I sympathize with the Christian values" and thus dodging the question completely. I can not guarantee that will always work of course.
Personally I see the requirement for christian confession as our greatest threat for recruitment and relevance in the future. Unfortunately (again, my opinion) the GL policymakers belong to a very different generation and consider it a strength.
So without knowing anything about you I'd definitely recommend you to join. That is if you think you can live with the christian slant. I think we have a great thing going here, and sooner or later the matter of religiosity needs to be addressed. 
 Yes
I saw your comment on the thread which said you want to focus on the misuse of TWs rather than the fact that people mock TWs... which is good, because I don't think we should ever argue for stopping using something because someone is mocking it... but I don't quite know why the misuse matters. 
This isn't like the word "rape" being used to describe things that aren't rape - or is it? Is that the argument? If so then I completely understand and support that. TWs should not be used when you only mean it metaphorically. I totally agree it should only ever be used in a literal sense. 
But it also seems like a large part of the argument is that people use it - and not metaphorically but literally - for things that are too nonserious and things that don't/shouldn't trigger anyone. I saw, for instance, the example of TW for the word "bitch" used in the content as a nonserious TW which cheapens the usage of TWs. I don't like this, because it gets us into the terriroty of deciding what is allowed to trigger whom, and I am not convinced that using TWs for something we consider mildly offensive causes any harm. 
I'd like to inject a personal anecdote into all this dry theory. I've never been great at knowing myself, tracking my emotions, knowing that I am angry or sad when I am angry or sad. I was just never taught to pay attention to these things, because the culture I come from isn't a very individualisti culture, individual feelings and emotions just aren't valued much. I also deeply internalized both the sexist idea that women shouldn't show anger AND the more modern/western idea that "cool" women (the type that hang out with dudes and are cool with everything) don't get ruffled or personally offended ever. Because of this, noticing and naming and owning my feelings about things or conversations or people is relatively new to me, as new as serious feminism is. 

So I don't know if the way I feel sometimes when I see certain topics being discussed a certain way can be called triggered. I feel like a phony when I say I was triggered, because no professional has diagnosed me. 
And yet. Trigger warnings have been IMMENSELY useful to me to steer clear of certain topics. Just last week, I saw a trigger warning for domestic abuse  and noped out of the thread without clicking on the link. I went back later when I felt more prepared and I am so. freaking. glad. The TW really saved my whole day, if I had clicked on the link unknowingly I'd have gone the whole day feeling ever so slightly out-of-control of my emotions and ashamed of myself for feeling that way and blah blah blah. 
**So is,**  I personally love TWs, and I'd like to see discussion of how exactly using TWs for mildly offensive things is harmful before we can make a compelling argument to draw lines around when it's okay to use TWs or whether we should get rid of it altogether. 

For those who don't know, the story so far:
* Feb 22nd - March 21st: A petition identical in its wording to this one was created, but only gained momentum toward the last couple of days. It got 64,000+ signatures.

 Read it and sign it! Tell your friends! We can do it this time, folks!
[EDIT:] over 48,000 signatures, keep 'em coming!
Dude, let me tell you a little story of my own to that I hope will give you some perspective on what a good position you're actually in.
So last May I started talking to this girl on OkCupid.  We were a 93% match, but after a string of shitty first (and only) dates, I was extremely close to throwing in the towel.  This girl was different though.  She was gorgeous, she was intelligent, and she was engaging.  I wanted to meet up within a few messages, but she was going to Puerto Rico for a week, so we had to put the meeting off.  The whole week she was in Puerto Rico, she's still texting me.  Not just a message or two each day either.  All day, every day.  Frankly, it was great.  We kept an engaging conversation going for over a week, and everything was peachy.  
When she got back home, we decided to meet up.  We decide to go to this little tapas bar, and everything seemed perfect.  She was half Lebonese, and I had picked a restaurant named for a Lebonese dish!  We connected on levels we weren't even aware of!  Both of us were amazed at how compatible we already were without ever having met! Or so I thought.  She starts getting nervous the night before, and texts asking me if I'm nervous and hoping I won't be disappointed, etc.  How could I be disappointed?!  This girl was everything I was hoping to find!
Fast forward to the date.  I see her walking up, and she is exactly what I had imagined.  Gorgeous doesn't begin to describe her.  Just breathtaking.  We say hi to each other, and usually I go in for a hug when I meet a date for the first time.  She turns quickly toward the bar and walks inside.  "No big deal, I'll just make that mental connection," I thought.  
During the date, everything starts going wrong.  The conversation was awkward and felt forced.  I get so nervous that I'm going to blow it, I went to the restroom to calm myself down.  I couldn't piece it together.  How could this date be going this badly?  It felt so perfect before.  What was happening?!?!?!
After we eat, I ask her to go for a walk by the water.  She agrees, but comments about how she hates walking.  Then she makes a few remarks about how she thinks I'm a serial killer and this is my plot to kill her.  Truth is, the walk on the waterfront is my move.  I have a whole spiel about the harbor bridge and how I always wanted to design bridges.  All the while the walk is romantic, there are some swings on the pier where couples will often snuggle up, and the view of the harbor is beautiful.  Nobody hates it.  Except her.  She hates that I made her walk all of half a block to talk about what makes me tick.  So I shift the conversation to be about her.  And even then she wasn't having any of it.  At this point, I had lost all hope.  This perfect person that I had found was a total flop.  So I walk her back to her car, thinking that would be the end of it, but no.  When we get to her car, she asks me out on a second date!  I was immensely confused, but I wanted to give it a second chance because I couldn't have been *that* wrong, could I?
I could, and was.  The second date was even more painful, but the conversation in between was once again incredibly engaging.  We couldn't stop talking to each other when we were apart, but when we were together nothing felt right.  I wanted so badly to chock it up to her just being awkward, but that wasn't it.  I finally got the guts to ask her how she felt.  She told me she just wasn't physically attracted to me, and nothing was ever going to happen between us.  My heart sank right through the floor.  I ended up wasting close to a month of my life on this girl who I was crazy about, but she was never really even interested in me.  
So it's way better for you to be told up front that she's not interested than to have it drag out and waste your time.  It may sting now, but that'll go away pretty quick.  It's nothing like the slow burn.
Well right now i'm in the middle of AFFC.  But I do believe the second half of ASOS was a climax point in the series (so far).  The first two books, while grand, were definitely building up to the huge storm in the third book.  Right now, I feel like AFFC is kind've a cool down.  I'm not sure about ADWD yet since i'm not even there yet.
I do recall Martin saying that he was originally going to write just three books.  (Game of Thrones, Dance with Dragons, Winds of Winter).  So the first three would've been AGOT, while the next two would probably be A Dance with Dragons.  So the next climax probably won't happen until the end of ADWD.


 series climaxed towards end of ASOS.  Next one probably won't come until end of ADWD (i'm half way through AFFC)
You *don't * think cops follow the blue code? Get real, kid.

This one guy tried to go against the blue code. The rot goes all the way to the top.
"Adrian Schoolcraft (born 1976) is a former New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer who secretly recorded police conversations from 2008 to 2009. He brought these tapes to NYPD investigators in October 2009 as evidence of corruption and wrongdoing within the department. He used the tapes as evidence that arrest quotas were leading to police abuses such as wrongful arrests, while the emphasis of fighting crime sometimes resulted in underreporting of crimes to keep the numbers down.
After voicing his concerns, Schoolcraft was reportedly harassed and reassigned to a desk job. After he left work early one day, an ESU unit illegally entered his apartment, physically abducted him and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric facility, where he was held against his will for six days.[1] In 2010, he released the audio recordings to The Village Voice, leading to the reporting of a multi-part series titled The NYPD Tapes. That same year he filed a lawsuit against the NYPD and Jamaica Hospital. In 2012 The Village Voice reported that a 2010 unpublished report of an internal NYPD investigation found the 81st precinct had evidence of quotas and underreporting."
I still have the arrest record citing felony assault on officer along with a slew of bullshit, along with the prosecutor's deal to change it to a single misdemeanor of disturbing the peace after they found out I had a written testimony and witness.
Go fuck yourself, moron.
We'll see a lot of people doing absolutely stupid stuff in the slim chance they'll get their 15 minutes of fame. There will be less emphasis on creating new and innovative content, and more on regurgitating someone else's work. People won't take responsibility for themselves, and will only care about subjects that are popularized. I don't see any of these things changing as they grow older.
 They'll suck.
yes, do more research before you make your next purchase. with the exception of the pinnacle (which isn't really considered a vape pen, really.) no pen style vaporizers vape herb. they surely will claim they do, but none actually do. they all just combust it. pens are made for oil and for oil glycerine tinctures, their shape and such makes actual vaporization of herbs pretty much impossible, but you probably didn't blow too much on it because pens are cheap, so save your lunch money and buy an arizer solo from gotvape.com for $140 when you can, and you'll never look back.


it doesn't vaporize herbs and it wont
I'd like to add that there is also no evidence that it doesn't interfere with it. I think this is a good example. Think of a body of water with 2 waves of different heights. They will hit each other and can create a different height. the they revert to their original hight.  In theory it could interfere.  
Also once your above 5000 feet you go out of your cell phone range.  So it's just going to kill your battery. 
 
Also there may be other electronics that could interfere with navigational equipment.  If we do get rid of the law and a plane goes down because of it. 100 people are dead and the airlines gonna be owing people a lot of money. 
How do you distinguish from different devices other then cell phones.  You now have to train everybody to look for them. Do you create a device to look for those signals? Longer lines getting through TSA
I guess these are extreme but a lot if lives are on the line. 
Tldr. Why pass something thy could increase costs.  And if it ain't broke don't fix it. 

It's probably important to ask why 2 people would want to quit at a time that maximizes screwing over their employer. Clearly there is something wrong that needs to be addressed or you'll just end up with more people quitting in such a manner. 
I remember one of my first dish jobs was at a busy mid-range restaurant with 3 floors and only 2 dishwashers on duty. One of them was named "Crazy Kevin" because he was a 40 something year old who was legitimately insane, in fact so insane it was mandated that one weekend a month he had to go on "vacation" for mental evaluation (sometimes he wouldn't come back for weeks). My first night there I get trained by Kevin, I'm freshly turned 14 mind you and this is my second dish job (this is a much bigger restaurant). So we're slammed and Kevin can't train anyone, he's insane and even worse.. slow. Buckets of silverware, dishes everywhere and he's spending 20 minutes scrubbing one pan while we get screamed at, I want a cigarette so bad. Service ends around 11 pm and it takes until 1 to finish the dishes. Oh but we're not done yet! Time to mop, the kitchen is pretty huge so even on a great night it takes about 30 minutes to sweep and mop. Kevin is "showing me what to do" and drags out a raggedy garden hose which he attaches to the back sink. He uses it the wet the floor (we have multiple mop buckets) it leaks all over and he takes forever to finish his sections. It's round 2 and he's done but he's stretched out the hose and he's trying to squeeze the water out of it. About 30 minutes later he realizes it's still attached to the sink and there is a slight amount of water going through it. Finally it's about 3 am and his stupid hose is away and we're done. The next night I work with my friend on dish and he's like "never, ever listen to Kevin, he's a retard" and he tells me about Kevin. That night we jammed the fuck out and got out before midnight. 
 worked with a guy who spent til 3 AM squeezing water out of a running hose.
This is Dr Farr at Texas State University. He's a badass dude. Oh yeah, he puts a frog in a blender on the first day of class. 
Edit: a couple people asked so I'll explain further. 
Dr. Farr is a master of suspense and timing, although you'd never know it to look at him. He's also a brilliant educator. On the first day of class, he wants you to learn some bio, sure, but what he really wants is for you to "find your voice". So he pulls out some plant (which i knew the genus and species now) and he asked the students if the plant is alive. The students reluctantly speak up, a few of them murmer "yea.. duh.." (more or less). 
He then up-roots the plant. "Is the plant still alive?" Again, the students kinda give him the affirmative. Then he rips the plant apart into tiny pieces. Now the class isn't so sure. No one is willing to say yes, but the class is beginning to get into this little exercise. Lots more excited murmuring at this point. He walks over to the blender he has set up and blends the shit out of this plant. Its plant soup now. 
"Is the plant still alive?" 
The class gives a collective "No" to which Dr. Farr informs us that, in fact, there are still plant cells which are alive and totally fine. They are still undergoing mitosis and reproduction. The plant is technically still alive. Furthermore, the plant could be cloned at this stage, effectively "keeping it alive". 
After the class agrees that the plant is still alive, Dr. Farr pulls out his next demonstration. He pulls out a healthy, completely live frog. (once again, i wish i could tell you the genus and species, because he makes it a point to tell a little about each organism before he blends it). The class is already getting uneasy. He began the discussion about the plant in the exact same manner. Is he going to blend this frog like he blended the plant?? He tells us about how this species of frog is the only one to have these specific claws and to do this or that or etc. 
He then starts to walk over to the blender, and the first whimper from some sorority girl is heard as the rest of the class begins to fall silent. As i said, he is a master of suspense. He plays the old man card and he knows that everyone expects him to do something stupid and old-man-like. He raises the frog up to the blender and the silence is broken. People begin to freak out a bit.
"But, you said that the plant was still alive, even after i blended it! What's different about this frog??" 
He's raising the frog closer and closer to the blender and the class is getting louder and louder. More and more uneasy. 
PLOP! 
The class erupts, all the girls are screaming for him not to blend this frog, and all the frat guys are cheering him on in a primal fashion (maybe this reaction was supposed to be our first taste of observational biology). Dr. Farr's finger hovers above the blend button as he seemingly decides whether or not to blend this frog. He lets the class freak out for a good minute or two... and then he takes the frog out. He didn't blend the frog. Happy or sad or anticlimactic, you decide!  

Science is a cruel mistress, but if you love her just right, she gives the best blowjobs. 
Ummmm.....
The bachelor level is completely inadequate to even begin addressing the technological problems we run in to today in molecular fields (everything important, computers are fast now and we are now wondering what to do with them... raw computational engineering has far surpassed our ability to use it for valuable purposes). Before a decade of study, you haven't run in to the heuristics (tried-and-true practices) and situational learning required to perform relevant experiments that examine interesting, usually interfacial questions as most are today. Even professors who have not embraced -omics approaches or minimally some systems thinking, are being run out by younger people who can. ie today, half of our academic 'leaders' are doing irrelevant, unnecessary work that can be overcome en masse with better defined experiments containing more thoughtful metrics, with higher throughput nonetheless and better quantitation of assumptions, errors, and noise sources. 
More people need PhDs (and proper training! not happening really in these crap labs I speak of, sadly) so they are, at least, less confused about what a waste of time and money these inadequately trained people are. Not to mention that these outdated opinions still hold tremendous sway as -omics and computational modeling are just becoming accepted as a bare minimum standard for relevant experiments. 
 our educational system (broadly), and the people it produces, are not good enough to address real problems in the real world.
I haven't rekindled an old pre-transition flame, but the reasons for transitioning (and realizing why I have such little self-respect) are the *exact same reasons* you had. Anyone who showed me even the slightest glimmer of hope had me obsessing over them.
Now that I'm in a committed relationship, my hatred for myself just snowballed. My dysphoria became ridiculous, almost to the point of breaking my relationship up. Now, I'm at the point of how in the world I'm going to transition.
Point is - I rambled a bit just now too. We all need to ramble. Let it all out.
Don't bottle it up inside. Don't let those thoughts of self-harm come close to fruition. Stay strong. Stay alive. Stay *beautiful*.
*** Don't hide a single damned thing from her. She'll respect you so much for it. Coming out to her, telling her your most inner secrets will be the most "man up" thing you can do. Then let her decide what that means for her.
If it means a relationship, *that's awesome*. If not, *that's cool too*.
Not sure if this ramble comment helped. If it did, I'm glad :) Smile!!
The government can provide indirect support for job creation, but most jobs are created by the market (entrepreneurs, corporations, etc). That is why companies like Apple are able to get away with not paying taxes. 
Every government is trying to woo such companies to set up shop in their region so as to provide the jobs that people need. If California won't give Apple the tax breaks it deserves, Ireland will. Sure, the government loses out on corporate taxes. But at least its people have jobs, and that's critical.
 Governments don't create most jobs. That's why companies can "blackmail" governments into giving them huge tax breaks. People may be pissed about this, but the alternative is companies re-locating elsewhere. And there's always someone somewhere who is desperate enough to create jobs in their region who will offer a sweeter tax deal.
Didn't he recently (as in, the last two years) come out saying that he would like to own an NFL team? Problem is, either the NBA or the NFL (forget which) has rules about owning sports teams in different cities. So, he is unable to purchase an NFL team unless he moves the Mavs, or buys the cowboys. I don't think either is likely. 
I don't think the NFL will implode anytime soon, but it will have to make minor changes as TV becomes more important to some than attending games. I think Mark Cuban has some half truths in there, but there's some bitterness in there was well. I think the whole "people will get sick of the NFL being on TV constantly" argument is kinda bullshit. The offseason re-generates that hype every year, not to mention baseball/basketball is on every night of the week sometimes. 
*** Cuban is bitterly spitting out half truths and the NFL will adapt to ~~make more money~~ keep the game alive. 
He's essentially saying that the NFL will have its own "XFL incident" internally. Instead of spreading football out into the offseason, they will spread it out over the week - and possibly lose viewership. 
The Cuban Missile Crisis has a point. 
First off, if you play games on Saturday you will lose viewers. Bar none, there are people who will watch college football, whereas they might have watched if not for the conflict.
Secondly, the more games you play on Thursday, the more viewership you put at risk for losing on Sunday. Some fans just want to watch a lot football - but for a big group of people, it's about watching one team. If you spread your games out through the week, you've got people that will still only watch on one day. All of a sudden your Sunday hits are dropping, because people aren't sticking around to watch other games - they already watched on Thursday.
Third - this isn't the Premiere League. We don't walk the streets for our clubs, ready to smash the flower pots of our Eagle-supporting neighbors. The NFL fanbase is all about the comfort of being a fan. What the hell do I mean by this? I mean that most of us do what we fucking want; we don't wake up at 6 am to watch Champions League games. If anything, the NFL is like an escape from the other stuff - it's not another thing on the list of high priorities. That may not apply to a lot of people on r/nfl, but it does apply to most of the fanbase overall. If you put a game on a weekday night, people will watch it if it is convenient. 
 Mark makes a good point (granted maybe out of being jelly) that the NFL thinks too highly of the good it is selling. Football is a great escape for many fans, but putting it on every night of the week makes it less of an escape and more of a duty to watch, which we fans will say fuck off to.
I was the previous owner of this goldfish. This is one evil bastard. He looks like an evil genius and he is. I had an entire tank full of fish before I bought this bastard, when I sold him, I had none. I saw him push my favorite fish into my filter, which instantly turned him to pulp. He ate most of my smaller fish and would bully my snails by knocking them off the glass. He really was one evil son of a bitch.

Worst ever.
It is not surprising that none of the believers in this thread would even take my olive branch and agree that the "microaggression" theory could possibly be abused. I guess all cases must be 100% true! :P
If one can't admit your "science" can be abused by charlatans, you're full of shit. Even basic math can be abused! 
The possibility of being abused just may be one of the "proofs" that you're dealing with an honest science rather than woo. Science has definitions that can be twisted, and can be made wrong. In woo nothing is wrong! Nobody who believes is wrong! 
Seems like with microaggression theory believers, nobody is wrong! That says something. 
edit  If microaggression theory is not falsifiable, it is not science.
That's my entire point. I would bet they *haven't* done any of that for Daedric armor, or any item in the game short of maybe the standard "I am Dragonborn" Iron helm, with the horns. They cannot selectively enforce a copyright, or they are the ones breaking the law. If OP sold this and they went after him, it sets a staggering precedent for what they would be *required by law* to also go after in the future. Every replica steel breast plate, every replica soul gem, every dragon someone makes that looks vaguely like Alduin, every scroll that looks like an elder scroll, everything in the game, period. They would be completely unwilling to open themselves up to such a ridiculous mess. A court would rule in their favor, you're right. However, the ruling would something vague like "all replicas of in-game items are under the same protection as the game itself", which would set the precedent of them needing to go to court over any replica of an in-game item, or they risk losing the copyright for only protecting it selectively. They would never do that, because it would cost them a hell of a lot more than OP would ever get for this.
 Copyright law is convoluted and complicated. You acting like it's clear cut and simple is laughable.
YES. I live in the inner city and people do this ALL the time. Instead of using what we call "sidewalks" they decide to walk on the road towards oncoming traffic. Now I just speed up like I'm going to run them over just enough so they will put their damn foot on the curb where the pedestrians belong! I wonder what it is about sidewalks these people don't like?
 I'm a passive-aggresive driver. Use a sidewalk please.
I've done it three times, I'll give you an honest assessment of the hike rather than others. 
Danger: The hike IS sketchy and you CAN die on it but you'd have to be stupid to die or hurt yourself on it. The entire hike from base to summit is a metal stairway with rails on each side. There are parts where it gets steep and one or two parts where it literally is a ladder. But you'd have to hop over the railings to fall to the sides. You can fall down but you'd be falling within the railing. You'd still probably die if you did fall depending on how steep it is where you fall, but there are a lot more common hikes that are significantly more dangerous than this one.
Ease: It's not an easy hike. It's nearly 4000 stairs and if you aren't in shape you will not make it. Although this entirely depends on the person. If you're active and hike frequently you'll be fine, if you don't, you will NOT make it. I've hiked Stairway with people who were struggling hard, I've hiked stairway with a chick who looked in shape who couldn't make it past the first of 5 platforms (and actually threw up twice on the way up), but I've also hiked it with my friends girlfriend who did the entire hike up and back with a sprained ankle (which she got playing soccer a few days before the hike). If you're in shape and are active you can do it. If not, you can't, and you shouldn't contemplate doing it. 
Getting caught: All 3 times I've done it the guard was at the bottom when we came down. I just say "hey man how's it going!" and whoever it is has always been like "good man! you? The exit is that way *points*". I came out once and walked back through the woods towards one of the fences you have to either hop or crawl through to get into/out of it and was greeted by two cop cars. The cops did not cite us, just basically told us to leave and not do it again. I think the only reason they were there at that time was because some dipshit cut down the barbed wire and they were trying to figure out who vandalized the fence. 

Doing the hike: I've heard that there's a chance the guard isn't there in the afternoon but I don't know, I've always got there before 3am. BE QUIET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Do NOT talk, do NOT make noise, be QUIET. You DO have to hop a barbed wire fence and you CAN get cut. Then you walk through a dark path and/or the woods before getting to the start of the hike. Things you need: gloves (workout or baseball gloves for gripping the rails. It gets wet/misty and the rails are smooth metal so they're slippery), water, snacks, a towel or two, a hoodie/jacket, at least one flashlight (preferably a headlamp so you can use both arms to grip the railings). You can get workout gloves at walmart for $8 and a headlamp for like $10 at walmart as well. I say to wear a t shirt or tank top or just go shirtless and bring a hoodie/jacket (because it's hot as fk at the bottom), but then you sweat and as soon as you pass the treeline it will get extremely cold so you need a hoodie or jacket at that point. Not exaggerating. I come from the northeast so I know what cold is and it does get cold once you get like 1000ft up, especially at night. 
Also if you are huge/fat/wide/obese you won't be able to do the hike because the railing clearance is skinny. The entire hike is single file and obese people literally cannot fit between the railings in the staircase. Also also there are 5 platforms where you can rest, take breaks, eat snacks, etc. Do not rest on the actual staircase unless it's an emergency because no one is going to wait for you and they're either going to force you to step over the side of the railing to pass you or they're going to step over the side to pass you and that is extremely dangerous (yet people still do it because they're imbeciles). 

- as of last calendar year I have never been cited in the 3 times I've done it. Yes it's somewhat dangerous but if you are competent/not-retarded you'll be fine. 
Last summer I was at a community event at a park, and I noticed a little boy crying to himself off to the side.  I will fully admit I felt a tinge of "don't get involved, it'll be creepy", but I did anyways, and went over and asked him if he was lost.
Sure enough, he was.  I called my wife over to stay with him, looked at him to construct a rough description of him, and looked around to see if any adults looked like they were searching.
Finally I found a guy looking around, becoming increasingly worried.  I asked him if he was looking for someone.  He said yes, his son.  Again, I felt another twinge of "this guy could be a predator", and I asked him to describe him for me.  His description matched the little boy.
So I pulled him over to the where my wife and the little boy were hanging out, and I watched intently to see the little boy's reaction.  He relaxed visibly when he saw his father, and began to cry out of relief.  The father thanked me, and then went off with his son.
Even then I still felt the need to watch them as they walked off.  
I was cognizant of what I was doing the entire time, and while I felt a little bad for having that much doubt about the guy, there are some bad guys out there, and I think it's right to be cautious.
That being said, I think if you're a man and you come across a situation like this, be cautious and careful, but also be brave enough to do the right thing.  I got my wife involved because she was right there with me, so I was lucky in that regard.  But I still think it's our responsibility as human beings (not just men) to look after those in need and in trouble.
 I completely understand the hesitation, but would encourage people to be brave and help a person out in need.

I have been using Armor Etch for 10 years off and on.  They have some time to leave the acid on stated on the label as 5 or 10 minutes.  This is so that the glass does not become overly weakened, and their Corporate Attorneys sleep well at night.
My last project was to etch a wine bottle with a butterfly for my girlfriend.  I ran the 'burn time" at 30 minutes.  Label recommendations are just too light for me.  That said, I filled that project with cold olive oil-structural strength is not an issue. 

If you violate the label recommendations, you WILL get a deeper etching, but realize that it may weaken the glass.  
My first real electric guitar was an Epiphone Sheraton II, and god almighty is it one powerhouse of a guitar. It's semi-hollow, the neck plays like butter and despite it's fragile figure it can take one hell of a beating. It's easy to maintain, is aesthetically pleasing and can (in my opinion) sometimes outshine a 335 if you put the right pickups in it. I've played 2500 Gretschs and Gibson semi's and full hollow bodies but this one just has that sort of flair. The Lucille I've never really had much experience with but I've played a couple of Casinos - they don't really flight my fancy all too much. 
 If you want a great sounding archtop for a reasonable price, get a Sheraton.
I have a Casino, another full hollowbody Gretsch electromatic 5120, and semi hollow Gibson ES-137.  So I can compare these, I've been thinking about a 339 for a while, but as of yet, only have experience with the one semi.
That being said, yes... the casino will feedback more.  I tend to have some dirt in my amp, an OD, then sometimes add a fuzz or distortion to that.  I can't be near the amp with my casino when I go 3 deep with the dirt but this is also only playing at bedroom volumes (AC15 not turned up more than 1/3 of the way up).
The P90's are unlike anything else I have.  I have lots of single coil Fenders and humbucking Gibson's and the P90's are, even though single coil, more like humbuckers in their sound and output.  The pickups have pretty hight output but it is a very quiet guitar, noisewise (I think this is due to the pickup selection switch being closer to where all the wiring is).  The other two have pickup selectors above the pickups so the wiring has to run from the pickups, to the controls, then back up to the selector switch, then back down to the output jack. That's a lot of wiring that is eliminated in the Casino since the switch is right there by the controls.  The dot and 335/339 type guitars do the same thing as the casino here.
The semi hollow es-137 is a much fatter guitar than the 335 or Sheraton types so I don't think my reviews of that will help you much other than to say humbuckers through the semi hollow body can create some great sustain and tones.
One thing of note... the Casino has the neck connecting to the body a lot earlier than the other two guitars you listed.  This really makes access to frets above 17 a challenge.  Something that leaves me wanting to try one of those other guitars.

20-25 can be tough, especially if you expect (as I naively did) to gracefully slide into adulthood and maturity. 
Nobody knows where they're going until 30 at least, but 25 gives you enough experience.
 23 is pretty bad. No longer a child, nowhere near an adult. And nobody tells you this.
They sure don't look very crammed in that picture. It's hard for me to find pitty for these people, maybe they should've thought about it before they committed the crimes they committed and victimized innocent people for their own selfish needs. It's so bad yet the inmates who repeat the offenses and get locked back up keep ending up back inside, that doesn't make much sense. What do these people expect, to go off to some summer camp because lets face it, they are the real victims here they need to be rehabilitated! 
And that's not a "Can't do the time, don't do the crime" mentality. This article is full of bias. Hey lets ask a bunch of inmates if they have anything good to say about the place they've been incarcerated at..... of course they are going to paint it out to be hell on earth, when in reality it's no worse than any other prison. But I guess since it's a female prison and the writer decided to put a selfie of an inmate that looks "pretty" to fool the readers into thinking these are innocent females being held against their will. This isn't cruel or unusual, hell some soldiers in places like Afghanistan have it 100x worse than this and you expect me to have pitty for these selfish people? Not going to happen. 
The selfishness of prison inmates or former prison inmates is ridiculous, I have several family members who've been incarcerated and they are the biggest self centered people I've ever met. And this point is is rampant in this article, just read this part "It's a hostile environment that seems to get worse by the day Please consider re-opening some programs so we can get out of here and try to become productive members of society."
So basically the inmates want the government to take money away from other programs from people who don't victimize others and give it to them so they aren't bored in prison? It's on you do become a productive member of society, why should others have to suffer so your programs can be funded? Prison isn't meant to be a summer camp with lots of activities to keep you from being bored. Why can't you reevaluate your life once you get out of prison and say, look I'm going to go back to school, maybe enroll in a trade program and get my life straight, I never want to go back to that hellish place. Instead they think it's the burden of the state and tax payers to mold them into productive members of society.  
this article is as bias as they come. 
Hey everyone, This is my old 6gb Minecrafted.net server. I dont use it anymore and decided to let GreenDoomsDay use it until the billing cycle expires.
Why I ditched this server
---
---
At the time, I just dumped money into upgrading to this 6gb server. It took them 48+ hours to setup the server. This put me in a foul mood, on top of that, The node (at the time) was VERY laggy. Our 40 player servers were getting bad lag issues and minecrafted.net would just -delete- our support tickets without answering.
So I ditched them, went to NetherByte and upgraded to spigot.
TL;DR
---
---
GreenDoomsDay is using my old minecrafted.net server. If you have any questions, **[shoot me a message]( It'll still be GreenDoomsDay hosting on it, but I'll be around for any technical support regarding the server.

The question doesn't specify whether it refers to being kicked out by parents or a landlord, and since I've never been kicked out by a landlord, I'll share my experience of being kicked out by my parents.
I was a mouthy little shit head when I was younger. When my parents had enough, they kicked me out of the house at age 18 with only 2 weeks notice. The problem with living in Vancouver is the living expenses are unreasonably high, so I had to move into a tiny basement suite with this fat girl. She was an utter slob. Dirty dishes were left sitting out for a month and eventually we got a fruit fly infestation. Cooking at home became near impossible and any outside food I brought in I had to eat in my room with the door closed or else I would be swarmed. I had survived off McDonald coupons until my body couldn't handle it anymore. I still can't stand the taste or smell of their food.
When I had enough, I moved into another two bedroom basement suite that wasn't much better. The place was in a ghetto-ish area. The guy was a heroin addict living with his high school drop out girlfriend and their newborn. It was what you would expect trailer trash living to be like. I'll always remember her using empty vodka bottles as house decorations. At one point, their friends (another couple) fell on hard times and moved into our basement suite, sleeping on the couch. The guy was clinically insane, claiming his father was the devil and had hallucinations of strangers on the street walking up to him and commented how much he looked like his dad. When I questioned him about it, he told me it was all written in the bible. He also accused his girlfriend of cheating on him. Whenever they had sex and she came, he thought her cum was another dude's sperm and claimed a doctor (another hallucination) told him that semen would remain in the vagina and the penis would act like a plunger. The girl would also cry loudly on the phone, talking to her kid who she lost custody over I think... I wasn't too clear on that. Eventually, the heroin addict left his girlfriend and child for his girlfriend's best friend. He also stole a couple hundred dollars from me, which his ex girlfriend payed me back using her government child support fund. I didn't know where the money had come from at the time, but accepting it has left me feeling like a big bag of shit for doing so. It was around this time I started drinking heavily and getting myself in trouble and fights.
When I decided that was enough, I moved into a much nicer but extremely expensive basement suite with the world's biggest douche bag. The guy was some business student who drank cheap, shitty beer, drove a truck, partied late, gay bashed and cheated on his girlfriend in front of me. A real scumbag Steve. The place we lived in was nice but the price left little room for food expenses. I was surviving primarily off of free bread from work and tea. I really got to learn what the meaning of hunger meant.
Of course, I eventually lived in better places with better people, but I had to start at the bottom. My high school friends didn't have to worry about moving out until they were married. They were able to live at home and stockpile money for vacations around the world, whereas the last time I went on a real vacation was when princess Diana died. You could argue that they've seen more of the world than I have, but I've seen more of what life is really like than them.
Moving out at an early age is a gamble. I saw a lot of shit go down at a young age, got into alcohol and drugs pretty heavily and found myself in police handcuffs a few times. I was able to get all the dumb stupid decisions in my life out of the way early so now I can focus on being who I want to be now, rather than learn life lessons at a late age. Despite how shitty it was, you get a feeling of preparedness and future challenges seem less daunting. If I ever find myself with my own kid, I would definitely send him/her out on their own at a young age... I may just not be so reckless about it as my parents were.
Now I'm 27, living outside of Vancouver (don't think I could ever go back) drug and alcohol free, living on my own, working towards creating my own future and making sure I keep a level head. Being kicked out of your house is a minor. Ultimately, the following events after the eviction and how they shape you should be the real focal point. I would be an entirely different person today if I had never been kicked out.
 get yourself kicked out of home and go see some shit if you want to tell an interesting life story.
I was hoping Coles legacy would really have something awesome, or at least something more than: Hey, i can't meet you in person there, (From [Spoiler](#s "Zeke") on evil at least, i don't know about good side yet) but how bout I just talk to you for a second, give you [Spoiler](#s "Cole's jacket, and take those files") and have almost nothing else to do with Cole's story from then till now even though most of it was explained in the main story
 Wishing they would have made Coles legacy nothing more than an easter egg in the game that they included [Spoiler](#s "Zeke") and didnt pretend like it was some sidestory linking the first inFamous games to Delsins story
The sad thing is that the Stolen Valor laws aelre not widely enforced. This dirt bag should have had to surrender his uniform and anything related to the Army. Honestly should have had his ass whipped too. As to the media's role in this. We are not loved by the media, we are not "supported" by them. We are a P.R. tool. It is a very rare instance when I actually come across businesses that truly support us and dont just give a 5% discount on the coffee. 
Tl:dr: Fuck this guy with a hot sauce lubed cactus. Also the media.
"modesty" is another word we've manage to make almost completely about sex when the original had nothing to do with it. I think this is a far more accurate analysis of what the Bible is talking about:

 Modesty in 1 Timothy 2 has more to do with dismantling social class divisions than keeping your skin covered.
My gut reaction is that it's annoying that men think that most women are primarily concerned with being considered attractive.  "Attractive" has such a strong implication that it is for sexual purposes and I don't know if that's truly what you intend.  If you used the word "approachable", I think this is more in line with how women think when preparing themselves to be out in public.
In formulating a response, I considered the reasons I would want to look nice in the presence of men.  My primary motivation for wanting men to find me attractive is so that I can get done what I want to get done.  If I go out in public looking like I just woke up and don't give a crap about what I'm wearing, I might as well be invisible because it seems like my presence is actively ignored.  It seems that most often, if a woman has to deal with a man then she had better make herself at least look nice if she has any hope of being taken seriously.  Whether that's negotiating a business transaction, engaging in a good intellectual discussion or simply not being ignored at a store if I need assistance from a salesman - I always have a better experience if I put on makeup before I leave the house.  
Many women are flirted with or approached by men who would like to engage in a conversation that could lead to sex or romance, often enough that the idea that going out with the explicit intention to make themselves attractive for men is counterproductive to their social well-being.  I know that most men can't relate or it sounds far-fetched, but look at other posts by women on these forums.  Many women speak of being wary when out where there are men who would harass them over their hotness, and are called psycho or paranoid due to their cautious attitude.  If women didn't have to deal with so much unwanted attention (and if the average woman could physically hold off the average man), you wouldn't see so many of these types of comments.
 Most women wear makeup so that they are socially presentable and approachable, not to make themselves (sexually) attractive.
&gt;  I will never convince anyone I've ever dated of this 
Whether or not it's true, no, you won't ever "convince" them. They've had YEARS of social pressure to wear makeup, long before you were in the picture, and in a lot of cases, long before they were sexually active.
I tried once, to convince a girlfriend to just stop wearing makeup, or at the very least severely tone it down. Part of it was selfish (she would literally take HOURS before we would go out), and part of it was that she was goddamn gorgeous without it. It doesn't work. There's too much social pressure on women to look a certain way, and she didn't have the mettle to break that mold. Most of them don't.
I agree with you; women don't.
It's only flawed logic if you don't document your assumptions. Which they did, rendering this a perfectly valid study that makes its premises clear. That disagrees with what you want to believe is true does not invalidate the data or the observation that two items under study are notably misaligned.
This could be interpreted several ways, including *in the exact manner you posit*.
The sanest response is to call for study of said assumption, not to dismiss a bunch of data because an assumption that does not invalidate it is something you desire to be false but lack any data for.
 And what makes your assumptions better, besides your personal warm fuzzies on the subject?
The silly mechanical thing to realize about tap-jumping is that your analog stick will wear out MUCH faster than using a button jump, and that your dead zone will expand more quickly as well.
Tap jumping makes things like JC grabs substantially more difficult and adds a level of difficulty to things like DI and recovery (where you may need to jump one way but DI the other, or DI down but still jump up).
Tap jump is still moderately useful for aerial combos on characters like falcon (tap jump is ideal for fullhop double uair, for example), and can be used to auto-meteor cancel with Jigglypuff/Kirby after a single jump has gone off.
Other than those very niche circumstances though, it offers no advantage over button jumps (but several disadvantages).
 Learn to use the buttons (ideally Y) to jump.
Do I (realistically) think the Yankees will win the World Series? No.
Do I think it is incredibly stupid to bet against Derek Jeter? Yes.
I think the Yanks are *maybe* the 6th best team in the AL and, consistent with that rank, a fringe playoff team. It is perfectly reasonable to expect Jeter to be a complementary player on a competitive team. But this man has stepped up in the biggest way possible in just about every important moment in his career. I think the Yankees go out on top purely because an aging SS (granted a HOF one) wills them to. Storybook ending to a storybook career.
 Yankees will win the WS because Derek Jeter is retiring.
Eastern North Carolinian here.  Twice a year has always been sufficient for my piano at home provided the room its in doesn't have wild temperature &amp; humidity fluctuations.
If for some reason it's horribly out of tune/been ages since its last tuning, the technician can bring it to a point where the notes are in tune relative to each other, but your A won't be singing at 440 Hz.  A return visit or visits will be necessary to gradually bring it back in line.  These are extreme situations, but they do happen to abused &amp; neglected instruments or extremely old ones.
 twice a year barring exceptional circumstances.
Never be afraid to open up to a psychiatrist/therapist, even if it's something as strange as sexual thoughts about them. They can't help you if you don't give them an accurate description of your symptoms.
Have you told her about your difficulty sleeping? She might recommend adding a sleeping aid. In the meantime, try using Benadryl as a sleep aid if your insomnia persists more than two or three nights. You may have some groggy mornings, but it might help add a few hours. 
And yes, hallucinations. Dancing shadows, figures in the corner of my eyes (some very distinct but unrecognizable), and headlights flashing at night (sometimes the flashing persists even when I close my eyes at night). Since starting Lamictal, it's become less frequent, only happening when I'm manic and haven't had a lot of sleep. 
The sequence of letters doesn't establish your humanity. The sequence of letters is just the name given to a collection of cognitive and behavioral tendencies. YOU determine your humanity by fighting the destructive impulses. Keep in mind though, that humanity is an ideal separate and distinct from the way humans and society behave. Maintain your functionality and embody humanity as an ideal rather than conforming to social expectations and trying to fit in, that's just hiding away.

Alright so I was trying to finish off the Dragonborn storyline, and after I was done talking to Neloth, I come out of his mushroom, and see his apprentice standing there trying to get me to solve his "ash gaurdian problem" (killing it)
Being the dopey hero that I am, I agree, but just as I was about to hit the dialogue option, I see this dragon fly in and land his ass down. So now there's this dragon wrecking havoc in the background and it promptly demolishes the ash guardian while I'm just standing there listening to Talvas talk out how badly he fucked up. And the whole time I'm just like "I think you have bigger problems to worry about" but there wasn't a dialogue option for that
While this was happening, I had like four followers at the time, so Vilkas, Farkas, Aela, and Serana draw their weapons and all go charging after this dragon, and Talvas is STILL talking to me while I'm just standing there, watching them all fuck this dragon's day up. By the time Talvas finishes and lets me exit conversation, the dragon is already dead, and my followers rush back and stare at me like nothing happened
**** Talvas wants me to kill his ash guardian, dragon comes in and kills it for me, followers kill the dragon after that, all while Talvas is ranting at me and [I'm just standing there like an idiot]( 
I agree that the situation in Chicago is one of the worst in the nation.  Where I am at (Florida) we have had recent laws passed that make it far easier for teachers to be fired.  New teachers can no longer receive tenure.  Existing teachers have been given slight pay boosts to giving up tenure.  And contracts must be renewed yearly.  
What happened in Chicago was the unfortunate result of fixing a problem so much that they created a new (and in many ways worse) problem.  If you look at teaching contracts from 20's and 30's, teachers in Chicago could get fired for being seen in public with a man, getting married, or loitering at an ice cream parlor.  So they passed laws to make it more difficult to fire teachers, but they made it too difficult. 
 And the main reason why they are fighting the accountability isn't so much the accountability, but the fact that it almost always includes removing tenure. (I am not an expert about what is going on in Illinois, I am stating this based off of other incidents that I know of)  As a person entering teaching removing tenure doesn't sound like that bad of an idea.  But to a teacher who has been around for 30 years and is making twice as much as a starting teacher would, of course they fear tenure being removed.  Because once tenure is gone, a long time teacher could be let go at the end of the year simply because the school can hire 2 new teachers for the same cost. 
The only other problem with saying teachers are fighting accountability is the question of, "who are teachers accountable too?"  The rightly held view in the teaching profession is that unless you are or have been a teacher, you have no right to look at test scores and judge a teacher.  So yes teachers fight this type of accountability.  Here in Florida teachers have been much more open to a mix of test scores and in person evaluations.  There are still teachers down here who fight against it, who try to resist being accountable, who want an easy pass on their job, but they are the minority. 
TL DR- Yes Chicago is fucked up, but they do not represent the entirety of teachers (or even the majority I hope).  
That's because a lot of feminists (the really loud vocal ones, consider feminism as a men hate group). If you google feminism and hate group, you'll come across plenty of ''important feminists'' with quotes like : We should keep men in cages, they are only good for breeding.
They have also placed adds along the lines of :
'' there is a X% chance i will beat my wife! (with a picture of a little boy)''
It's pretty fucking sickening. Women activist groups have also lobbied against Men's Rights Activists, insisting that if we fund MRA'S that leaves less money out for Women.
Also they have actually lobied against joint custody : " Because many women should not have to see their abusive Husbands''.
overall I have to disagree with their movement. They started off with the Right idea and id quickly just turned into a cultural phenomenon. Most feminists don't even know of any prominent feminists speakers. They only think it's about Women's Right's. 
I'm personally for Women's Right's but I'm not a feminist. I'm more of a humanist if anything. I think we should both have equal pay, equal everything. But you know what that means? It means you would have to remove all gender roles in society, because as it is, men pay for a lot more then women in a relationship. Is it because we make more? or because its the mans Job? How many girls do you hear complain when a guy asks to split the bill? I know there are some women who are very independent, and POWER TO YOU!
I Just don't think that making men ''public enemy number one'' is the way to go. I think its more important to look at possible solutions, as in decreasing income disparity and offering equal opportunity. This goes for guys as much as for girls. Honestly when's the last time you saw a guy work at La Vie en Rose? (lingerie store). You rarely do, if ever. 
Women get these extra social benefits in order to make them feel more at ''ease'' and men get payed more and get harsher sentences. When's the last time you got off a speeding ticket for pulling your Vneck boys, or flexing those biceps? Ladies when's the last time you were told your clothes were too promiscuous, but guys wear less clothing?
**TLDR : Gender equalities are a part of our culture. If you want to fix them, you might as well join a cause that works with BOTH parties. As both sides can contribute, instead of fighting tooth and nail to change the other side.** 
dont fucking associate marijuana with your fucked up sadistic enjoyment of death. Weed laws are criticized enough. shitty people like you smoke weed just like everyone else, unfortunately the right wing media focuses on moral shit bags like you.

Swan Song feels like it's still a high buy-in. At this point in foil RIP's printing cycle, it was at the same price foil Swan Song is now. So I would expect foil SS, a card with very similar demand to foil RIP, to hit the same low RIP is at now in about a year. If I were speccing, I'd buy in at $5 or less when they're close to or at rotation.
That said, much as I did with foil RIPs, I do feel perfectly safe trading for a personal-collection playset right now because I have no intention of getting rid of them and they will most certainly be worth more than $10 in the long run, just as RIP foils will be.
- If you want to own them, go for it. If you just want to spec, wait for the buy-in to drop.
I had a similar problem when I installed Linux to my laptop. I accidentally pulled the 32bit installer instead of the 64 bit installer.  I got no sound from the 32, but everything else worked fine. I reinstalled with 64, and everything was happy.
Alternately, is everything unmuted?
 Are you sure it's a 32 bit system?

This was not in absence of government.  This is due to unnatural governmental interventions.
&gt; I'm not spending 40 minutes hearing a libertarian video about why something to do with slavery means I am wrong. or nevermind.
It's worth while, even if you aren't a libertarian.  However, one thing I found surprising is how rampant and brutal slavery was (and still is, been there/seen it) in the Arab world.
I've had the old one then upgraded as soon as retina came out.
Retina version is amazing. It's MUCH faster and MUCH cleaner. Looking at the old screen feels like watching the world through a mosquito net.
The only downside is that it's 0.05 lbs heavier. While this is a very nominal weight, it makes a difference when you're holding it above your head one-handed.

Bro-science.
Not eating before lifting may help with lipolysis (breaking down fat).  To minimize any type of muscle wasting, it might be advised to take some BCAAs ala LeanGains style, but it's not imperative.  The most important window to hit is post workout.  Get a good whack of protein (and carbohydrates for glycogen replenishment) within 2 hours post workout (the timeline is madly debated, but the reality is it takes your body up to 6 hours to metabolize protein to the point where it can start using it to repair muscle fibers, and you're going to be in a state of repair for 24-48 hours anyway...)
So,   BCAAs may be helpful if you're trying to maximize hypertrophy, but generally, getting enough food in your post workout is where the importance lies.
I suspect that, if he was concerned, he's either been misinformed (which isn't necessarily his fault--there's a LOT of pseudo-science and misinterpretations in all good fitness-related literature*; not only on the internet), or he himself has issues managing working out fasted.
But if there's one thing that's for certain, what works for one person doesn't mean it works for all people.  Some individuals have some insulin regulation problems and require that food to help them "jump start" glycolysis.  I suspect that between your own diet and glycogen reserves you're more efficient in gluconeogenesis (when glycogen becomes depleted), so you have less of an issue in working out fasted.
  If it works: keep doing it!
* Even the good science is starting to disagree with the 'older' good science.  It's ever-evolving, just like all good research nowadays.
In the past 13 years, if someone found an exploit for XP, they could exploit it only for as long as it took Microsoft to discover the vulnerability, patch it, and release the patch, usually on patch Tuesday.  They had to try and hide their exploit from discovery, as once it's discovered, Microsoft can find and fix the problem.  That was when Microsoft said they would patch exploits in XP.
Now imagine that any exploit you find is guaranteed NOT to be patched, as Microsoft is no longer patching XP.  You don't have to worry nearly as much anymore about constantly evolving existing exploits and discovering new ones.  Found one that works?  It'll continue to work, whether it's discovered "in the wild" or not.  With the install base of XP still being relatively high, it creates some extremely appealing targets.
Consider this: if in the past couple of months you found an XP exploit, would you rather A) exploit it now and risk it getting patched in the next couple of months, or B) hide your exploit from the world until AFTER the final XP patch from Microsoft is released, then exploit away as much as you wanted?
 Any new exploits discovered for XP will always remain exploitable due to no new patches being released.
The Lib Dems actually *gained* votes in the last election, and this was partly down to Clegg and partly down to popular policies and Labour voters jumping ship. They lost seats because of a history of Gerrymandering by the two dominant parties which meant they were pretty much always the runners up behind a dominant Labour or Conservative candidate. This is why we need to change the election system from first past the post, and shake up the constituencies a bit, a large proportion of people are not represented by either the party or candidate they voted for.
Now for European elections, we have a proportional representation system. This is how Farage himself is an MEP, along with 8 other UKIP MEPs, meaning they actually get a say on EU policy matters. I doubt UKIP will get more than a single seat in the next UK general election for the same reasons mentioned above, UKIP votes will be spread across the country, across many constituencies. Farage might get a seat because he's well known, but as for the other UKIP candidates? I seriously doubt it.
Also, to add to your point about UKIP forming a coalition with a hated party, I don't think it needs to be like that. What we have is a situation where any party that UKIP may join in a coalition doesn't share the same view on their most important policy; EU membership. The best he's ever going to get is a referendum, and like the electoral reform referendum pushed by the Lib Dems in this coalition government, it is not going to turn out like they or their supporters hoped. UKIP will not be able to make a difference unless they somehow become the third or even second largest party by number of seats.
UKIP will get a lot of votes but won't get enough seats to make a difference because of the current electoral system, which makes UKIP very similar to the Lib Dems in this regard. 
Here's my similar story.
Traveling with my Austrian friend in a small town in Czech Republic (I'm American). He is fluent in German and English. I know enough German to have a basic understanding, but I'm not fluent (I studied Spanish in school instead). 
We belly up to a bar next to two really huge men. We speak no Czech, but these two enormous meat-head looking Czech dudes spoke fluent German and some English. Turns out these guys are twins, and they're aspiring professional wrestlers. University educated guys, but they want to make it big in the WWE or whatever. Looking at them, I could see success in their plans. They were seriously ripped dudes. 
So we're chatting in German, I can barely keep up with the conversation. My buddy would whisper English translations if I looked lost. Suddenly, I hear a loud American voice. At a distant table, some long-haired hippie looking douchebag starts yelling at his GF (in English). "Oh, yeah? Well why don't you just go up to those two meatheads and offer them blowjobs then, you whore? Huh? If you want to fuck them so bad just go ahead and do it!" 
The girl had her head down, starting to cry. 
I looked at my buddy. He looked at me. We looked at the Czech twins. They looked at us. We all understood 100% what this asshole was saying. And he didn't stop. His torrent of abuse just went on and on. The girl was sobbing at this point. We had had enough. 
The Czech twins got up first. They walked to the douchebag's table and spoke in fairly decent English: "Excuse me, ma'am, is this man bothering you? Do you need any assistance?" 
She just buried her face in her hands. But Mr. Douchebag shrunk to the size of a rat, which suited him. As the Czech twins stood over the table, I quietly agreed with my Austrian friend to intervene as well. I offered in perfect American English, "Ma'am, if you need help, we have plenty of money. We can get you home if you want to go home. America, Canada, whatever. Seriously. We can help."
She shook her head "no", and went back to sulking. 
The Czech twins sauntered back to the bar and we went back to discussing the "dumme Arschloch" in German. Within a minute the couple left. 
If you could have seen that weasel's face when those two Czech behemoths walked up to his table...it was a thing of beauty. 
And yes, my Austrian pal and I would have split her travel fare home. We're not super rich, but we could easily afford airfare for a damsel in distress, especially if it meant freedom from the dumme Arschloch. 
** everyone knows some English, so watch your ass. Oh, and don't be a douchebag. You may end up pummeled by gigantic Czech wrestlers.** 

Speak comfortably? Right now, two: Japanese and English.
Brief language history:
- Swedish-German grandma only spoke mixed-up Swe-Deutsch to me until ~12
- mother spoke French, her mom &amp;amp; relatives spoke Italian. Read all my mom's French books
- Four years Spanish in high school 
- during HS had a thing for exchange students: a German, an Argentine, and a Spainard (though the Argentine was a cheater and wasn't with me all year lol). Lots of conversation practice 
- one year each of Russian, Italian, French and German in university
- 18-month intensive Chinese Mandarin course, lived in Taiwan several months, spent a total of several months on the mainland
- came to Japan as a tourist during a break from work, thought the language was similar to Chinese, studied in coffeeshops for four months 
- interviewed and got a job in Japanese. Worked in primarily-Japanese environments for ~ a decade

Now?  
I know a bunch of phrases and can understand much of French. No confidence speaking.
Know the Italian names of all types of pasta
Remember remembering speaking German with a weird Swedish-isch accent
Understand standard Mandarin, can read subway signs and most menus
Keeping them straight? Lol nope. When I try to speak French it comes out with a bunch of Spanish words and false friends from English. When I try mandarin these days I end up with Japanese words mixed in. My Italian is basically my Spanish with a bad fake accent.
Speak only English and Japanese with any fluency. When I have time to sit down an write though, I can usually get my point across in French and Chinese.
I had business correspondence with someone in France last year. We had four or five exchanges until she wrote back in English saying "I really appreciate the effort, and though I understand you perfectly maybe English is easier for you, so let's use it going forward."  
 I've been exposed to a lot of languages, but only comfortably "speak" the ones I use regularly and recently
I was simplifying a little and also guessing a little. I never turned a kiln on at high and ran it 100% until it was done, so I don't really know how long it would take.
I used to have a manual kiln that had 1/4 power, 1/2 power, and full power settings. And I once figured out, based on how long I ran it at each of those settings, that it cost around $6.00. But I don't remember all the details.  
Now I have a computerized kiln. I like a slow program with a hold and downfiring. And even when the kiln is on its fastest heating cycle, it cycles on and off, so it isn't pulling a constant 48A. 
 I want to change my answer to somewhere between $5.00 and $10.00, more or less. 
&gt; ...And a sovereign nation has this right to develop its own speciality in industry. 
Unless this sovereign state signed a trade treaty that conferred other benefits, and now wishes to enjoy those benefits while restricting trade in ways forbidden by that treaty.
The WTO response will probably be to allow the US to retaliate against Indian goods, another example of "a sovereign nation having a right to determine how it trades."
 If you don't want WTO actions brought against you, don't sign WTO agreements.
For many city and urban areas like Bay Area, LA, NYC there is no natural reason or need for a gun (I'm not counting organized crime as a natural reason you should have a gun). 
Areas where a lot of gun rights are stereotypically located (Texas, Alabama, and Montana), there  is still a lot of wilderness out there with very dangerous animals (wolves, bears, and coyotes). You need to have a gun on you to defend yourself because you cant really outrun the dangerous animals in short distances. Many people who carry guns out in the cities usually originated from these areas and guns are a part of their culture and identity similar to how Fire Crackers are to Chinese New Years. 
There are gun owners who own guns strictly to defend themselves against other humans (criminals and gangsters). In most cases these guns are kept in the glove compartment and/or house since it is a last resort option. 
*** Americans keep guns for two reasons: to protect themselves since they live out in open land/wilderness or as a last resort against criminals. 
It's one of the bill of rights amendments to the United States Constitution (the second one) which when written was to act as a counter-balance to the armed forces of the government. If the people are armed, resistance is more feasible. Also, America has a long history of hunting and providing for ourselves. The rifle is a symbol of America's independence and is still quite handy in many farming societies. Although there aren't really any pioneers left or places to discover, we have a good amount of backcountry and while a firearm is not an absolute necessity, it never hurts to have one if you encounter feral dogs, mountain lions, grizzly bears, rutting moose or the occasional escaped exotic large pet cat. We can also protect ourselves against attack by other people with the threat of lethal force. While they are not a necessity for self suicide or 'suicide by cop', they are a favorite tool for both.
Unfortunately, in our current society, there are many people who feel weak and alienated. They are scared of those not like them, the young and the poor. They are threatened by unfamiliar situations, cultures, languages, religious practices and differing skin color. Carrying a gun makes many people feel more secure, even though the chances of a shooting accident increase exponentially by adding a gun to the mix. Firearms for these cowards allows them to have a shitty xenophobic voice that they can project to the public at large. It allows these otherwise meek and powerless pathetic people to exert their will and beliefs on their neighbors, families, co-workers and strangers.
Furthermore, the gun industry in America is large and very profitable. It is in the best interest of the manufacturers to fight against any type of regulation or control that is suggested whether it is in the best interest of the majority of Americans or not. The political system in America permits the gun manufacturers to essentially buy a voice that overpowers those of the majority and the elected politicians gain politically and financially by either supporting our refusing to speak out against the gun industries interests. There are factons of political parties that espouse an ideology of separation, paranoia and hate that many people identify with as it plays to their fears. Part of this hypocritical platform is the refusal to accept any sort of gun control in America. As Charlton Heston said "YOU CAN PRY MY GUN FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!" This ideology forms part of the basis of the current class war that is tearing at our countries seams and demonstrating to the world that it's almost impossible for 350 million people with no common bond or history to agree on anything.
- Self sufficiency, personal responsibly and freedom is represented by gun ownership in America. It's just too bad that the people can't be trusted with them.
You're absolutely right one have to be very careful when doing this.
I'm in the engeenering and consulting business, mostly for heating and cooling system, but I work daily with buildings of all sizes, and I consulted some very knowledgable people on the topic.
The load is mostly the large top beams against the outside walls, made of reinforced concrete.
These secondary beams I replaced are just there for geometry, there is nearly no vertical load, or these would NOT be held with such weak nail plates. Also, these lower horizontal beam you see, are in two part, held together also by a nail plate. Such an assembly would not last a single minute if there was any kind of load applied. 
: Only the top beams are critical.
&gt; Everything I'm asking? You mean the one question I've asked? Also, don't pretend to know sociology and say "GOOGLE YOUR 

Suppose you founded a company and it was branded CalcCo. Now, suppose your company was originally interested in the manufacture of calculators. As you garnered success in the calculator game, you eventually broadened your portfolio to things like small appliances (microwaves, TVs, toasters), and eventually moved on to bigger things (like cars and motorcycles). Throughout the company's existence, you keep the label due to brand recognition. I mean, at the end of the day, just because your company uses the name "CalcCo" doesn't mean that you need to focus exclusively on calculators. Furthermore, if you were to constantly re-brand yourself each time you took on a new product focus, you would likely hurt your pre-existing market share. Fewer people would recognize it and, as a result, it hurts you.
Now, I'm not comparing feminism to a company. It's a philosophical/social movement catered towards equality in myriad forms across the board. Its primary focus is eliminating the inequality that women face, but it acknowledges and seeks to resolve all forms of inequality where possible (at least the feminism I subscribe to). Feminism is stronger as a unified movement, as a recognized movement. It can change but by maintaining the label, it's possible to have a better notion of its history and its original aims, and, furthermore, its general track record for success.

**A very poor ** It's better to maintain brand recognition and maintain awareness of the growth and development of the movement. The name is practically just a formality at this point thanks to intersectionality.

By all means, anyone better in the know than I can and *should* correct me on this. But that's my take on the issue of nomenclature.
Sadly, no. This subreddit is similar to a porn subreddit. We come here to ogle beautiful handwriting and sexy calligraphy. 
Unfortunately, your penmanship doesn't really fit to this mould. It came here with its frumpy curves and lopsided balance.
Though, many people may think it is beautiful in its own right it doesn't really cater to the vast masses of this subreddit.
It may be best to try your hand at the /r/Handwriting subreddit first and work on your form.
Then, maybe one day, you can grace the front page of this sub and prove our tastes all wrong...

The younger me's would find the older me's to be horrible, moralless, monsters. The older me's would be in frustrated agony having to try and explain to the younger me's that they do not have the experience to comprehend life and that they need to shut up and try to listen/understand a different perspective for two seconds.
The problem being that while trying to explain to a younger age another even older age would come up correcting the previous older age.
 Everyone thinks everyone's an idiot... Oh shit I already do that.
My musical tastes have changed a lot over the years so i think that my selves would fight over music a lot. Elementary school me's would be trying to play a Michael Jackson CD, teen age me's would be knocking elementary school me's over and playing more modern, alternative music and talking about what girls were hottest in high school. Then the me's in their 20's would be playing some super modern Alternative music, Eminem, mocking teenage me's and showing them how fat they were(YAY ME!), eventually around 23 the me's would stop fighting the younger me's and start smoking weed in our room and take turns jacking off to old porn mags they hid in there. The thirties and mid fourties would probably be too busy to attend the party. The fifty year old me's would show up in red 1960's mustangs, smoke cigars and brag about their new trophy wife. The 60 year old me's would drink two scotches feel wasted, complain about how their wife left them to the fifties and describe the latest medical odditeis they had. The seventies and eighties would put the sixties to shame, by describing every grisly medical procedure at length, talk about how all their close friends had died, the kids didnt visit them anymore and that they couldnt even get an erection at this point, not even morning wood! The nineties would sit, together, surveying the crowd of me's wistfully. They would laugh at their teenage selves, and wonder where my life went. But strangely enough, they would be the happiest members of the party.They would be happy because they would know that I had lived a full life. One of love, and hate, happiness and sorrow. And i think that 100 year old me would be able to die happy after imparting me with some of the wisdom i had gained along the way.
i have bad taste in music and i die wise.
 
Sorry this was so long and a bit of a tangent. It started off with me thinking about how my musical tastes have changed along the way, but i realized that more than just our taste in music changes as we get older. I hope this reflects that.
The government would storm in, detaining each and everyone of us.
Rival nations would hear of the "Time-Traveling Cheese" and would run special ops over the next decade to unlock the secrets of time travel.
It would be uncovered it wasn't time travel but a series of cloning experiments where a duplicate would be produced every year.
The experiments were perfected to the point where entire armies could be produced, and war broke out.
Starwars Pre-prequels in the making.
Since I've been going to that damn party once every year for all my life, I'd already pretty much know what will be going on. First, we'd all agree that I hate birthday parties.
Then, 100 years old me would show everyone else the awesome gaming consoles/PC from the future, and we'd start the best LAN party ever. Probably with multiplayer coop future skyrim and fallout. With booze. And future me oogling past girlfriends, knowing every dirty notches of their dirty minds, while one of them gets what's going on and realize that future girlfriends means that our relationship won't last.
Also, all my wife would probably have an insane party, which would be awesome.
 Nothing weird or anything, really.
1 is a babbling mess, giggling quietly to himself in the corner with a piece of cake. 2 and 3 are hiding in terror from my younger brother who was larger than me for the first six months of my life.
4 is busy watching his first M-rated movie (hint: it stars sigourney weaver) and doesn't pay too much attention to things. 5, 6 and 7 are playing around on the TV with a Sega system that JUST WON'T WORK!
8, 9 and 10 are at the food table, getting a standing ovationg at some point for their triumphant return to the desserts. 11 through to 16 are fat, depressed and not talking to many people. In fact, 14 has dropped out of school and is hiding in the corner with a Gameboy. 17 has gone back to school and is jamming with 18 on the guitars, and 19 offers to do a booze run just to show off his driving.
19 through 21 are busy with their first serious girlfriend, progressively getting more and more unhappy until 21 dumps the bitch for knifing him.  22 has been accepted into uni and has got the first really interesting stories about his travels to Asia, and is the first of the truly sociable people. 23 has more to say about psychology and brags a little about getting so far in his studies. 24 and 25  are really interesting people, have dropped about 20kg thanks to the next serious girlfriend and extols the virtues of bacon beer!
26 through 28 are secretly concerned about money, as they are trying to save for a house and by 30 they are feeling the pressure to start a family. 31 through 35 are chasing their kids around and spending more and more money on their tattoos. 36 through 38 are discussing their PhD thesis and 39 or 40 will be bragging about having the term Dr. affixed to the front of their name.
41 through to 50 are relaxing a lot more and relying on their investments, so they have more hobbies and offer up their services, or arrange ski trips and mountain biking expeditions. Yes, they are very fit and keeping their bone density up. 51 through 55 are not present, as they're on a motorcycling sabbatical around Europe, and 56 has some of the grandest stories that 57 and 58 are also telling. 59 and 60 are getting bored with life and have suspiciously "glassy" eyes.
65 is busy experimenting with soooo many different drugs and is the best friend of 18 and 19. 67 through 70 have no idea about reality and have been rolled in completely comatose from the old folks home. 71 has been given an experimental drug that brings back mental clarity and is playing logic games with 72, 73 and 74. 75 through 100 are busy babysitting the grandchildren so that  their kids might get to go to their own 100 year anniversary party.
- Cloning would be awesome.
I would stay the fuck away from everyone. Meeting literally anyone at this party will cause any number of people to cease to exist as the person that they are at the party in question.
**TL:DR** Space time continuum 
Okay, you asked so you get the full story:
Was single, travelling Europe alone, met a woman in Venice travelling alone as well. Let's call her The American. Met in a backpackers, ended up exploring the city together, which turned into seeing a chamber music concert and drinking wine. She had a girlfriend back home who she had been fighting with and there was a lot of tension. I was getting over a long term relationship. 
There was wine, there was a beach, there was a BED ON THE BEACH, she made a Harry Potter reference ("What is this, the room of requirement?") and we hooked up (first mistake) . Figured it was a one night travel fling, I felt kinda slutty and like the other woman, we added each other on Facebook (second mistake), I left Venice the next morning. 
Few days later I mention on Facebook I'm in Rome, and lo and behold so is the American! So we meet up. Drink LOTS of whiskey. Make out in front of several ancient buildings. Totally kissed her in the Vatican, didn't get struck by lightening. Spend 2 days in Rome together, abandoning our hostels and getting a hotel room together (third mistake). I leave Rome and head back to Australia feeling all giddy. It's true what they say about lesbians. We get feelings FAST. I had fallen for her. 
Fast forward a few weeks, she's back from her holiday and starts telling me about all her feelings for me and all the issues with her girlfriend. Tells me they broke up (fourth mistake) . Over time it evolves into a relationship with declarations of love and promises to wait for each other and plans to see each other. I am so blindly in love I don't see any of the warning signs. I put myself in way too much debt and book tickets to go to the States to see her over Christmas (fifth mistake), but the closer it gets to Christmas the less keen she is. Found out later she had gotten back together with her girlfriend. She's pulling away and I'm panicking, and one day she cuts me off and gives me radio silence for a week. I get clingy, shits ugly. In that week she mentally breaks up with me. Never told me that though, so I think we're still together, until one day she drops on me that "I am a single lady after all". She still calls me drunk and tells me she loves me, then the next morning tells me about the awesome sex she's having with her girlfriend. 
This is a month before I was set to fly over there. I'm heartbroken. Never been heartbroken before but this is full blown, sad songs suddenly making sense, can't sleep, can't think, can't cry misery. I cancel the flight, get a credit I have to use in a year, and go on a road trip into the desert while my friends put up with my moping.
It's something I can laugh about now, but it still makes me angry when I remember how much she made a fool of me, and how I made a fool of myself. I learned not to fall so fast after that. She still tries to contact me every now and again, the odd email of "hi, how are you going?" or "do you still hate me?", she doesn't get the hint of ignoring her for 2 years. 
Not that huge compared to other people's dramas, but to me it hurt like hell and wish I'd never been so dumb. 
END OF MASSIVE COMMENT! 
 never be the other woman in a long distance relationship 
I dont think what I do changes the lives of my other years instantly. Like, they are seperate, similar timelines. Cuz if so many of myself are meeting in the same place, if what each of me does or says to each other me has an impact on my life, then all of my selves would be constantly changing and wouldnt have said the thing they said to younger me in the first place. I might've even died at 12 making me unable to give myself advice in the first place that would kill me. 
 tfw paradox

Every previous self would be like "how the hell did you get from there to there in 1 year, and you over there you're only three years away from that guy how the hell did you get from there to there in three years"

Dispelling and getting the pitlord positioning for felhunters right were the two things that make the fight. One of his dots ticks really high after some time so keep yourself dispelled.
More ilvl just gives more room for error and makes for a faster kill. You can do it in a set of timeless isle gear I guess (I couldn't but then destro was very new to me and I had to get some practice first).
 dispell, dispell, dispell.
No. Wolf of the Plains is just how Iggulden wished the dramatic scenes of Genghis's rise to power happened. It's great fiction, sure, but come on ...
It was disappointing to see such suspension of disbelief from the man who wrote Emperor. Which, come to think of it, was almost as bad. 
 skip conquer, and field of swords.
I think there are a few more factors to consider.
The first is the prevailing political climate internationally. Throughout the series, the Federation is apparently acting under some international expectation that it maintain open navigation through the Bajoran Wormhole. This is a touchy subject, especially because the nearest great power is the Cardassian Union. Can you imagine what Cardassian High Command would do or say in response to Starfleet stationing front line units at such a location?
This is further complicated by the events preceding the Dominion War, especially the conflict with the Klingon Empire, and the Federation's pre-existing threat environment. As a matter of course, Starfleet is pretty spread out; their primary mission is ~~organization~~ exploration, and the Federation actually has kind of a lot of pressing defense concerns. So on top of all of these high priority routine deployments, you have a war with the Klingons near the Cardassian border, something guaranteed to leave units that would otherwise be in place to defend Deep Space 9 out of position.
Speaking of politics, let's talk about the Bajorans. Remember how Bajoran terrorists kept attacking the station? The reason was, as I recall, that most of them saw the Federation as some kind of new occupying force. Can you imagine the public reaction to Starfleet responding to limited isolationist elements by deploying troops and starships to the system? Can you imagine the international reaction? Yes, the wormhole is there and important, but that's a can of worms too. "Sorry, we have to bring in troops to defend the wormhole." "You mean **our** wormhole?"
Lastly, consider that while the Federation was hoping for a diplomatic solution, they were in fact the ones that started the war, and they did it in an incredibly clever way. The strategic value of DS9 is extremely high, but that value is primarily derived from its position near the wormhole. Starfleet's act of war, the minefield, neatly removed much of the value of this real-estate. Realizing that due to pre-existing strategic concerns that Starfleet would never be able to defend DS9 from conventional Dominion attack in a cost-effective manner Starfleet opts instead to attack Dominion/Cardassian assets. The de facto value of these assets has been dramatically raised by denying the Dominion access to alternative sources of reinforcements, and the value of Deep Space 9 has been dramatically lowered by that same act.
Between cutting Deep Space 9 loose and hitting Torros III, the Federation gains two things. The first thing is that they've eliminated a difficult-to-defend position of limited value that would have tied down fleet resources through the need to defend it, instead keeping the initiative. The second thing they gain is valuable time; as we've discussed, Starfleet is spread pretty thin, and they need time to concentrate their forces.
- Before the war, Starfleet is constrained by politics. Once the war starts, DS9 is an expensive asset of limited value and Starfleet needs time to get set and tech up.

Unfortunately, regulation is the best answer we've come up with to overcome collective action problems by which  individuals acting in their own best interests create a socially undesirable outcome in the aggregate. I assume you're familiar with the prisoner's dilemma, etc. 
Consider pollution. Because it's expensive and difficult to purchase sustainable energy, the market-driven solution has always been toward cheaper, dirtier power. But we're not satisfied with that market outcome because it makes us sick and poisons our environment. So we regulate coal plants etc. to force them to be cleaner even though consumers have been unwilling to bargain for those benefits on their own.
Successful businesses like Costco are few and far between and it would be irrationally optimistic to think that the answer to stagnant wages is just to hope that everyone will stop buying cheap stuff so that retail workers make a living wage. Simple economics explains why Walmart, and not Costco, is the biggest retailer in the world. Sure, it might happen in isolated examples, but it's clear that the trend is not a general one we can rely upon to solve our problems here.
** Regulation has plenty of problems, but that doesn't mean it's always inferior to laissez faire. Very roughly: smart regulation &gt; no regulation &gt; dumb regulation.**
&gt;This has really stood out to me as a direct contradiction to everything I've heard about socialism
Well there is socialist theory, and their are societies that have called themselves socialist – and historically the two often have little or nothing to do with each other.  When most people think of socialism they think of USSR's Bolshevism.  Sure it called itself socialist, and maybe some people tried to make it that way, but from the beginning it was pretty much an anti-socialist oppressive regime that pretended it was "socialist" as a cover to convince its people that their essentially plutocratic fascist state was actually good for them.  It is a lot easier to send people to the gulags when you tell them "this is for your own good ... uh ... comrade" then "get in the fucking hole you political dissident!  This will teach you to commit thought crime!"
This distinction is not retroactive either.  The USSR officially came to be in 1922.  Meanwhile a famous anarcist/socialist thinker named Bakunin warned repeatedly in 1870: “Take the most radical revolutionary and place him on the throne of all Russia, or give him dictatorial power, and before a year has passed he will become worse than the Czar himself.”  Similarly during the course of the USSR's existence, many prominent socialists outside the USSR repeatedly commented on how the USSR's fundamental tenants of operation flew in the face of the primary principles of socialism.  As an example, one particularly prominent and respected socialist thinker who continuously offered such criticism during the course of the USSR from early on is Rosa Luxembourg.  Then after its collapse, many prominent socialist thinkers such as Noam Chomsky [looked at the now revealed state documents and wrote essays at length pointing out the fundamentally un-socialist nature of things there that were only revealed to the outside world post facto](
there is a huge gulf between socialist theory and what people think of socialism because some particularly horrible and repressive societies hid their awful deeds behind the term "socialism" to try and make themselves and their actions more palatable and acceptable to people.
Very few actual socialist societies of any scale have existed.  Different socialists will have different opinions on what counts, but the largest I can think of by my standards is probably the still tiny and short lived [Paris Commune.](
Things are just getting worse. To open a ticket i need to know my origin email and password. I can't remember the password and on xbox there is no "forgot your password?" option. There is only an update your email/password option and you need to know your current password to update it! I thought i'd go on the mobile version as it does have a forgot your password option. But guess what? The servers are down!

So, really, I think you should reconsider the advice you're giving here. If you've ever worked with powertools or tried to actually get scratches out of glass, you'll realize your advice won't help much. It takes a _lot_ of effort to get scratches out of glass. We're talking powertools at high RPMs with polishing compound power. Not just "wiping". In the old days, toothpaste could be used to polish out plastic, but glass? Nope.
Furthermore, Oleophobic coatings these days will last for years and years. It takes a good amount of abuse to get rid of them - and when they wear through - you will see it. There will be a different tint to the glass surface at the sites of wear-through. If you presently do not see any patch of wear through on your phone, you should _not_ attempt any of the advice here - you will only shorten the lifespan of your coatings.
Toothpaste is for the old days. Only do it if you have NO oleophobic coating left ony our phone. Otherwise, you will exacerbate the problem and destroy more of the coating.
- Toothpaste is not good for any modern touch interface - only old plastic. Toothpaste will accelerate the wear of your oleophobic coating - which is very tough and will last at the very least 2-3 years of constant use. 
I got a new phone a few months ago. The screen protectors came a month later. While I was cleaning the screen to put the protector on I noticed there were already tiny scratches all over the screen. You could only notice them by looking at the screen's reflection while it was off.

IMO, many truly dedicated Smash Bros fans will likely end up buying both version (like myself).
However, individuals who don't really regard Smash Bros as a "system seller" type game but rather just a nice/fun game that they'd like to pick up most likely would not buy a Wii U just for Smash.
 Die hard fans of Smash will likely get the Wii U version regardless/in addition to the 3DS version, however it will hurt Smash Wii U sales for those who aren't die hard fans.
Okay, let me start off by saying I enjoyed Bioshock Infinite immensely. I bought it day one and was happy with my time with it. It is definitely a good game, and an enjoyable game. The setting is awe inspiring and very unique and many would agree that it was one of the best games of 2013, as evident with the Metacritic score. 
That said, there are plenty of ways in which it didn't impress enough to be classified as the "greatest game of all time" by a large amount of people. I personally do not think you will see this game thrown around as people's favorite game in 10 years, the same way Zelda, Halo 2, (etc) is today. But let's get into it.
For one, gameplay. 
The gameplay was a typical shooter, which if you like that, wasn't a bad thing. The problem however, lies within the repetitive nature of the combat. You are limited to only two weapons at once the entire game meaning you have to pick your weapons carefully. This doesn't encourage playing around, instead if pushes you to choose one or two you like and stick with it. Besides that, Vigors, while fun, were never radical enough to be in the front of your mind. Because most of them were simply assets in combat instead of it's focus, I personally found myself forgetting to use them multiple times. Together this meant combat that remained relatively static the entire game. Combat didn't ever truly change with the introduction of new vigors, it was more like getting a new type of grenade. 
And besides that, I found player movement speed to be slow in a way that felt detrimental to the game. Walking but also reloading. It made sense as an aid to atmosphere in the original murky hallways of Bioshock, but in bright open Columbia, it didn't really aid the atmosphere and instead just slowed things down. The skyhooks helped with this, but again they weren't present most of the game, or dynamic enough to truly change the combat. Instead they just moved you around, or were used as way to regen some health.
Next, the level design itself.
Personally, I found this the most disappointing aspect of Bioshock Infinite. Columbia had such a beautiful world and atmosphere, but unfortunately by the end of the game I realized I hadn't experienced most of it because Bioshock Infinite was incredibly linear. This isn't necessarily a bad thing until you pair it with static combat, and then have most of the game be combat, and then design all the levels around this combat. Think about it like this, how cool would it be to show Elizabeth's tower off in the distance and then allow the player a few different routes to get there. Imagine jumping off one "island" and being able to skyhook over. Really think about the amazing possibilities a city like Columbia could offer (acknowledging hardware constraints etc), and then contrast that with the multitude of similar balcony's, hallways, and plazas we just had to walk through or occasionally sky hook past in linear sequences or cutscenes. If I remember right, one of the most open parts of the game was simply a big circle. 
Lastly, the narrative. Potential Spoiler warning.
Bioshock infinite's best parts were story, but even then it didn't nail all of it. It toyed with various themes other games have not dared to touch (which is awesome) but it didn't nail them. It detailed certain problems within Columbia, but it never really did anything with them. Did the narrative really address the problems of racism or class division in Columbia, or connect them to religion, or to patriotism? No. It showed them, beautifully sure, but just as quick as we saw many of these issues we were rushed away to another, or moved on to the more relevant theme that was quantum mechanics. It's been talked to death, but narrative-dissonance was a big issue with Bioshock Infinite. And ultimately the story has a few inconsequential steps that seem to cater to these themes that (again) are not completely relevant to Booker, and Elizabeth's goals. 
Many people before have said that they felt as though the combat was just a barrier to get into more of the story. Unfortunately a good amount of the story itself is presented around combat and actual gameplay. Not just in level design, eg. "here is the working class area" but also in providing an excuse for combat. eg. "In this timeline the resistance force want you dead, because you were really helpful as a martyr, and it would hurt the resistance if people knew you were back (which doesn't make a lot of sense considering half of the resistance force is actively trying to kill you...)." Overall, Infinite has a good narrative, and the last 30 minutes or so are quite memorable, especially among fans of the previous Bioshock. But the game walks a fine line between catering to the reason for combat/gameplay, and the overhead plot, to its detriment.
I have and would continue to recommend Bioshock infinite because it is still a fun game. Combat is alright despite being largely static, and the world is beautiful even if the level design doesn't always take advantage the way it could. The narrative is fun to follow, and the end twist is great. But by no means is it the greatest game of all time, or even (in my opinion obviously) of 2013. 
So to make a long post short, ** Bioshock Infinite won't be considered the greatest game of all time (by at least a large amount of people) because it didn't nail anything. Combat was hit or miss but either way static the whole game, level design was too linear and unfortunately just complimented the underwhelming combat, and the narrative is weakened by walking a fine line between catering to the reason for combat/gameplay, or the actual narrative/overhead plot.**
Ugh. I don't hate Pac-Man so much as I hate how Namco uses him. It's like they treat him as if he's a big-shot character with a fanbase when really he's pretty much a vestigial icon. Sure there's plenty of old funky characters in Smash, but for the most part they're making a reappearance for just Smash, unlike Pac-Man who makes cameos like nobody else. He would feel weird in the cast, even moreso than Sonic and Snake, who were at least decent additions, though Sonic felt as tacked on as he actually was.
Basically I'm saying he would spoil the mood.
I actually like it and I'll explain why. When I close my eyes and take the voice out of context it sounds silly. However, I'm a big fan of Batman having a different voice than Bruce Wayne because otherwise I just have to suspend way too much disbelief that people don't know it's him.
Now why the laryngitis voice? Because it sounds demonic which fits in with Batman's whole theme of using fear as a weapon. It sounds goofy if you focus too much on it from your couch but imagine if you're some criminal and some huge guy is taking all your buddies out in the dark one by one then lifts you up off the ground and that's his voice. It'd be terrifying.
I also liked Bale's Bruce Wayne. His voice, facial expressions, and goddamn douche smile drip with so much fucking smugness and contempt that I can understand why nobody would even consider him as the Bats.
I'm not saying WW2 was about establishing a worldwide pancake distribution policy but it makes you wonder.
"Spawn" movie was fetid, the only redeeming part was John Leguizamo.  If your speaking about the "Spawn" serial on HBO, then i apologize, because it was way better than the movie we saw.
If you're talking about Image properties in gerneral...I would say that "The MAXX" on MTV was their boldest move.  They pretty much laid out the comic storyline in that show.
*TL:DR* What does the single word "Spawn" add to this?
Can I nominate that for the best ever?
Whatever happened to *UnrelatedTLDR* anyways?
It was 2000. My mother bought a PC and let me have a go on it. Me, being intrigued at the idea of being able to look at pictures of anything in the world just by typing it into this here worldwide picture box, I searched "boobies" and.... Wow.... LOOK AT ALL THESE BOOBIES.....Then thought "I wonder what happens if I type in Vagin..... WOW LOOK AT ALL THE VAGINAS AND BOOBIES".  I felt the strange urge to play with my willy. The feeling got more and more intense after about 5 minutes and eventually got too intense and I thought my dick was gonna snap off so I ran out of the room crying. 
 Searched for boobs, had first fap, got scared and cried.
I'm 18 now, when I was a child we basically lived in "the hood." So my parents never had enough money to buy a computer. I would occasionally see them at different stores or at a friends house, so I knew what they were. But when my dad finally got a job as a drug representative, and we moved to a nice neighborhood. He purchased the best damn computer he could. I remember, it was all white and bulky. My parents had been setting it up the entire day, and I hadn't had the chance to actually use it for weeks. I finally decided, instead of waiting for parental permission, I would wake up at 1:00 am and see what the hubbub was about. Luckily the computer was right outside of my room. I sat down in our big leather chair, took a deep breath and opened internet explorer. I was so excited I couldn't think of anything to search for, and my youthful mind got the better of me. I decided I would search "pee.com." I saw terrible things. It scarred me. I began to cry, and my parents rushed upstairs only to see a screen full of urinating dicks and vaginas. They were horrified and I was not allowed on the computer again for some years.
got excited and searched pee.com
I was on the internet in elementary school in 3rd grade looking up stuff for a project when my friendin my class told me to go to a website called Penthouse dot com. I knew what a penthouse was, having seen the word in books and stuff, but I didn't know what Penthouse dot com was. I trusted my friend so I went to the website, where I proceeded to see a busty lady with soap on her boobs. I exited out quickly. Surprisingly, I didn't get in trouble. 
** First internet experience turned out to be first porn experience thanks to my elementary school friend.**
The year is 1994.  To get an .mp3, I would have to click on 5 adult pages for the password.  The clue would be, "The first letter of the password is on the 1st paragraph, first letter of the second word.  The second letter of the password is on the 3rd paragraph, fifth word..." and on it would continue until you've visited all 5 adult sites just so you can get the password (and the host would get paid of course).  You then take this password, login into an ftp site.  There would you download several files each 1.4 megs (so they can fit in a floppy), then after you downloaded the files, you would unzip them, and then you would have your .mp3.  I remember having a 32 meg RIO MP3 player, that thing was the shit back in the day.    
I was very young at the time, and my father installed a "Net Nanny", so adult webpages would be blocked.  I remember trying to convince him that I was at the adult pages for passwords.  He did not believe me.

Nuzlocking has created a special place in my heart for the early evolving Bug-Type Pokemon like Beedrill and Dustox. They can really wreck everything in their path for at least the first 2 or 3 gyms in any generation because of their final evolution stats. I remember Opie the Beedrill from my first FireRed Nuzlocke. That dude didn't care about Brock's Rock Throw or Misty's Water Gun or even Lt. Surge's Raichu powerhouse.  He even helped me beat Erica and Sabrina. They couldn't stand up to his Twin Needle. Eventually he met his fate when I teamwiped to Blaine. I "buried" near where I caught him in Viridian City.
 Beedrill.
Well, best advice I can give you is apply in an area that is desperate for teachers.  They will likely have lower standards for their applicants.  For example, I worked in an office for a College of Ed. in the states and analyzed student performance for a great deal of my time there.  Our area is extremely desperate for teachers, and doesn't have much success finding them due to low pay.  There were countless undergrads in the program that barely passed the intro courses required before starting the program, or grads that had bad grades in undergrad (and in the grad program).  If you can basically ace whatever content knowledge exam(s) you need, that would look good, as well.  I know scoring in the top 15% basically gave you a free spot in our program.
 Grad schools are more likely to have lenient standards if they're in an area desperate for teachers.
Thats lucky! If I were your opponent I would have been so mad at myself.

OP hung his queen on 25...Qh2+
 "should" is a very hard thing to enforce. Should we exercise? give money to the poor? be nice people? We should do many things. A more practical question is "Does an immigrant need to learn the language of the country they move to?" 
The difficulty of the language is not really the major factor. The major factor is why should we learn the language in the first place. Language has GREAT economic and sociocultural incentives.
For the most part, most immigrants can speak the language of their native country. Consider how a immigrant arrives in the first place. They need a visa and most visas are granted through work or study, which requires language fluency. The majority of non-speaking immigrant are most likely family members/refugees or some other special cases. 
Having a community means there a subculture large enough that supports their sociocultural and economic needs in a foreign language. This eliminates many benefits and ultimate destroys their motivation. 
If most personal benefits are gone, then we must consider societal benefits.  Let's ignore a moral argument that all discrimination is bad and stay with an economic view. If no one accommodates immigrants, the inconvenience will motivate them to learn the language. Being completely reliant on a translator is costly and is insanely annoying. However, if the benefits outweigh the costs, most businesses will just incur a higher transaction cost and find ways to communicate (pictures, learning their language, etc). This balance is ultimately governed by market forces.
TLDR-they don't need to so why should they

I thought it was okay...Not really satisfying. I feel like they were trying to cram too much into that episode. There wasn't much going on inside Terminus because of all the flashbacks they showed. They could've done without all the symbolism and showed more of what was going on inside Terminus. Also, I resent the fact that they failed to leave zero closure when we have to wait 7 months for it to come back. Spoilers, obvs; I think the mid season finale with the Governor being killed was better. 
- Less flashbacks, more action, satisfying closure to wrap up a season.  
Mmhm. There was a pretty sweet booth at the Winter Antiques Show in NYC with some, and there's always the Morgan library here. 
 NYC is spoiled for museums and antiques dealers. 
Yes... I'm aware of that.  The show, however, demonstrates her being resistant to scalding water, red-hot coals, dragon fire, and good ol' candle flame.  Most fans who only watch the show believe that she's completely immune to fire/heat - and from what has been shown on TV... she is.  They even added a scene not from the book where Dany handles the dragon egg that burns Irri, but not her - so it's definitely not just the pyre.
The books, of course, don't have that - and my point was mainly that it would appear that TV Dany is significantly more fireproof than Book Dany. 
Because GRRM *does* happen to consult on the show, I would presume that this means that the issue of her fireproof-ness does not factor majorly into the future of the story, as that would create some serious dissonance between the books/show, the sudden need to ret-con or at least ret-explain significant aspects of the show, or some more deus-ex-magica.

TV Dany: fireproof; Book Dany: very lucky
We don't know if that matters yet.
A friend of mine from high school has a disorder where the blood vessels in his nostrils are much closer to the surface than normal.  As a result, he was extremely prone to bloody noses.  eventually, he figured out it was easy to cause them.  Whenever he wanted an excuse to leave class he'd just give his nose a firm "bonk" and like magic, bloody nose.  He even used this trick to get out of a speeding ticket.
friend used bloody nose disorder to skip class and get out of traffic tickets.
I don't think its that the younger generation "doesn't know any better'. Its just they don't give a shit?
Political apathy for starts is major problem and the fact that a fair amount of Japanese feel that they've done enough with regards to contrition (i.e. the various Treaties, reparations, AWF, apologies and ODA loans).

Not to mention you're now several generations removed from said atrocities and these kids were taught these crimes in a very dry manner. (A few pictures of dead bodies here, a few pages about how many non-combatants were killed and maybe a paragraph about comfort women). Although there are supplementary materials used by teachers (who are often derided as left wing for their attempts to stop schools from using "nationalist texts") to attempt to evoke empathy (like diaries and selected excerpts from testimonials), the fact that the atrocities are not tested on College Entrance exams really just makes students give less of a shit.
The vast majority of young Japanese (like young Americans) do not vote reliably (namely those Japanese born after 1982 as they were taught under the revised M.O.E policy of teaching war crimes as prior to that, WW2 was a bit whitewashed) And with regards to the rest of the electorate, given the 20  year slump they were in, would prioritize the economy/domestic issues above all else. So even if an LDP politician may hold debatable historical views, they'll still vote for him/her if they believe he'll "improve the economy" or revitalize an area.

Now that the fact that the electorate doesn't give a shit. Why should an scumbag politician not try to troll for easy votes in a steady, albeit somewhat small voting bloc of ultra-nationalists by going to Yasukuni or denying war crimes and showing his street cred of not kowtowing to foreign countries (pls vote 4me). You sure as hell aren't losing any regular votes by doing so. You having nothing to lose and everything to gain.
- students care only superficially or just don't give a shit. I mean, would you care? 
I think the ambiguous status of the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands played a role in all that. Territorial disputes are easy to dust under the rug when they're not in the spotlight. For example, Japan's dispute with Russia gets virtually zero media coverage (as well as the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute with S. Korea) nowadays. 
Essentially what Japan did with the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands is run up and slam their flag down on those rocks by allowing the sale of property. The history of how those islands became administered by Japan is also sort of sketchy, so China feels like they got screwed.
The CCP's central stance has traditionally been to right what they see have been the country's wrongs: being humiliated by western powers, creating a powerful united government that wasn't there under the Guomindang (rebel provinces, warlords, invasions by Japan), and of course territorial integrity after roughly a century of everyone carving out chunks of China.
China has history of being screwed, Japan did something foolish, not really surprising when you think about it.  
Long story short, USSR wasn't in the war until June of '41 and US was in in December of '41.
By that point, the Brits had been fighting the Germans *and* the Italians alone for a full year after France capitulated in '40.
Bear in mind, in this year, the Brits were fighting the Germans/Italians all over the Mediterranean (Malta, Crete, Greece, etc), Middle East (Iraq mostly), North Africa and in the Battle of Britain. 
The simple fact of the matter is, if the Brits had been defeated the Soviets never would have received the thousands of planes/trucks that they got from the US nor would the US have had a launching point for invasions of North Africa and Europe. 
Manpower (couple hundred thousand Germans tied up in Mediterranean theater) wasn't the key issue, it was the number of armored vehicles and particularly aircraft that were being used. Had those men and especially those tanks/aircraft been available for Barbarossa perhaps that theater might have gone differently.
To me, it *all starts* with the Brits standing alone for a full year against the Germans/Italians in multiple fronts.
No, you miss the point *entirely*. I chose to live in Germany because it's a stable and safe society and I enjoy those things. Who wouldn't?? 
I'm talking about the ethnocentric and frankly short-sighted view that "borders are a good thing" when it was those very borders which created the disparity between countries in the first place. Unless you mean to infer that Germans/Europeans/whatever are intrinsically inclined to create a more stable society than central Africans would, in which point I could label you a racist.
Yeah, borders and border security are so frigging awesome arresting or shooting Mexicans making a run for it is *super cool*....except when a piece of land outside your own has something you really need (most often oil), then we can put aside the notion of borders and sovereignty until further notice.
fuck borders
No reparations should be required.  The only exception being the Swiss banks that held onto money that was not theirs to retain.
If Japan is still paying reparations, that is absurd.  Additionally, if Japan chooses to rearm, why not?
My only request, is that Japan &amp; the Japanese be honest about the past.  As a Westerner I will always acknowledge that during WW2 the BE allowed millions to starve in India/Pakistan/Bangladesh; that the murder of Japanese POWs was SOP; our failure to bomb the railway to Auschwitz was shameful; and bombing was essentially a war crime.  If politicians try to whitewash history, I would stand up and protest as the Japanese historians did recently.
And as a citizen of a great country, you can be proud of your awesome &amp; honest historians.  
Agreed, reparations now are silly.  Japan should rearm. Historical honesty is v important, that is my main point.

I also keep changing up my armor from light to heavy and back again depending on the loot I get. I also keep swapping out skills as I change from single target ranged/AoE melee and AoE ranged/single target melee. I've squandered Skill Points into weapons I don't even use all the time. One time put a couple Skill Points into Restoration so I could heal in a dungeon (and then midway through the dungeon I picked up a strong Destro Staff and equipped that instead, lol). Despite all that, I've remained effective and have had a ton of fun playing any way I want to at any time. 
- I'm A.D.D. and indecisive, and I've never had more fun! 
Besides Obamacare and a few other things, not a whole lot. The President doesn't have half the power the American people believe he does. Not saying he's not a powerful man, just that it seems that the general populace had a tendency to view him on a dictator level of power.  We tend to blame him for everything instead of looking towards the root of the problem. Don't like the laws that have been passed lately? Try voting your Congressman/Congresswoman and house reps out of office. Do some research on who is keeping their promises and who voted what into existence. 
 The President is not a dictator. Blame the House, Congress, and the President as a whole.
In the end, we'd end up paying the same for less channels. Channels only cost a few dollars each a month b/c all subscribers are forced to purchase them. When users can pick or choose, the cost for a channel will be distributed amongst a smaller group, driving the price up. Oh, and large providers will still bundle their channels (want ESPN? Then take ESPN's package with ESPN Ocho! Want The Food Network? That requires a subscription to Scripps' package). And let's not forget all of this will be on top of the cable provider's fees for running the line to your house.
 ala carte programming won't reduce your cable bill to $10/month b/c you tend to only watch 5 channels.
&gt; The extant manuscripts of the writings of the 1st century Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus include references to Jesus and the origins of Christianity.[1][2] Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, written around 93–94 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus Christ in Books 18 and 20 and a reference to John the Baptist in Book 18.[1][3] - [**Wikipedia**](
Note that the book in question, *Antiquities of the Jews* only includes two references, and was written around 93-94 AD, which was some 60 years after the alleged death of Jesus. He's not a contemporary, and is writing third-hand information received from other people.
From an article titled [***Josephus on Jesus***]( from Princeton's website:
&gt;There is broad scholarly consensus that the two passages referring respectively to John the Baptist, and to James the brother of Jesus are genuine. A third passage, the famous Testimonium Flavianum found in the Antiquities of the Jews 18.63-64, in its current form summarises the ministry and death of Jesus; but the authenticity of this passage remains contested by many scholars, and has been the topic of ongoing debate since the 17th century. The most widely held current scholarly opinion is that the Testimonium Flavianum is partially authentic; but that those words and phrases that correspond with standard Christian formulae are additions from a Christian copyist.
&gt;
&gt;In those parts of the Testimonium that are commonly regarded as authentic, Josephus describes Jesus as a teacher and miracle worker, attracting a large following who revered him after his death; but, other than James, Josephus names none of the founders of the Church such as St. Paul, St.Peter or any the Twelve Apostles, nor does he refer to basic Christian doctrines, such as the Virgin Birth, the Incarnation or the Atonement, which has led some to suggest that Josephus may have been an Ebionite Christian.
 Josephus was not a contemporary of Jesus, though he was a contemporary of the early Christian cult (and possibly a member of one of it's earliest sects.) He wrote third-hand of Jesus about 60 years after the death of the man. His passages relating to Jesus, the Testimonium Flavianum, is highly contested by scholars and has been since the 17th century. The Testimonium shows signs of forgery by later Christian copyists. He's not a good historical source as a result.
Edit: there are other aspects of his writings that are considered pretty authentic, it's primarily the ones that deal with Jesus that show the greatest signs of having been forged.
please note that this is a world of wonder production, I.E. they're doing as much as possible with the little they have. so they probably shot ALL of these ruview videos in the course of two or three days. obviously it's expected for them to have some sort of different outfit on every new video, but honestly? if I were them, I wouldn't be bothered either tbh. actually, it probably saved the production team time since their outfit/wig changes were probably really quick. 
also, knowing about fashion and wearing good clothes are too different things. Grace Coddington being a prime example. she helps run one of the most successful fashion magazines daily, but she always looks like she's going to a lutheran funeral.
they grown women and they can do whateva they want
Yes!! That pisses me off! I also get a lot of guys who ask a million personal questions, but never provide any actual answers of their own. You know, usually when someone asks "What's your favorite movie?" (to pull a totally random and conversationally appropriate non-creeper example out of the air), after I answer they'll either say "Oh, I love that one!" or "Oh, cool! Mine's [Movie]." Instead, they never volunteer their own info, and just keep asking me things, so instead of a conversation it's an interrogation. And once again, I feel like I'm doing all the work, spilling my guts and baring my soul and he just eats it up, and I'm none the wiser about my conversational partner. Needless to say, I've wised up a bit, and am not so free with my replies as I once was.
 some people need to learn to converse. &gt;:/
&gt;one person should not be able to compel another to do something they don't want to protect the first person. That is simply tyranny.
Like it or not you are a participant in society.  You do not live in a bubble where your actions do not have both direct or indirect consequences and risks to those around you.  In the case of irresponsible vaccination a deadly risk.
You have rights yes, but don't forget you are not the only member of society.  So other people have rights to.  The most fundamental right above all else is a right to life.  Certain rights take precedence over other rights.  In this case the right to life for others takes precedence over your right to make an ignorant choice.
This is a clear case where 2 rights can conflict with each other.  Your fundamental right to choose in regards to your own body or your children, dangers the fundamental right to life of those around you/your children.  In this case whose right do we respect more?  The right of personal choice or the right of life?
Also Children have rights independent of their parents.  So even based on ignorance as you claim why does the parents right of ignorance supersede the childs right to safe health?  We've already seen with cases of Faith-healing that parents have an obligation to their children to keep them as safe and healthy as possible.  If they are willfully and ignorantly denying their child access to vaccinations which keep them healthy and prevent deadly diseases then they are not fulfilling their obligation to their child and again they're forcing their personal right of choice to take precedence over the personal right of life of others.
You do not have a greater right to choose to endanger the lives of those around you than those people have a right to not be endangered by choice.
**tldr**  Peoples right to life should not take second place to right of choice.
I think your idea works. There really is no way to play cyborg in dnd, so if the OP can't switch systems but wants to play Adam Jensen, that would work. Soul of someone who's physical body dies but who's soul is transferred to empty warforged body us thematically almost identical to story that Adam goes trough. 
When it comes to rules... You got two options: 
1: Full warforged body: Use full warforged rules. Every one you meet has no reason to believe you are actually human, they might treat you weirdly.
2. Some original biotic body remaining (like upper torso and head) so you can disguise yourself as (albeit tall) human. You don't get charisma penalty warforged get and you get their bonuses. You however lose those bonuses warforged get because they are living constructs like need to not eat, breathe and sleep like biological races. 
Backstory need explanation; who turned you into warforged and why? They might not be alive anymore but Adam still needs to find his loved one. Prob the organisation might be the House that originally made warforged in The War and Adam was a rogue project during the War. If the campaign is in Eberron I mean. 
 If you want to play actual cyborg with rules and all you need to switch systems. If all you want is the theme "man within machine, I didnt ask for this" go with something like human soul in warforged vessel.
I'll try to convey why i DID enjoy it, and not run on too long. And for context, I'm not a humongous comic book head... although I can certainly watch a comic book movie or read one from time to time. I was a theater/film major in school, I work in post production and I enjoy a lot of different movies, all over the board. I love a lot of weirdo art films that I can't get anyone else i know to watch, and I also enjoy the works of Will Ferrel, if that helps to illustrate my spectrum.  
First, to your critiques... it's a comic book movie, and a Judge Dredd movie at that... I'm not looking for incredible character development here (Dredd himself is really an extreme one note character: 'badass' and either you like that or you don't), nor a super complex story out of this movie. And so I turned off my always-on-hyper-analytical side that ruins the outcome of TV dramas for my wife halfway through when I predict everything that's going to happen note for note. I just went in looking to be entertained. And I was, because:  
1. I found great tension in the film. Granted it felt a little lifted from "The Raid" but i thought closing off the apartment complex was a great way to keep the action going, and ratchet up tension since all parties were contained within a confined space. That sense of dramatic claustrophobia, I felt, was palpable.   
2. It wasn't insipid pg-13 nonsense. This was an action movie for adults. It didn't hold back, it was gritty and brutal. It was mean. I liked that. It was a throwback to a time when many more action movies were made this way; not censoring themselves to the point where the reality of the dangerous, cut throat and unforgiving environment they're trying to create is completely undermined by how much they have to cut out, how little brutality they can actually convey. This movie has a *hard* 'R' rating and it showed. For me, it was a nice counter balance to all the other pg 13 comic book movies that straddle a very careful line about what they can show, and the world they can portray.  
3. Urban's performance was excellent. He did justice (no pun intended) to a character that was completely maligned by the last movie iteration. Between keeping that helmet on all the time and the bottled up seething rage he managed to emote from the nose down... i found him pretty hard to look away from onscreen.   
...there's plenty more, but I'm starting to ramble. I hope this was somewhat useful.   
*** - i had a great time in the theater seeing it, thought the 3D was the best application of that technology I'd seen thus far. 
I had a whole research process, data to collect, variables to rank, I spent months on it (during whcih I had a nervous breakdown and almost had to be hospitalized).
Finally, I googled 4 therapists close to me. Started calling and made an appointment with the first one who answered. It worked just fine. 
tl/dr: google "therapists in my city". pick the first one and call. Repeat. 
Easiest way to improve your MMR would be to realise you had problems early in the game, like a walking courier well past the 10 min mark, and rectified them then. Buy wards if you need to, and point out that wards need to be purchased. Indicate dangers to your pubmates or point out runes.
communicate and pick up slack if you have to
I feel similar, when I was getting my MMR ranking for solo play, I didn't have a single game where my teammates stayed till the end. Every single game I played had an abandon, and I got placed low 2k MMR. Obviously lost every match. Since ive gottten it up to mid 3k, but it took a lot of work. This low MMR trench is sometimes true, I find the lower the MMR the more likely my team is to either throw or just abandon. Your best bet is to stick to it, play heroes that can either dominate solo (slark, prophet, etc) or a good support hero (WD, CM, Visage (if you have good micro skills)). Once you get higher up and can actually create solid team compositions, its best to play whatever role is missing. I found low 2k rank was full of 3 mid heroes and a hard carry, leaving me most often as the only support. Team composition knowledge is very limited at low levels, so try to play whatever is needed. Another (last) tip is to try to jungle. Often I found my lanes were.... well complete shit to be honest. Very agressive players who end up feeding, etc. If I was left to my own devices for 15 mins as prophet in the jungle, I could come out with a necro 3, midas, and just fuck all their towers nearly instantly, giving my whole team a gold bonus. 
Sorry for the wall of text.
 Play what the team needs, farm a fuck ton if your hero needs it, and slowly work your way out of it.
Count the calories. Plan you meals ahead of time. Try eating 5 or 6 smaller meals a day. Or alternatively bulk up on liquids between 4 meals. Although it feels like you are eating more than everyone else this is likely just you eating larger portions than them but less meals. try 5-6 meals and decreased portion size, or increase liquid calories in addition to meals.
At the time, BJ was regarded as the most dangerous grappler in the division: his last two wins were against Renzo &amp; Rodrigo Gracie, and before that he choked Duane Ludwig, Matt Hughes, and Takanori Gomi to victory. 
His only recent loss was to Lyoto Machida (a split decision). Danaher was certain that GSP could beat him on the ground. He was alone on this thought -- his logic was that BJ was never strong bottom player, he's never submitted anyone from the bottom. Rather, BJ is an incredible top player.
So he wanted GSP to push Penn to the fence, put Penn on the ground, and win through ground and pound. He believed early that one of GSP's greatest strength was to put people down and control them there. He had an exceptional ability to avoid submissions and put on "ferocious ground-and-pound". 
He called this "a happy marriage between Georges' best skills and BJ's weaknesses."
Danaher was the new guy in GSP's camp, and they wouldn't allow Danaher to test the theory. They thought he was out of his mind, and explicitly told him so. So in the end they decided that GSP would go out and try to strike. 
But Penn is an exceptional boxer, whose counterpunching style matches up badly with GSP's underdeveloped punching game. He was not confident that GSP would win in punching exchanges.
So he said to the camp... Direct passage from The Way of the Fight
&gt;"How about we use your strategy for the first round, and if it works, we'll keep going with it? If it doesn't work, we'll switch to my strategy. -- They agreed. Now as history recalls, Georges took a terrible shellacking in that first round. He got poked very severely in the eye early in the fight, and his straight style of punching was easily countered with Penn's jabs and counterpunching. 
&gt;When Georges came back into the corner at the end of that first round, he looked like a completely beaten man. He sat down for a short time of rest. Somewhere in that minute he found his strength and I Looked at him. I said, 'Georges, you know what you have to do.' He turned his head up and looked straight at me. I remember he wiped the blood off his face and nodded. He didn't say a word. He rose, and he immediately drove BJ Penn to the fence, right there in front of me. We called out the precise elements we had drilled in New York City -- based on risk control and dropping to a leg -- and famously Georges took BJ down on several occasions. Of course, he easily survived on the ground and Penn never got close to a submission. Georges dominated the next two rounds and won a narrow decision. 
&gt;If we had used my strategy from the start, it would have been an easy victory, 3-0. But I learned alot about Georges that fight, something that went far beyond the technical level and into his heart. Even with that terrible start, he still came through, two rounds to one. He showed impressive courage, and I got to see his shootbox skills firsthand against, at the time, one of the greatest martial artists in the world. 
&gt;It was surprising to the naive, to those who understand strategy and BJ Penn, there was nothing surprising about it. It was simply observation of what should have been obvious facts. But most people overlook obvious facts."
 Danaher was the new guy in GSP's camp, told GSP to take BJ down and g&amp;p, camp thought he was crazy, but it turned out he was right. 
All of the Danaher passages in the book are as awesome and epic as this. 
I setup ATT next for my wife and son on their two iPhone 5S devices. Its only 25 a month for each phone which I don't think is too horrible however not actually owning the device would drive me crazy. Even after 18 months they don't "own" the phone but can trade it in for another if they so choose. Only after keeping it for I believe 24 months does it actually become there's to keep and the payments stop. I got my Lumia on a 2 year contract but I'm not paying monthly for it. I feel more comfortable going that route than the next route. 
Tldr. I would get it off eBay. Its a Nokia so you know its probably fine since its a effin tank.
Ok I'm commenting here as a victim of child abuse (the kind that's supposed to destroy you for the rest of your life). The spankings in most states are completely legal. Unless there is bruising, the parents will get away with it. You haven't really described your sister's behavior at all, though I sort of wonder if she might be provoking some of these responses. I want to clarify though, that I in no way find them ok. I believe that for the most part it does seem like emotional abuse (but that is harder to prove than physical). Your parents do seem older and might possibly have less patience with your sister. Your sister may also be high needs. Again this doesn't excuse their behavior. I'm going to go against the grain and say hold off on calling CPS. In my personal experience, there is not much in the above statements that they would be able to work with. There's no physical evidence of abuse. Here's what I would do first:
Call a family meeting. With ALL members that currently live in the household, including both of your sisters. Calmly explain to your parents the behaviors that you've seen them exhibit. Do not get overly emotional, scream at them, etc or they will not listen (I'm a parent of an extremely whiny 11 yr old, I tune her out when she whines). More than likely they might jump up and be defensive (I know I am) and claim to have reasonings for it. Tell them your concerns. Offer to help out more with her. I'm sorry but you're 17 and as a lot of people pointed out practically an adult. I know that you probably have school and college to think about, but being more proactive in your family (which I haven't seen anything that indicates you are, your entire statement seems like you are watching everything occur as a bystandard) can really help out. 
Also with their ages possibly contributing to their sour attitude, are either of them disabled in any way? Hearing, mobility, sight, anything? That could also be something to take into consideration.
 Don't call CPS yet, but try stepping up and talking to your parents about their behaviors/attitude towards your sister.
Typically when you see trucks roll over it's because of a massive cross wind hitting the trailer because there is more surface area and air can easily get under the trailer. Your average truck has a low center of mass and air can't get under it easily. I don't think the truck is more likely to roll with a trailer because trailer are already extremely susceptible to rollover so it will go first. But obviously a lighter truck wouldn't be able to keep it down like a heavier one. So if the trailer does roll the lighter truck is more likely to go with.
BUT!
When you are bobtail its a different story. Just the truck by itself would be more susceptible to rollover than a heavier one. Same surface area and less weight.
Trailers are worse in wind than a lightened truck. But a lightened truck is worse by itself than a regular one.
I don't think *anyone in this thread* read the article. Yet again, it's a bunch of knee-jerk dumbasses prattling off about a misinformation centric headline.
This isn't about the Canadian government wanting to butt the US out of surveying Canadian citizens for the citizens rights and sovereignty... it's wanting to ensure that only Canadian companies get the contracts for hardware and maintenance for the monitoring of their *own* citizens in the same way the US would be.
You don't like the NSA? Oh, fine, CSEC is *just as good.* No citizen of any developed nation has any semblance of privacy. All nations spy on themselves and each other and select nations share that information. 
Canada doesn't want to give US companies the contracts for CSEC's own brand of digital surveillance. 
I have am a recent lancero convert.  I had the LFD Double Ligero as my first lancero, at the behest of my Greek friend John.  According to him, in Europe the lancero is considered the "Gentlemen's Cigar" not overly large and "obnoxious," as he put it, as the cigars Americans are accustomed to seeing.  That being said, I really enjoy the lanceros as the wrapper (the finest leaf that can be grown, theoretically) plays so much more into the flavor of the cigar.  I'll use the My Father as an example.  I have had the My Father No. 4 (lancero) and the My Father No. 5 (toro.)  I find the lancero to have a much "creamier" smoke, it has a much cooler and thicker mouthfeel than the smoke from the No. 5.  The length of the lancero, I believe, is what plays into the smoke feeling "cooler" it has much more tobacco to be drawn through before it reaches your mouth, and consequently has that much more tobacco to "absorb?" flavors from.  From a flavor stand point, the No. 5 is an excellent cigar, it is sweet, woodsy, leathery, and a little spicy, a very well balanced cigar.  The No. 4 is much the same animal, flavor wise, but it is a whole other beast when we talk about intensity of flavor.  Every nuance of every flavor you can pick out is present.  The smaller ring gauge lets the wrapper do the talking and the length makes the smoke so cool and sweet I can hardly believe they are the same cigar.  
The lancero vitola is becoming more prevelant, as far as I can tell.  The ones I can recommend are as follows:
LFD Double Ligero (absolute pepper bomb, incredibly intense)
Headley Grange Drumstick (cool, creamy, sweet cedar with an almsot caramel flavor)
Tatuaje 10 Miami (their 10th anniversary offering, smooth, spicy, oaky with smoke so thick you can almost chew it, so good in fact, this is the cigar I smoke on my wedding day)
I hope every one enjoys my lancero ramblings.  I'm not the most well spoken or experienced aficionadoh here,  that's just my 2 cents.
 Read the goddamn post! 
Edit: I have to edit to say that my favorite lancero is the LFD Double Ligero
People keep posting here that Jester Thomas is the new Tarkus, but Tarkus could easily kill the Iron Golem by himself.  I've fought Mytha plenty of times so I decided to see what everyone was talking about and summoned him.  After hitting Mytha a few times, I decided to see if Jester Thomas could kill her by himself.  It got down to one last hit on Mytha and a few hits left on Jester Thomas and he missed a Forbidden Sun, then got interrupted multiple casts in a row, then missed another Forbidden Sun before Mytha killed him.  Hell, this happened on NG and I helped him deal some damage to her before letting them duel.
 Jester Thomas is not nearly as badass as Black Iron Tarkus was.
I can't say for sure, but I think it's probably because intense fear of spiders isn't actually based on their evil mastermind superpowers or anything rational. Yeah, some are venomous, but for many it's just a visceral "ugh *no*" knee jerk reaction that is largely visual. So seeing them in games produces the same reaction for some people, plus in games they are usually significantly more lethal and aggressive than real life.
*** spiders be nasty in any format
Honestly, I would despise the concept of it. I know Nintendo would probably pull it off, but the entire point of Zelda is that Link is the hero traditionally with a sword. Modern would no doubt mean that some of the characters would have guns, which is not what the base core of Zelda is. It's set in (I think) medieval times with their technology and their mindset, not the modern day with our mindset. A modern day Zelda game would be taking away the charm of the games we know and love. The Heroes Bow would have sights and would not be the Bow that we know and love. The slingshot would probably be wrist mounted, not the simple Y-shaped stick that Ocarina of Time introduced.

 I hate it because it wouldn't be Zelda.
You would be amazed, sometimes stuff like this works.
I was in an Advanced Placement Calc class my last year of high school(2002-2003). I have illegible hand writing form a learning disability and all homework was briefly checked by the teacher to insure completion. I also had the iron belief that homework was not to take more then two pages, because this shit was assigned every day.
The end result was that I would hand over one to two pages of mad man scrawl and everyone else in class would turn in four to eight beautifully formatted pages. After about three weeks the teacher no longer checked my home work because I was always right. Some of my class mates hated this because  I seemed to be getting away with bullshit but when AP test time came around I earned credit for two semesters of collage calc from a calc class where I was never graded on homework. 
sometimes trust works in a class.  
Wiley Plus is the same shit. I NEED EVERY FUCKING POINT OK, 3 CS LANGUAGES AND TRIG, PLUS 2 MORE BULLSHIT CLASSES AND THIS FUCKING GUY, MR. COMPUTER FUCKING I AM THE FINAL SAY OF EVERYTHING MATH. FUCK YOU GUY.

FUCK YOU GUY.
TL/DR: Sincerely everyfuckingbody.com/fuckyourmomimtryingmyassoff.png
This fucker... I had so much trouble with this program, but I never took a class that used it.
What's that you say?
About me: A little less than a decade ago, I got a Bachelor's in math. Meaning, I never took any of the classes that are taught by a computer b/c I wouldn't have gotten credit for them...
Anyway... Several of my friend's were on the 10-year plan when it came to college, and intermediate Algebra( yes, the remediation one, not for credit) proved to be a hurdle for someone who'd been out of high school for 7 or 8 years. They asked for my help, I drank their beer, it was a nightmare.
I remember specifically complex numbers. I happen to be pretty good with imaginary numbers, and the answer to one problem was 8*i*. NOPE! Oh, sure, 8*i* was the answer *eventually*, but we had to go through several levels of bullshit to get to it. The program even went as far as to say,"Yes, 8*i* is the correct answer, but we need to see how you arrived at it." I suppose that Mathlab just assumes you suck at math, which was a good assumption in my friend's case, just didn't think I'd get caught in it too.
Also, Parenthesis!
**Mathlab sucks, even if you're good at math.**
Not as bad as yours OP, but I was at a birthday party in 7th grade and felt a big ol booger in my nose. So I go into the next room to pick it, (because I was sitting by the birthday boy while he was opening his presents) I was deep in there to when the dog walks past me and bumps my arm. Well that shoved my finger at an angle which made me cut the inside of my nose with my fingernail. Then the immense amount of blood came.
Fuck. 
So I walk back into the room trying to get some damn help. As it turns out, a 7th grader with blood pouring out of his nose is pretty fucking terrifying.
Parents had to come get their children because the host parents almost broke down when they saw how much blood there was. So I kinda ruined the party, the fucker got Moon Shoes anyways so it couldn't have been that bad.

 I ruined a 7th grade party because I picked my nose.
I have a few that would fit into this but this one is by far the most ridiculous.
When I was 16, I wrote a frustrated story about my dad's alcoholism (which has been an off and on problem for years) and my much older sisters acceptance of it and how I was being treated on a particular day after coming home from school. It was something you would find on /r/offmychest today but this was a couple years before Reddit existed.
I never posted it online and I got over it but months later my sister went to clean my computer without asking me and found it, emailed it to my dad and he, for the first and only time, got physical as a drunk and started hitting me and slamming me against the wall and yelling at me for posting shit about him on the internet. His force wasn't particularly hard but this was really alarming and uncharacteristic of him. 
When my mom found out later that night, it turned into a nasty domestic fight and the cops had to be called. My mom actually snapped and pushed him off a chair but we lied and just said my dad was drunk and needed to be restrained (we left out all the violence). It was horrifying and probably the worst day of my life.
My dad went to rehab over Christmas/New Years and before the holidays he sent us a really nice letter apologizing and promising he will get better. My sister picked him up after the 30 days and he was apparently irate and crazed. I never got to see him because my sister (who he was moving in with till we could figure out if he was safe to come home) kicked him out after he started drinking again and he went and moved into a hotel. We filed a restraining order.
6 weeks later my mom was in the process of filing for divorce when my dad was found dead in his hotel room from his 4th heart attack (apparently, there was actually a possibility for a while that he was murdered by a prostitute). This was kept quiet outside of the inner circle of the family and we have lived with the lie till this day that he simply died of his 4th heart attack and there was no domestic abuse or divorce involved.
We find out later that days before he died he reached out to an old family friend, apparently sober, asking for help but the friend's daughter urged her not to help him (and thus was really torn up afterwards about it).
Anyways, this whole situation had other ramifications but it would be useless for me to list them as it's hard to see where the butterfly effect ends.
** I wrote a word file in preparation to vent on the internet about my home life that lead to my family being ripped apart and my dad dying in a hotel room.**
I think its alright for there to be a map pool split between NA/EU. Yes it is CS, but I nor 90% of the NA player base will ever play a competitive game against EU. Even fewer will play at the level where the differences in the two maps will actually matter. Also, right before the switch, Alt-pug was running valve train and valve mirage. CEVO switched largely because they seem to move at a faster pace than ESEA (Or at the very least adapt sooner). They are also the "entry level league" Players looking to get into leagues for the first time usually end up in cevo, not esea. So using Valve maps makes sense for them.
When ESEA switched (the only reason I can think of is they already have issues getting the EU teams on NA soil, different maps would just be another reason for them to not come) that is when AltPug switched over. I have no clue what there intentions were for that, maybe it was to draw some players out of esea (worked for me but I still sub to esea). 
As for Valve mirage, I do honestly believe it is a good map. I just feel as if _CE is better. My main beef with it is how long it takes, and how precise you have to be with most mid smokes. I understand the game needs to look nice to draw in spectators, I just dont feel as if removing/making smokes less useful is a fair trade off.

And as a side note. Pre-2001 there was actually a HUGE split between EU and NA. NA played the traditional MR format we are used to, while EU played Chargers Only. The only way you could score rounds, was on the terrorist side. CT's did not score points. This was changed after 9/11 for obvious reasons. So, even if the map pool was different, it would still be less fractured than it was at one point. 

 
Its not really a huge deal, I just prefer playing on _CE
Yes this closed-loop cooler will be much louder. Performance-wise it should cool just as good as the best air-cooler (Noctua NH-D14) (so significantly better than hyper212) but louder. 
BUT If you're not into hardcore(-ish) OC then you don't need it.
 If you're not sure you need it. You don't need it.
While you are getting down votes by people who think you are being alarmist I will answer your question:
Probably not. However this doesn't preclude a future filovirus like Ebola being widely spread via the "air". The Reston virus (an Ebola subtype) was very highly suspected to be passing from monkey to monkey without physical contact when it was first discovered in the 90s. Though in this case the Virus seems to not be pathogenic to humans.
Further evidence has also been found that the pig to non-human primate jump can be made without direct contact for some Ebola subtypes.
 don't worry that this particular outbreak will become "airborne" but academically there definitely is concern that a pathogenic, easily spread filovirus could arise someday.
I'm against tipping being expected.
***hear me out!*** That's not to say I'm against tipping in general, somebody puts a little extra in their job they deserve a bit extra in return. On top of that I've got food allergies that admitedly makes some places jump through hoops, that alone is usually reason enough to tip.
What I'm against is the idea that you should tip for anything better than bad service. 
I'm well aware of how little waiters/waitresses get paid and that they're technically paid less than minimum wage(unless the tips don't cover the difference) But you know what I say to that? ***fix the system then!***
Feel free to disregard me as an asshole now.
I tip, but I hate the idea that tipping is expected no matter what.
I would get a little more experence before hosting. Make sure everything works before had aswell. There's also some good hosting FAQ and hosting rules you **NEED** to read over before you even start to think about hosting. 
 Try to get a little more invigorated in the community before you host your first game.
I don't know, are they? Do you know of any examples of China provoking Japan to the degree of Japanese prime minister visiting war criminals' shrine/memorial? All I'm saying is Japan should just stop with their nationalistic agendas that could start controversies. Then if something bad happens they are asking us to clean up the mess, we are not doing that b/c we are not their fucking tool, that's what I'm saying.
 Japan, just stfu and behave yourselves b/c we are not your tool and we won't clean up after your mess.
I am an older guy and I would have to answer your question of whether your male friends will change as you get older as yes and no.

First, you find men at a unique time in our history. In my opinion, there is a male identity crisis that few people acknowledge or want to discuss. With the progress that women have made and the changes in society as a result, many men have no base from which to view themselves as men (and consequently as adults).
I would argue that for centuries, men have operated as defenders and supporters of women and children. Our roles as supporters and defenders of women are fairly gone. Additionally, we have no rites of passage to signify a point at which to start being "men" (whatever that is). 
Things like buying houses, cars, and having children are associated with our role as men from an era that no longer benefits us when tied to no purpose other than to do for women and children things they no longer want or need from us. 
Until men have a reason to pursue bigger goals than immediate gratification many of us will continue to pursue just that. Until we create a new identity that is either entirely male focused or complimentary to the new goals of women, we will find no purpose in doing the things our fathers considered the office of men.

Many men still follow the old paths that defined manhood. I am former Air Force and still work with them as a civilian. I know plenty of men who are millionaires and are focused on houses, family and business pursuits of all types. Seek them out if you want, they are not very hard to find, although, they may be "older" men in general.
Those males who are on Reddit, social media, video games, smoking weed, poor or otherwise non-traditional, are doing no more than they feel society requests of them. They feel they owe society nothing. They feel society has given them nothing. They have no other identity and feel they don't belong. They cannot and have not adjusted to a system that wants to jail them, control them, constrain them and use them as cannon fodder or muscle for the machine.
Suffice it to say, that your unambitious male friends are in a proverbial wilderness. they are as lost as the Hebrew slaves who had been given their freedom (I am not a christian myself).There is a good chance many of them will die young, penniless, childless and with little support.
We are in a process of undoing a social order that took centuries to create. Males in general will adapt, but I believe it will be a long long time before we see a settled new world "Man". In the mean time, I would suggest you learn to embrace ambiguity. Our spirits are broken. Give us a few decades of failure to get back on a different horse please.
Men will eventually regain a workable identity. You exist in a time when men are creating a new identity and have no ancient path to follow.  
This is really going to depend on the context of the environment.   All cis gay men to some extent are hypersexualized by society as a way to dehumanize and objectify them.   That's where all of the "no homo" and "predatory gay" stereotype stuff comes from and Asian American communities are no exception to this.   If you're a gay guy in America, regardless of your race, you are going to have to deal with people prying about your personal life and even asking really inappropriate questions about your sex life.  It is really uncomfortable and messed up.
As part of orientalist stereotypes, yes, in modern American society Asian men in general are currently racialized as asexual, but IMHO this is primarily applicable to straight passing Asian men.   Furthermore, this "emasculation" of Asian men is done to fuel white patriarchal ego--these asexualizing stereotypes fuel colonialist fantasies and myths.   On the  other hand, in a lot of gay circles, gay Asian men tend to be hypersexualized the way Asian women are.  Just look at the exotifying and dehumanizing way Asian men are depicted in gay porn.
- you are asking if dehumanizing stereotypes "work in favor" for gay Asian men.   How could a flattening and dehumanizing stereotype ever truly work "in favor" for anybody?    Unfortunately, Asian American queer folk have to deal with a double whammy (in some cases, a triple whammy) of intersecting stereotypes for being both queer and Asian.
I assume you mean honeybees specifically as they are the major commercial pollinator? Basically, because we have so many of them. In the US for example, the western honeybee is a non-native species, and in a lot of cases there are native bees (bumblebees or solitary bees for example) or some flies or other beasties that are more efficient at pollinating certain plants than honeybees (honeybees are pants at pollinating tomatoes for example). That being said, honeybees come in a nice package of a number of thousand workers in a hive, that hive can be made to split, creating new hives and can (maybe not should) be moved around to where needs pollination at that time, so they are able to be used by us for pollination, rather than just hoping nature takes its course.
We are dependent on bees because we have domesticated bees for the purpose of pollination.
Don't miss out on non-FFG-games! This fall/summer/whenever AEG is reprinting **[Doomtown]( It's a western themed game which plays with 2+ players, so no more waiting for that odd out player at your Netrunner nights! If you want to know about the setting then you should definetly watch **[The Quick and the Dead]( (which is a freaking awesome movie!).
***
**Game of Thrones** is a great game for two, but it can be a bit complex. If you want to get into this, find a friend and play the [HBO edition]( and play it with said friend. It's dirt cheap on the BGG Marketplace.
***
**Call of Cthulhu** is a game for 2-4. There are a few 3+ player variants, but I've heard that the "french variant" is the best and FFGs own is pretty bad in comparison. Building economy in this game works like MtG with a nice twist. Instead of having to draw lands you get to place one card per turn of your desired color as an economy card. Nifty solution (The Spoils does something similar). And also: monsters!!
***
**Star Wars: The Card Game** is about placing dudes and killing the other guys dudes. Has a moderate amount of bluffing and deck building is kind of limited, but that makes it a great beginners game. There's an expansion which allows games of 3-4 players but I haven't it yet. Seems pretty cool.
***
**Lord of the Rings: The Card Game** - I have a friend who is really intelligent but only plays RPGs because in winning games there usually has to be some sort of foul play involved (he gets enough of assholery in real life, no need to taint his hobbies with it). When I showed him LotR he said "Damn it! If it didn't happend! You actually showed me a game I really like!". Co-op games usually sucks ass, but this is one of those rare occurances where it's extremely good. Plays with 1-4, but 3 is probably the best.
***
**Warhammer** - which one? **WH: Invasion** is "done". Some MtG player told me that that one was broken but idunno. The new one, **WH40K: Conquest** might be cool. But I'm not as much a sucker for that universe as some might be...
***
**TLDR**: Buy the HBO Version of Game of Thrones and play that a lot. Get the LotR core set and play a few times and then watch The Quick and the Dead so that you know that you will have to get Doomtown when it's released. If you stumble upon Star Wars, you owe it to yourself to try it.
[If It Fits Your Macros (IIFYM)]( is a good place to start.
When I was aiming to lose 1.5 lbs per week, I was allotted 1800-1900 calories per day (at the time). My goal weight was 165 lbs, so I aimed for 165 g of protein per day. It just happened to work out to 40% of my calories coming from protein. I didn't pay much attention to carbs and fats.
I perform HIIT workouts 4-5 times per week, and as my weight fell off, my calories reduced as well. I was out of energy when I was down to 1600 cal/day. I changed to losing 0.5 lbs per week, which boosted my calories back to around 2000/day, and the energy returned, and the remaining 10 lbs came off. I am in maintainence mode at around 2200 calories per day and taking in ~205-210 g of protein per day.
I want to get the carbs and fats in line too, and researching IIFYM tells me I will do well to cut back on protein and increase the carbs.
TL/DR: your PT is likely right. Goto [IIFYM]( Eat more to lose more, at this point.
I'm reading a biography on Landry called "The Last Cowboy" that's very interesting, and talks about the rivalry between the two men. Landry owned the Defense, and Lombardi was the offensive guru. The Giants' owner, Wellington Mara, informally promised both men that they would get the head coaching job when the then Giants coach, Jim Lee Howell, retired. Lombardi, tired of being put off for the HC job eventually left for Green Bay (though he later had secret talks about coming back as HC in NY down the line). Landry, seeing the writing on the wall when Allie Sherman was brought in to replace Lombardi as OC and was treated as the heir apparent, left for Dallas a year or two later, bolstered by a statement from Howell that Landry was the "best coach in the league."
Apparently Landry and Lombardi were cordial, but never close. They had very different lifestyles. Lombardi came from a Catholic immigrant family in New York, was loved by his players and had a certain propensity for alternating between bombast and being crestfallen that led Landry to refer to him as "Mr. High-low." Landry, on the other hand, was a staid,  man from a small Bible Belt Texas town who was respected, but rarely loved by the people he coached, who was seen as reserved, aloof, and understated, in victory and defeat. They had very different perspectives. According to the book (a good read, by the way), they had a healthy respect for each other, but didn't really understand each other, and certainly had a healthy, if not heated, rivalry as well.
 Landry and Lombardi were very different people who had mutual respect, but a certain lack of understanding as well.
Don't they believe that there is no such thing as a god? That's a belief too. Any statement that cannot be backed by evidence, is a belief.
You may not call it a religion, maybe a label then?
 semantics.  
Hi, glad to see more people joining the hobby.  So, everything said so far is true, deckbuilders toolkit good, fat packs good, prereleases good.  If you don't have a local game store yet then look [here]( The LGS is where you can go to buy mtg product, meet new players, play with others, and maybe, eventually, play in tournaments.  If you don't have an LGS close to you then send me a PM, I can give you some tips on buying Magic stuff without a game store nearby.
As soon as you can, start transitioning to [booster boxes]( for getting new packs.  This is the most cost effective way to open packs.  If you can't afford it right away try to find a friend to split a box with you, make sure you split the *packs* not the *cards*.
When you buy packs always buy from the newest block, which is to say the cards released this year.  These cards will spend the longest time in [Standard]( which is the format with the most players.  Right now the Newest Sets are Theros and Born of the Gods FYI.
Avoid buying individual cards if at all possible.  Instead trade the ones you have either to the store or better yet to other players.  This will keep your actual money free for more booster boxes.  Get a binder that can hold your valuable cards that are for trade, take it with you if you go to the game store so you can trade.  
When trading always remember to check whatever anyone says about card prices online, you can do that [here](  Only trade if you want to, and don't **ever** feel pressured to do a trade you don't like.  You are in control of your cards until you shake hands, no one else has a claim to them.
I would suggest learning to [draft]( because this is a way to both play the game and open more packs for value. If you want to learn to draft I would suggest using [Magic the Gathering Online]( for $10 you can do a bunch of really cheap drafts to get used to how drafting works.
As far as playing goes, I would suggest playing [Commander]( to start.  Commander is about big explosive multiplayer games and it is the *cheapest format for new players*.  All you need to play Commander is a deck designed built for the format, and Magic just happens to sell really good prebuilt [decks]( for around [$20]( ready to play.
This hobby can be overwhelming to take in at first, but the main reason I see people quit playing magic is that they get screwed out of all their cards in trades or they get convinced to spend way too much money before they even learn what everything is worth.  I started playing only about a year ago and today magic is my favorite hobby.  Have fun and end wisely.  Find videos and articles online that explain the different aspects of the hobby and find some friends who like to play.  Soon you will be established in Magic and you can help other new players get started in magic.
**Waaaaaaaay *:  Try not to buy anything without asking yourself, **"how is this going to help me have more fun?"**.
The U.S. is just acting like douchebags now. Trying to bring this regional politics debacle into everything. 
Last week the U.S. tried to woo China and India against Russia, China refused, and yesterday they went to Japan and Taiwan to back japanese militarization and Taiwan independence. 
 U.S. foreign policy today appears to be run by a bunch of highschool girls that lacks any of the intelligence and cunning of the Cold War era. 
I personally think that if you have the right mental approach to martial arts, you can learn something from anyone, even a beginner. People with disadvantageous physical attributes tend to learn creative ways to be dangerous. It helps to train with a diversity of people.
I trained once with this hippy-looking dude who was super skinny and didn't have an ounce of muscle on him. But he had a very dangerous guard and landed triangles pretty often. The only time I went unconscious fighting off a triangle in training was going against that skinny fucker who looked like a failed accountant.
I trained once (very briefly) with a brown belt woman. Her fucking guard was ridiculously flexible and agile. I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to pass her guard. Every time I got close, she found a way to get her legs back into position. Unfortunately, I was only able to roll with her a couple of times. She was a guest instructor. My loss.
Myself personally, I am not a tall dude and started out not weighing much, yet I trained with mostly wrestlers who were larger than me. I quickly learned to develop my own technique (mostly for defense) that frustrated people. From what I have heard of Eddie Bravo's past, this is exactly how he started developing his rubber guard 10th planet shit. As I watch some of his techniques, I remember doing things similar to that, though not nearly as intricate. I remember landing a gogoplata once on someone before I knew what a gogoplata was. I was doing weird flexible high guard shit with this larger wrestler who was applying pressure, and I saw that I could wrap my foot around his throat and...holy shit he fucking tapped. What the fuck was that? The point is that I may not have even tried something like that if I wasn't a smaller guy training with larger wrestlers.
**The cons of training with a woman**, for me, was having occasional awkward grappling situations. I remember the first time I trained with a girl once who had a very large chest. I had mount and was naturally going for an armbar and realized my habit of putting my hands on the chest area ... right on her gigantic boob. Fuck...sorry.. God damn it. So I immediately apologized and learned to adjust my technique pretty quickly. Luckily, it wasn't a big deal to her. Cool. 
Another girl (she was very new to grappling) started training with us and she was trying for a triangle choke but ended up with a leg scissors position around my head... and wasn't even close to getting it, but my fucking face was right in her crotch for like a full minute as I was trying to pry her legs off. The thing was, her husband was training with us too and he was watching, and he was a cool dude who was just there to support her because she wanted to get into grappling/jiu jitsu. She thought she had a choke, so she didn't want to let go of the position. She played soccer so her legs were pretty strong, and I was trying not to push off her ass. That was a little awkward.
Oh, one unfortunate thing that can happen at a gym when training with women, I saw guys act inappropriately toward a "new girl" on two occasions. One time in particular, this wrestler guy kept getting her into awkward positions and talking to her playfully and she was clearly not enjoying it. She was very enthusiastic and had a great attitude and his behavior could potentially fuck that up. I stopped them and said another guy wanted to show her a specific technique. The wrestler dude got upset about it. I switched with her (so I was grappling with him) and I immediately smelled a faint scent of alcohol on his breath. That pissed me off. He was bigger than me, but I pushed really hard and dominated position with him, held him in side control and got his back, went to mount, scrambled and threatened an arm triangle. He was not having a good day. He stopped from exhaustion and I imagine almost throwing up. Fuck that dude. I don't think he trained with us again after that day.
Anyway, just keep an open mind. Everyone has some potential to be a badass in some way. If you are their training partner, you should be trying to improve while helping them to become a badass, whether a man or a woman.
**TL:DR** GOD DAMN I TYPE A LOT!
It's easier to influence the game as a midlaner but a good Jungler will have much more impact on the game if he plays right. Mid lanes all abaut map awareness and jungle is all abaut objective control. as Jungler, you control which objectives your team is going after. If your seen Bot lane defending a split pusher the enemy team has a tower in bag. If your position is unseen the enemy team can't realy play agressive

Jungler can realy make or break a team and has the most impact on the game whether its positive or negative 
If you have dirty air from the filter it has to suck more of it to properly mix enough with gas. Those working harder. It can also be the reason for a car running rough. In some cases. 
Air filters are cheap change them. 
true not 100% is random but most are. very rarely do they really control them. Also im in the time zone where DE is based on as a main time and i still will see great stuff when i sleep. there's no pleasing everyone. And the ones they do control are potatoes, but occasionally they will take something into their hands. For example the last dev stream gave a glaive for Melee 2.0 but besides that there have been other cases where they have to do something but honestly i can only think of 1 other time. when vauban alerts where messed up and that was months ago. TLDR its random and everyone suffers 
Got my pcdl through Barclays. Never again. They screwed up my application and lost several forms I had sent them. I had to open an account with them and getting the woman to just open a normal account no extras no overdraft was a mission In itself. She even went as far as actually filling out the form for the account I didn't want even though I told her several times to just open a normal current account, if I hadn't of checked properly before signing then I would of been liable for the monthly fee for the extras I didn't bloody won't. 
 Barclays are wankers. 
No offense, but why do you think this?
It won't change anything... you will combine the hash rates and combine the payout. So the difficulty will go up, but so will the payout.
Further, Doge is not significantly more profitable than LTC mining, so any increase in difficulty will be commensurate with the payout. There will be almost no change, except that half of the Doge you are currently receiving will be paid in LTC instead - all we have to do is (automatically) trade it at an exchange or mine with an auto-exchanging pool.
 Merged mining will literally not change anything except making our coin more secure.
with this deal we would essentially be creating the biggest multipool ever. the LTC guys are 3x our current hashrate and will force out a large majority of our dedicated doge miners as they will see far fewer rewards than they already do (keep in mind multipools are already a large part of our hashrate). we would essentially drown our value, and people cant see the blatant contempt coblee has for our community, then I fear for our future.
tl:dr: coblee called us a scam coin not 30 minutes ago
except currently you can assume close to 60% (conservatively low) of mined doge from block rewards are being held and not introduced to the exchanges. if you scale that to what the addition of mining power is, that 60% now becomes about 13% (conservatively high) of all minors can be expected to hold their doge. this means that the amount of newly introduced doge will go from 40% to roughly 88%%. as the new miners are not primarily doge holders, you can expect them to act like a multipool, mining and dumping at below exchange rate. 
hopefully you can see why this is bad.. we are basically giving the thumbs up for multipools that are combined 3x the size of our hashrate to start mining (and remember we already have multipools mining us). 
seeing as how dogecoin holders already have less than a 15% chance to get a block (and then you need to be in 1 of the many many pools which split that 15%) the amount of generated LTC that can be expected to be traded to doge is ludicrously low compared to their already existing traffic.
 we might be able to convert LTC-&gt;doge but they will dump doge-&gt;LTC at a much faster rate and have a much steeper effect on our value than we will have on theirs. 
&gt;sometimes that means a different area / longer commute
This is why I really think commute costs should be part of the equation. Just using mortgage/rent is a bit misleading as it favors a lower mortgage vs a longer commute.
Commute costs add up a lot faster than people realize ... especially when you consider total wear-n-tear. Even just for gas for a 10 mile commute ...
30 miles/gal * total round trip (20) = .66 gallons per day.
.66 gallons * 3.75 = $2.47 per workday
260 workdays * $2.47 = $642/year
642 / 12 = $53.50 / mo
Remember ... that $53.50 per month is pure gas costs and assume 30 miles to the gallon. Total wear-n-tear on the car is significantly more ... but trickier to calculate assuming you'll own a car whether your commute is 2 miles vs 15.
 Ignoring commute costs when considering the 30% rule is not advised.
Easy, give them loans for credit they cant afford. Slowly just make everyone homeless, create a welfare system, demonize those in the welfare system, give them as little needed so they don't revolt, have them work "jobs" for their welfare, automate everything but keep the most valuable stuff for yourself, give the welfare state just enough to keep them from killing everyone. 
 Basically the plot of Elysium.
Apple is heavily subsidized in the US by the phone carriers, and yes, most people do regard a cell phone as necessary.
Google makes their money from advertising. You the individual are a product to them, the corporations that pay them money to put specific information in front of you are the actual customers.
And yes, advertising is a required service for most companies, and many companies that have required goods and services do advertise.
For example, in my state you're legally required to buy car insurance in order to drive. Car insurers advertise on google in order to get business.
 Just because a good or service isn't required for you, doesn't mean it isn't required for someone.
Yeah, 45 minutes is nothing. Most people in my area work in or around NYC. That's more than a 90 minute drive during rush hour or about a 60 minute train ride.
NYC is the busiest place in the USA. The majority of people that work in NYC commute over 45 minutes each way.
You're more right than you know.
Republicans' current game-plan is, in the grand scheme of things, short-term and ultimately suicidal. Granted, their actions probably won't truly affect them for a few decades at least, but when it does it'll be hard and unforgiving.
Right now, they are appealing to the sensibilities of the Baby Boomers that are their biggest voting bloc, and in the face of the progression of time are fighting harder and shouting louder to do so. But the Baby Boomers won't live forever, and when they start leaving the voting pool due to mortality, the political landscape will be left with those who grew up during the generally good Clinton years, with the first major political memory being the Clinton affair witch-hunt. This followed by the jaw-droppingly bad Bush years, and now the further insanity during Obama's term.
I'm not just speculating this either - polls show that young people of the last few generations have been increasingly more liberal, and while short-term demographics show a trend in increasing minority polulation that's becoming a huge worry to Republicans (Texas will likely be a purple state in the next decade or so due to this), in the long-term the way they've alienated the youth will bite them even harder than how they've alienated minorities.
*** - the harder Republicans push to the right now, the harder it'll hit them once the baby boomer start dying off.
Like everything, employment goes in waves. It is a 'natural' cycle of supply and demand. If there is a lot of supply and little demand for a job, the employer can pick the candidate they want and pay them less. Back in the 1990's it was the opposite. People would graduate from college and have their pick of businesses to make $50k from, even with a shit Poly Sci degree like mine. 
You better believe that in ten years a college degree will be more valuable than it is today. The economy is forcing people away from the humanities and towards trades. Less people going to school, which is happening, = more opportunity for current degree holders. I'd bet money on this happening, if I had any.
I have worked the corporate world since I graduated. Was fortunate and found a decent $30k a year job right after work. Now stuck in Customer Service, making about a dollar more an hour after many years. "He can type well, and write a well though out thesis, let's make him do e-mails." 
It sucks. I hate it. But what can you do but wait? I will be going back to school in the fall to get a Masters in Instruction so I can be a teacher. We will always need teachers. Plus, many of them get further education paid for. A big benefit. 
TLDR Things will get better. 
As a 34 year old, when I was in my teens this type of advice still worked, but I was too young for it to start applying.  Between the age of 14-28 I could basically walk in to any place and have a job before I walked back out.  As my experience grew, so did my starting pay.  The last "secure" job I had was in 2009, with only a handful of college credits and based primarily on my experience only, I got a job as a NOC tech in a data center starting out @ $14 an hour not counting quarterly bonuses that ranged from $500-$2000 depending on how we did in that quarter and my performance, I was a top performer.  After my 2nd year including bonuses and holiday pay I was clearing $55k a year, full benefits, and only working 4 days a week (I worked night shifts 4-8pm, midnight-8am) doing something I thoroughly enjoyed.
Once the economy and the bailouts started to move in, the company I worked for made cutbacks, being the newest and lowest on the totem pole I was one of many who were let go.  Since then it's been a circus act of side jobs, contract jobs, working with friends who run their own businesses etc. etc.  I've applied from everything from sys admin jobs which I'm qualified for, to working in fast food and I get told the same things -
"You have too much experience"
or
"You don't have enough experience"
Right now I'm a commercial fisherman.  A friend of mine has been doing it since he was 9, it's a family thing.  Season is closed 2 months out of the year, luckily he found us a landscaping job for this month and next month, and because his uncle and dad are disabled he needs to start finding people he can rely on to run one of the multiple boats they own.  So if I stick around, I might have that... which would be nice, running my own boat, being my own boss, and relying on my work ethic.
But it's still not what I originally planned on.  I wanted to be a marine biologist, until I found out I could never afford the college tuition that was needed to actually make it anywhere.  Then I set my sights on IT, since it was the hot new job market in the 90's and early 00's and because my mom had been and still is in a successful position within her company I figured it would be a "steady" and "reliable" job with plenty of room for advancement.  Not now, it's all contract and temporary employment placement.  At least at my skill level.  I've steadily watched over the past 8 years, the pay continuously drop.  It's gone from 13-18 an hour starting out, to 10-12 an hour starting out at a new place of employment in the same field, and they want more out of you than they did before.
The worst part for those like myself who have to keep busy and keep their mind running and constantly thinking or with ego problems, to go from having a steady job, and the ability to just go somewhere else without batting an eye... it destroys you from the inside out.  I've pretty much battled with depression due to this since 2009 when I lost my "secure" career path.  Any and all motivation to "succeed" is "blah".
But, bills have to be paid, food has to be purchased, etc. etc. etc. so I like many others do "what I can".  It is what it is.  It's an epidemic that a lot of people aren't really grasping in its entirety and how it's going to affect us socially and economically in the next 20 years or so.  Especially considering the uprising of people under 25 who were raised during the economic boom with a sense of entitlement.  Who continue to perform poorly at their job because they "expect" a certain amount of respect or pay just for showing up on time.
Sorry for the rant.  Just random shit I had dancing around in my head after reading that article, your comment, and a few other comments.
- 34, I understand the article as it applies to me, just dealing with it like everything else, because life in a capitalist world.
Well, keep this in mind among the doom and gloom about tech recruitment. Almost all recruited jobs are through these companies, for a couple of reasons:
1. Hiring programmers and other tech staff is very risky.
2. Filtering people for skill is hard, and the recruiters, while bad at it, do usually filter out the crazies. Usually.
3. Coming on as a contractor, *and doing a good job*, is how you develop a network that will eventually get you hired full-time or help you move to another company when you need to do so.
Point three is crucial today. Nobody stays at a single job for more than a few years, so any company where you know someone can potentially become a resource that you can use in the future. Thus, try your damnedest to be good at your job and pleasant to your colleagues&amp;mdash;because while doing so has great benefits in itself, one of the indirect effects is that you avoid the consequences you'd suffer if people don't like you, or think you're incompetent.
**** Go into the job with a good attitude. Try hard. Do well. Make friends. Those friends will help you get more jobs when you need them.
Here's the thing about people who passionately work hard and try their best every single day that can't seem to get a good job/catch a break. Yes, a good % of them are unlucky. However, not being educated with how the systems work will cause good people/workers to be stuck in their crappy low paying jobs.
The hardest workers who don't understand these concepts WILL get buried in their job/department for these reasons. Knowing how to get out is harder than how to get in.
1. Their are very few people in upper positions/management who will reach out to a hard working employee no matter what the circumstance is. If you want more money/better job and you don't want to leave your company you have to reach out yourself, it's nobody's job but your own to network and make connections and build bridges (and not burn them). If you want a senior/executive mentor, YOU ASK AND YOU MAKE TIME FOR THEM. They are more than willing, but you have to make the effort.
2. The world is bigger than a shop/department. It's a basic principle that for every mechanic turning a wrench in a corporation there are 5-8 employees supporting that employee. WHO ALL MAKE MORE MONEY THAN THE MECHANIC. Find a way to delve into this world, even if off hours.
3. Degrees are a hall pass in major corporations, if you don't have one you are only able to get into unique jobs if you know somebody or get lucky. If you have one it is completely up to you to knock on every door at the company incessantly to try to get in.
4. Accept it now that if you want to get paid better younger do not expect to work in a field/type of work you enjoy. Put your time in, pay your dues, and get into what you want to do when you are older.
5. Always keep in mind that to a corp, you are just a number. This is not democracy these days, it's the United States of Corporate America, they have the money and power to hire people for cheaper who will work harder than you will. Having a good reputation inside of the company raises your personal "stock value" to your employer. If they think they can make more money off of you in a better higher paying position, they will put you there.
6. Never stop applying to jobs you want. I'll give the example at my company. Unless people have ABET certified engineering degrees or MIT/Harvard type schools on your record, most people need to apply to 30+ jobs of any type before getting an interview, people without degrees is normally 60+ depending on the needs of the company at the time. This is big business in a saturated market at it's best. Even the best resumes get overlooked when there 1000 people applying for a $50,000 office administrator job. It's the facts of life.
I can probably make about a 100 point bullet list on the facts of working life outside of  small mom and pops companies but these are true for the most part (I always accept that there are exceptions to these rules at all times.)

if you want to get paid you have to work hard not only at your job, but at your network yourself. No one else will do it for you.
I see what you're saying and it bothered me a lot the first time I saw it. But the second time I changed my mind. To me that scene as the last time he did things his dad's way -- not using his powers and risking discovery. Despite him being super, his Dad is still his dad, and when he looks at him and essentially says, "No, let me die," Clark hates it but obeys. But in losing him makes him realize that he doesn't want to live that way and he can't do it anymore. It takes him paying such a deep price to finally realize that no, he can't stay on the sidelines.
From that point on, he chooses to help. At first he still tries to be anonymous, going from place to place and doing what he can only to disappear once he's revealed his power. But when push comes to shove and his choice is do nothing or fully reveal himself, he does it. I have to think that watching Pa die when he had the power to stop it was the defining moment in his life, the one that made him give himself up without hesitation.
- I think the fact that he could have saved Pa Kent actually makes it a more defining moment in Clark's life.
From a  BC perspective we cannot afford this in a globalized Near-ZIRP economy. Period.
It **DOES NOT** "just cost $7 per day". Quebec receives $8bn/yr (EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR) in federal transfer payments, yet they are still crippled with high taxes and runaway debt loads.

The major players pushing this in the media every 8 months in BC are these people:
**Coalition of Child Care Advocates of BC**

**Early Childhood Educators of British Columbia**

Here is a list of other interested ~~shills~~ parties:

The CCCA/ECE claims it would cost BC alone 1.5-2 billion PER YEAR, but they neglect to tell you this estimate is with NON-UNION WORKERS (among other deceptive things).
But wait! **The CCCA has a stated goal to unionize the labor in this program**. This will just be another group of thugs holding kids hostage with an egregious list of demands every other year. 
From their own webpage:
*We support unionization as an important strategy for advancing the sector. Currently a number of different unions represent some BC early childhood educators, and all teachers and classroom-based school staff are represented by one of two unions. We also support the democratic right of workers to unionize and choose which union can best represent them.*
Go read their economic citations and "estimates" (aka toilet paper) for a laugh, it's full of Newspeak bullshit pulled out of their collective asses.

tl;dr
It's not going to happen. Go turn another country into an indebted shithole, if you CHOOSE to have kids then YOU pay for them. 

 

I keep re-reading this post and I can't decide how I feel about it.
On one hand, I completely agree that being upset and angry all the time isn't conducive to a happy or productive lifestyle (Though nothing from the other guys post suggest that's the way he lives).
For that matter, I agree that kindness to all - including our fellow humans of course - is our best weapon in the fight for equality and compassion.
That being said, I feel like you're being too aggressive yourself. He didn't say anything that was unkind or cruel.
Expressing ones distaste and anger for the dark things in the world is healthy, it relieves stress, it's a form of self-epxression. I don't know about the other guy, but personally it makes me very angry to know what all is going on around the world that causes both animal and humans alike to suffer.
Make no mistake, this is not so much anger with people, as anger with the cultural conditioning that keeps things this way. As you said, most people are not evil. Rather, they are often ignorant of the situation or brainwashed to ignore it and their own hypocritical thinking (Harming dogs=Bad, Harming pigs=Okay).
Obviously, none of this should make me unhappy with myself or my life, nor should I become inconsiderate or aggressive toward others. But I feel like telling someone to relax, or more importantly to become complacent by accepting things as they are may be equally dangerous.
Discomfort with a situation is what inspires positive activism - a product we dearly need if we are to spread positive change.
I'm also not sure what point is supposed to be made by saying "you're no more guilty than they are". We may all share the capacity for selfishness, but not all selfishness carries with it dire consequences for others.
Further, as a vegan you've taken steps to seek out what of your habits does harm, and attempt to remove those things. To belittle that effort is no way to encourage someone.
I'm not sure if that was your intention. And really, I agree that being vegan does not make one a saint by any means. That being said, in this one thing (the treatment if animals), are we not examples for others?
The concept of all "sin" being equal is an ancient and resilient barrier to progress in humanitarian movements (Because the philosophy behind it requires altruism to be considered pointless). Though admittedly, being as self-righteousness is trumped by humbleness in terms of social acceptance and spreading a message, how altruistic you are about a thing isn't something to lean on.
But it's not something to insult or diminish either. If I see someone doing social work, giving to a noble cause, or vocally fighting for change, I cheer them on to encourage them and encourage others to join them. Even in situations where I myself am not giving the time or resources to help out (Out of laziness or selfishness).
I might - as I often do - have read way too deeply into this. But I've written it up now, might as well post it and hope it contains something that resonates with some folk.
 Be nice to everyone, using only example is sometimes too slow at inspiring change, we shouldn't bash altruism, and try not to snuff out activistic passion.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think people focus too much on this as a whole. I know this is slightly off topic, but I'm going to post it anyway.
Who cares who takes whose name? Does it really matter? I mean, sure it's a little different for a male to take a female's name, but in the end, will it change anything?
You'll still love each other, and want to be unified with one another, and that's what marriage is really all about. Being with the person you love, and showing your commitment to them, regardless of what may happen. The name has nothing to do with it.
 Don't worry so much about who takes whose name, as long as you love each other and are ready for marriage. Focus more on that than on the finer details like this, in my opinion, and do whatever makes you both comfortable.
Thanks! It's really hard when you feel people are against you, we had just come home and he still had high jaundice, they had strong armed me in the hospital to add formula after nursing because my milk hadn't come in yet. I refused to give him more than 10-15ml of formula because I knew it would compromise my breastfeeding. He spit most of the formula up anyway so I don't even think he got much of it at all. My milk came in on day 3 so I promptly hid the formula and refused to use it. Bought a nipple shield to dull the pain because he was lip tied(didn't know it yet, but he tore me up). I'll never forget those words that made me shut everyone out that day "you should give him formula, he's not being satisfied by you". From my own mother. She was here to support me, even was able to make it to the birth because her plan landed the day I was induced. I just felt so betrayed. (Dramatic I know, but after the nurse in the hospital not being sympathetic about taking my son to the UV box I was on edge already). She just kept talking about how he shouldn't be wanting to nurse so much and he's not satisfied and eventually convinced my husband of it. She had no idea how breastfeeding really is because she was from the formula era, and the hospital told her I was "allergic to breastmilk" as a baby. It's not the worst thing that could happen to a mom that wants to Ebf but it was pretty disheartening to me at the time.
Lol sorry, it's still something that gets under my skin because now she asks if "you *still* breastfeeding that baby?" Yes. Yes I am. 
Bahaha sorry, it always makes me rant when I go back and think about it. I'm done I swear!
mother was uneducated with breastfeeding and said hurtful things(albeit, well intended I'm sure) after a stressful hospital stay and nearly convinced husband breast was not best.
I run a small woman owned small business that I started myself. I detest taxes because the government tax collectors are only there on good days. If I lose money, the government isn't there saying, "here, have some money". They are a fair weather friend. I am sick of all the "oh, I can't get a job" whining from all the liberals. Make a frikkin job. I have a Brazilian woman clean my house. Hardly speaks English, but makes a decent living. There are lots of ways to make a living, but you have to get out of bed and get creative. Small business is the answer to much of the minwage/corporatism/jobless problems. Go out and steal customers from some big dumb company. They won't even notice. 
STFU and go out and try something. Shut off the XBox and fire up your website that sells whatever you are good at.
Edit: TIL don't talk about personal experience in self-sufficiency on /politics because  /politics is not real, it is liberal fantasies of the utopian world unaffected by anyone's real world experiences.
gen x reporting in. 4 roommates, beater car, under qualified for my job instead of one that I'm qualified for and makes me miserable. 

 do what makes you happy.
&gt;  I write off literally every purchase I make since I'm almost always technically "working".
 life goes better with tax evasion
I kinda feel bad for a lot of college goers :( I dropped out of high school and started working right away. I worked a lot shitty jobs sometimes two at once (roofer bouncer pizza delivery construction) pretty much bottom of the barrel stuff but i saved my money.
By the time I was 28 I bought my own house outright no payments. I own a new car. At the same time all my friends are graduating college moving back in with their parents with a degree thats going to do fuck all for them. Im 30 now semi retired 14 years of hard work taking a few years off.. Owning everything makes it very easy to live. Without the monkey on your back of a house payment or a car payment.
Tl DR college is great and all but no substitute for hard work you can be as successfull if not more then most college educated people with just a good head on your shoulders. If a idiot goes to college hes still an idiot
I'm starting my masters degree in June and I'm so fucked in life it's not even funny. After my graduate degree I'm going to owe about $85k in loans. A large part of that is my fault because I went to culinary school right out of high school and wasted money on a baking degree that I'm not using. I'm working on my masters in library science (focusing on information technology). Right now I work full time and make $9.46/hr 40 hours a week. I live with 2 other roommates and I'm always poor as fuck. I don't qualify for SNAP benefits because my roommates make more money than me so because of that "I" make enough to eat. I have to do my masters degree or else my bachelors is going to be pretty worthless. I look for new jobs constantly and apply almost daily, no luck yet since I don't have a masters I hardly qualify for any of the good jobs. I just want enough money to have a family and be comfortable and eat. Apparently that's too much to ask for and I'll be paying off my debt until I die. I kind of wish I never went to college if my loan payments are going to be so much after I graduate it'll be like paying rent probably $400 a month+ I can barely afford my rent now let alone a second "rent" payment on top of that. 
High school was so misleading. "You must pick a career now, you must go to college or you're a loser who faps all night in your parents basement."
 I owe a fuck ton of money and I'm probably screwed forever.
One thing I'm sure of is that spotH3D is right. Having a child will not fix your relationship and will definitely not improve your sex life. If I had to guess, it would probably be more detrimental at this point. You sound like an awesome person, and would probably be a great parent, so I am sure you don't want to subject a child to a strained home situation. Maybe having a child would make sex afterward seem naughtier and more exciting for him, but I'd err on the side of caution and not take the chance.
That said, I have a theory. Consider spicing up your [protected] sex so that it mimics a drug; use his biological wiring to your advantage. Drugs are novelty-reward based and context-dependent. Have you tried sex in thrilling/novel places? Novel/naughty positions? The more exciting the sex, the more he might associate sex with that physiological reward he used to have with drugs and he might subsequently crave it. This is purely hypothetical, but it has some scientific merit.
A waning sex life can be incredibly painful when both SOs aren't waning together. It's important to know that it is a *natural* event in every relationship, though. Don't get down on yourself! Could be a side effect from drug treatments. Could just be the natural course of your relationship. Once you figure out what's happening, then maybe consider having kids. 
**** Wait to have kids until you are at peace and in sync with each other about the state of your sex life.
Yeah... By trying to distinguish yourself from your nation you are being condescending - it implies that you think you are better than your nation (read:being a prick) which just makes it even more annoying. I honestly prefer the "wtf n00b feed" to "Lol, Shen. You're the only asshole here." I mean come on, look at all that redundant pronounciation! "LOL shen, you're the only asshole here" is more "normal", and even then you're still kinda flaming..
Remember that the people who "hate" russian gamers usually do so because they have bad attitudes - For example, i know that a lot of people dislike polish players (on EUNE) because in lower levels of play, there are a lot of polish players who tend to not take blame for their mistakes, which infuriates players (nevermind that there are a lot of other nationalities that do it)... When i was lower level i used to very much dislike Polish players (and still do take the occasional jab at the nationality when with friends) and would immediately regret queuing up as soon as i saw a name ending with "PL", but now I don't mind them as the majority of them don't flame abhorrently and DO acknowledge their mistakes (read: they aren't honoring their stereotypes)
don't try to be better than your nation cause it makes you a prick, don't confirm stereotypes
Also, "Jesus christ buddy, whats gotten into you?" is actually kinda funny
After I got sober I **got** grown up relationships with the people in my life as a result I was blessed with family and two children, and now a 3 1/2 grandson who is the light of my life.  Sobriety, and the foundation that I laid through recovery early on, helped me through the darkest days and back.  
I lost my mind, and very nearly my life.  I was restored to sanity; and I am happier and freer now than ever before.
I think the thing that everyone's overlooking is this: Does anyone realize what a teaspoon-full of this shit actually TASTES like? It tastes like pepper and burning, and not in a good way. It does not incentivize one to swallow it. 
I realize that nicotine is readily absorbed through mucosal membranes such that you would find in one's mouth. But if I am squirting this into my mouth with a dripper bottle, I'm probably not gonna get past a couple drops before I spit it back out.
I think we need a simple phrase with which to fire back at all the "OMG think of the toddlers!" stories. Like maybe:
*** yeah it SMELLS delicious, but it tastes like peppery shit in liquid form. and yeah, everybody is in favor of childproof caps.
I was fine with him last year: since pretty much all our centerbacks were hurt, his recklessness was a necessary evil.  I assumed we'd thank him for his service and let him go over the offseason.  That didn't happen. Then the club put out some cool videos showcasing how funny he is and I sort of forgot how erratic he was on the field.  I assumed that maybe Caleb or Gavin pulled him aside and explained how important it was to keep out of trouble, that refs would be watching him closer this year...From what I've seen so far, they didn't talk to him or he didn't listen. 
 
 Yes I'm fucking uneasy about him.
I had a similar problem with no skates being wide enough for flat feet. I found the cowling on the bauer supreme ones to have enough room between the outside edge and the plastic mold to have a shop punch out the sides. The skates are very hard, and my feet usually hurt after warmups, but by comparison, I couldn't fit into a pair of grafs.

try bauers, punch out if close
I am glad no one died in that mass attack. However given how politicized everything has become I fear that reasonable attempts at getting people mental health help probably will have to be avoided. 
Also let me note that handguns aren't massively more dangerous than knives .
In the recent Fort Hood incident, a surprisingly simkl;ar incident (institutional space and almost the same time frame)  the  shooter who was a trained soldier equipped with .45 caliber handgun a caliber considered to be highly effective killed 3 and wounded 16 in his rampage 
While no one was killed at the school  thank goodness and the wounds were less serious , the kid than ran amok was a small shy teen armed only with a knife. he certainly could have brought molotov cocktails or other non firearm weapons and had he been stronger the death toll would have been higher. 
The difference wasn't as great as some imagine. 
Note too that its a social issue, in the past   it  was common in  some areas for guns ow other weapons for  hunting or sport (schools used to have gun clubs to be owned by young people and even to bring them into a classroom with permission, 
Note [here](
Note this 
I grew up at a time when people were not afraid of people with firearms,’ said (Supreme Court Justice Antonin) Scalia, noting that as a youth in New York City he was part of a rifle team at the military school he attended. ‘I used to travel on the subway from Queens to Manhattan with a rifle,’ he said. ‘Could you imagine doing that today in New York City?’” I have heard other reports of people carrying long guns openly in New York City in the 1950s, with no police being called, no schools locked down, no panic, no problems. Why was this so back then, but not now
Our society has decayed measurably from that point and there is no way to return to that healthy a society. Blame in on whatever you like, divorce and social change are my choices. There are others of course.
In truth we've become a society that suspends  kids for eating a pastry  and having it look like a gun. [Source]( 
The social comity and healthy families  that would allow for a better society  is gone .Beyond that even helping people is a challenge as society has become political and vindictive  people rightly or wrongly peoples especially on the Right  think psychology will be used to destroy political enemies not treat legitimate illnesses.

Glad no one was killed, good medicine and luck helped more  than gun laws, We need a healthier society and I have no idea how to get it. 
This will not likely be seen by many, but this happened to me when I was 5, and it was quick, and violent.  I was outside playing by myself.  My older sister was supposed to be watching me (spoiler alert: she wasn't).  I bent down to pet said feral cat, and before I knew it I was mauled.  I remember banging on the screen door yelling for my mom while feeling something dripping from my head.  It was warm and was flowing.  I then remember bright lights, doctors, and pain.  They didn't want to suture the lacerations because of opportunity for infection.  Instead, I had to wear this very tight, thin, gauze type cap for weeks to keep my scalp together.  Scars are still visible on my shoulder and head to this day.
 Feral cats are no joke.  I got mauled to shit.
Regardless of the strangeness of how the photos were taken as a side note it's pretty likely the perfume she's wearing has a [Civet]( base known for attracting cats.

They seem to have maximized the combination of most airplay with the least amount of popularity. Whenever someone is faced with a choice of which music to play to a broad audience--be it radio or TV or sports arena or whatever--Nickelback seems like a good choice because they have the right mix of elements. They're rock but not so heavy as to disturb people, but still edgy enough not to seem like a corporate contrivance. They're modern enough not to seem like a nostalgia thing while being old enough not to seem like the latest teenybopper group.
The result is that people tend to hear a lot of Nickelback despite very few people being really passionate about them. So, we think, "why the fuck do I keep hearing this stuff? These guys suck."
I may actually dislike certain modern country or southern rap or death metal much more than I dislike Nickelback, but it's easy to see that those other genres have dedicated fans and a real culture behind it. Nickelback is easy to hate because I don't associate them with real people.
EDIT: A lot of people object on the basis that Nickelback sells a lot of albums and fills up live venues. It tried to address that here.  a lot of people buy Nickelback stuff, but those people don't tend to have much influence on people who talk a lot about music (critics, hipsters, genre-specific fans, etc).

Guys, it's just a part of the game. We've been spoilt with the winning we over react to a tough game. Seriously speaking it is just one of those games where our tactics and our plays are completely closed off. Massive props to Atletico Madrid, to kick out a club like Barca is not an easy task.  Good job Atletico, bad day at the office for Barca. 
No problem guys, trust in Barca.. They always make us proud. Always...
I felt Murder House was the best. It had so much lore and all the different people made the house feel like it was never quiet. Something was always going on. The scene I recall in particular is when Nora Montgomery is in Vivians room and she movs towards her stomach, longing for the child. 
That just showed that even when the inhabitants of the house weren't there, they were still there. It added an atmosphere of being watched at every turn, like if you were looking into an empty room, that room was never really empty. 
Asylum just didn't do it for me. It was all over the place, the plot had no pacing, and all of the most interesting characters died too early and their plots closed too soon. The ending of Asylum pissed me off. You brought back Grace so she could die at the hands of Alma in easily the most ridiculously unbelievable twists of all time. Even M. Night Shyamalan would have said "What the fuck are you doing?"
Aliens are so overused that I felt AHS wasn't ready for an alien plotline, as a result I found myself hoping the Aliens were really part of Kits psychosis. I wanted him to be innocent, but still crazy, unfortunately that didn't happen. Instead they copped out of killing Grace by bringing her back, and then killed in her again. Sloppy writing for the sake of Shock Value. 
- Asylum was Trash. 
Instant messaging is about being instantly able to message. Not about being able to see when someone else is available, or their location, or...
SMS/texting is a form of instant messaging too, you know. 
Edit:
&gt;as for being available I'd say that's a good feature with instant messaging because you can determine how instant your message is.
Yeah no. See what I said up there, before you replied with the same you said before which I discredited with what I said up here.  no.
For those like myself who don't want yet another messaging app on my device, I find it odd that they're removing it from one app, making me download another app, which requires me to give it access to read my SMS and other things.

This depends - are you making the kebab yourself, or just buying it in a store? If making it yourself, it can be really healthy! 
Store bought can be trickier, but not impossible. Try asking them to shave some fresh meat off the top (as most of the fat and grease will run down as it heats/melts), and be careful which sauce you choose. The trick then is to only eat half the wrap, open it up and eat the remaining insides with a fork (to keep carbs to within healthy limits).
Most of this advice was on an episode of Biggest Loser Australia a couple of years back. Hope this helps!
TL; DR: it can be healthy. 
People like this give gun owners a bad name. Next time point it at ur head, that will show u trigger discipline.  Also pointed a loaded gun at ur friend (Camera man) is even worse than firing a gun threw ur dad's wall.

No human has the right to use a part of another human's body without permission: not fetus, not baby, not child, not teenager, not adult, and not senior. Even the deceased cannot be harvested for life-saving organs without consent. By outlawing abortion you're giving more rights to a fetus than any born person.
- It doesn't matter if a fetus considered a human or not as far as abortion is concerned.
&gt; No human has the right to use a part of another human's body without permission [...]
That isn't true by any litteral definition of right or law. If you live in America Roe Vs Wade says otherwise. The same is true for most other countries as well. 
- There are legal limitations on bodily autonomy. 
I have yet to try Nether Battlebow, Arko Tri (Y) has given me some good results with Savage Jho, although I never tried against normal Jho. 
If your armor allows, gem in Power Coating Add and another skill, but that's only for Nether Battlebow, Arko Tri has really low raw, so if you're going to use Arko Tri, get Element Attack Up, or even better, get Gigginox Z armor which has Stamina Thief (Great for Jho, the more he gets exhausted, the more meats he eats, which means more status), Thunder Attack +2 and Focus. 
My guess would be to use Nether Battlebow against normal Jho and Arko Tri for Savage, since Savage suffers much more elemental damage than the normal one.
 Arko Tri for Savage, Nether Battlebow (Later on, Nether Emprestador) for Normal.
And the dirty little secret of law enforcement is that their firearms training is pretty mediocre. Most officers, unless they are on a specialized SWAT outfit or other paramilitary unit, only have a requirement of a few dozen hours of range time a year, amounting to less than an hour a week. Any soldier or professional marksman will tell you that pistol shooting is fucking hard and it takes a whole heck of a lot of time on the range to be proficient ON THE RANGE, let alone in a tense hostage situation. With the level of training these cops get anything beyond 7 yards is probably just going to be a crap shoot on what they hit with their service weapons. And all the while the civilian population thinks that you have to be an ace shot to be a cop because the police actively encourage this image. The same goes for their situational and tactical training, it is minimal and ridiculous. This case is a perfect example, the cops have shit training to handle a hostage situation and end up intentionally shooting a hostage, but since they also have shit firearms training they accidentally shoot another hostage in the process. 
Cops have terrible firearms and tactical training, which is why this  shooting happened. 
Pulled out an old trick and fixed the resistance issue.  The fixed resistor I grabbed was actually a 200ohm resistor (face palm) so instead of waiting on a new one or scrounging one, I filed the resistor til it was at 218.5 ohms as per spec for the OKR.  Pretty simple to do with a needle file.  Just hook up your meter set to proper resistance range and file through the outer coating til you hit the resistance material (carbon film resistors only) and remove material til you hit your desired resistance.  With this method you can only increase resistance so you have to start with lower value than your target.
**TL, DR File a carbon film resister to raise the value**

I feel like a quick clarification is in order: You may "love" the premium Mustang, but it's EXACTLY the same as the non-premium P-51D-5 and -30 in terms of armament and flight model. The only difference in War Thunder is the increased research points (and silver lions output?).
I am currently getting to grips with the P-51's strengths in RB. Its advantages are its speed in level flight (faster than most planes on or below its tier) and its diving speed (will in my experience at least slightly outrun anything other than a jet). 
Its armament is still pretty weak. It takes a couple of attacks to get a fighter down, unless you manage to set them on fire or kill their pilot. 1.39 promises increased firing rate, which should improve its attack performance significantly. I wonder why it took THIS long to adjust its firing rate, since it would seem to be such a trivially simple amendment in terms of coding. An increase in firing rate diminishes the value of its high ammunition load, of course, but being able to put more ammunition into your enemy in the same (short) amount of time you have available for actually shooting at your opponent should more than make up for this; if you can aim, that is. I expect this change to increase the need for BnZ-type attacks in RB. In AB, it should make the Mustang a more viable aircraft, though it loses its most important advantages of energy retention and high-speed turn capability in that game mode.
I really hope that 1.39 will make the P-51 more durable, but I doubt this will happen, since it apparently wasn't a particularly sturdy plane in real life. But it is POSSIBLE, though unlikely, that Gaijin will finally admit that historical accuracy doesn't carry a lot of weight when it comes to gameplay balancing. I would prefer if they treated historical data as guidelines for making planes occupy the same roles they occupied in history, without the (stated) need to stick to the actual historical performance of the planes. What I mean by this, in plain English is this: I don't give a fuck what the plane did in real life, if historical accuracy gets in the way of enjoyable GAMEplay, then scratch accuracy and instead focus on maintaining the planes' historical role WITHIN the rules of this video game.
Enough rant for today. I think I'll post this as a standalone thread on r/WarThunder.
Thanks for your attention.
 SCREW history, but LOVE the game. *wink*
My maternal grandfather passed away in February. I grew up in NC while my mom, sisters, oldest brother, and my mom's side of the family live in Florida. My dad is a terrible person and when he went to jail me and my younger brother were placed with our paternal grandparents. That's why we live in NC instead of Florida. One of the bad things about having a father like mine is that people judge you because of it, even family. My father was extremely abusive to my mom and older siblings. When I finally got to see my family in Florida, for the first time since I was 6, I expected my grandpa to judge us. People here in NC look as us and only see our dad. My dad had tormented his youngest daughter and his her oldest children. Why wouldn't he judge us like everyone else? I was so wrong. My grandpa didn't care who our dad was. He never looked at us and saw our dad. We were his grandkids and that's all that mattered. Nothing was more important to him than his family and that included us. I will never forget the love and acceptance he showed. I hope to honor his memory by loving my family the way he loved them. The way he loved me. 
A grandparents love is a gift that can touch and change a heart forever. 
I was part of a two person team that, using precision tools, based upon our hypothesis, created a new and complex formation of filamentous biomaterials. We've been perfecting this experiment of many years now and recent results were satisfying. 
 got a hair cut. 
I created a pressure change in the air around me by striking a large cylindrical device with an organic polymer attached in both ends. These pressure changes formed longitudinal waves and approached my pinna, and then proceeded further down my ear canal. There it struck the ear drum, which sent forward the impulse through a series of bones and the cochlea, amplifying the impulse and sending it through the nervous system toward the brain. 
 Played the drum.
I don't even remember it but I'm sure it was terrible. Being the respectable ladylike 16 year old that I was, I went to a haunted house and got completely blackout drunk waiting in the line and ditched the rest of my friends with this guy that I didn't really know very well. He took me to this shopping center that had a little hill behind it and we sat there and was talking. That's when I actually blacked out and don't remember anything until maybe 1 am but that's a completely different story... I woke up the next day with this very passionate feeling in my chest, basically the feeling you get when you're drunk and fall in love I guess. So do I regret it?... I regret the whole night. The kiss didn't really effect my life much and I don't even remember it so I couldn't really care less whether it happened or not.
 Too drunk to remember first kiss. 
It takes years of study and complete submersion into a woman's world to even begin to remotely understand their subtle sexual gestures, so to say the words "men don't pick up on women's subtle hints" is an unterstatement. Men don't like subtle hints, men don't pick up subtle hints, and men are annoyed by women who never give more than just subtle hints. He may want you more than drug addict wants his next fix, but too nervous to do anything or say anything. Or he just doesn't know that he's attracted to you yet. Although your hint really wasnt that subtle, he apparently did't pick it up or is too shy to make the move.
I'm not going to tell you whether or not it's a good idea to try to bone your friend but I will tell you how to get him to agree to it if you so choose: If you want to do sex with him and he's not making a move, tell him in explicit detail what you want (try not to sound like a dominatrix though), or perform the fail-safe action (my personal favorite): 
**Grab his dick.** 
 Tell him that you want to do it, or grab his dick. 
I've been playing agro arena for months now. I draft one or two big creatures for top-decking scenarios then just anything I can throw down. The gamemode suits it too well. If you don't have an answer then who cares how much board value I gain out of my creatures. Hearthstone itself welcomes faceroll, hand-vomit strategies. Even in constructed a large majority of players are running zoo/face hunter, which offers inherit consistency due to its lack of any specific cards required for their victory conditions.
TL;DR
Hearthstone is the slightest bit of broken at the moment. Use a low curve with classes that reward aggressive play, tempo, or have strong early removal and you'll usually get more wins.
I see what he's thinking, I just don't think it's possible to remove human judgement and still have a system that works.
Your friend thinks the officer was taking petty revenge.  I don't think that's the case.  The law about updating your license is not a "bullshit law" that needs to be removed.  It's not a law that most people don't follow, and it's not something the officer generally won't enforce when it comes to their attention.  I think that normally the officer never would have noticed that he was breaking that law, but he acted in the most suspicious possible way he could have acted, causing the officer to take a closer look at him.  When the officer took a closer look, the officer found actual, legitimate breach of laws that actually matter.
So under his system he still would have been nailed, and under his system that law would still persist.
I think what's really going on is your friend is butthurt that his hostile handling of authority got him in trouble with said authority.  It doesn't matter who he shows that attitude to, cops, boss, waitress, guy in a retail store, if you treat people like that you're gonna have a bad time in regards to your interaction with that person.  I can't think of anything legal to do during a stop that would have looked more suspicious to an officer, and if you make yourself look suspicious to an officer, that officer is going to thoroughly check you out to find out what you're trying to hide.
***: Your friend does not have a valid point here. His judgement on the topic is primarily driven by his anger at being punished for something he actually did, and his personal desire to shift the blame to the officer, not by a sound objective analysis of how that scenario would play out.

Anyone care to give me the of the new parking policies?
I think we should take the crowd into account. A lot of people said beforehand that coachella was a terrible place for them to start their 40 festivals and I have to agree. Andre kept asking if everyone was "even alive out there" so I think the lack of crowd energy played a big part in their lack of energy on stage. I don't know about you guys but Outkast is the most hyped headliner this year within my group of friends so I think lolla's reception will be better than coachella's. Plus, they've got all summer to work the kinks in their stage act out before performing here.
 coachella wasn't as happy to see them as lolla will be, and they've got all summer to figure it out
OP didn't ask any questions at all. It was a statement. Nothing more. OP was simply making a point to say that he/she was enjoying the slower nature of questing in ESO. 
And for all those people that rushed through the content and are without anything to do two weeks after launch- 
Sucks to be you. The rest of us have a LOT of game ahead of us and when we DO finally reach end game, ZOS will have had plenty of time to add content and By then- 
it'll be smooth sailing, bug free, and full of all the content you're not getting right now.

I really don't like this, hit every person and try, some how, to imply that a currency union might happen.
Its illogical for either Scotland or the UK to have a joint currency. Scotland would want to be inflate the currency if the oil price goes down or deflate if it goes up. Stirling would probably want to go in the opposite direction.
Trying to attach a currency to economies based on different resources is why the Euro has caused so many issues.
But even the Euro had more justification behind it than this, as the German's benefited from cheap exports within the EU and the Mediterranean economies benefited from lower bond prices.

There is no reason for rUK or an indy scotland to share the same currency, until someone can provide a justification for why the rewards out weigh the risks for both sides, its not worth talking about.

I can't get used to this.
A table of, say, 20 sits down. If they all order a soft drink at $2.50 a person, that's an instant forty bucks on the check, or a $6 tip (assuming 15%.)
Now say ten order soft drinks and the other ten drink two beers at $5 a glass. That's a $125 dollar check for drinks alone, or a nice easy $20 tip.
Now let's look at a dream scenario... Ten order two beers each, the other ten share three bottles of expensive wine. You could easily be looking at $150 on the wine and $100 for the beer, or $250 (roughly $40 tip) before you've even taken appetizer orders!
- any drink orders crank up the check and tip which, considering parties are often shared, is awesome.
I gotcha bro.  Not sure how it applies to Australian design, but if you let me know what type (architectural, product, interior) I might be able to help you out.  
Modernity refers to history since after the end of the Medieval age (I think some will say Enlightenment) until now.  Economic (feudal--&gt; capitalistic), political (monarchical--&gt; democratic), cultural (christian--&gt;secular), technological (pre-industrial--&gt;industrialized) changes mark the shift from medieval to modern.  
Modernism usually refers to a cultural movement beginning from around the time of WWI and arguably extending until now.  People use this term in literature and the arts (maybe design?) to refer broadly to changing trends that placed emphasis on the abstract and subjective as opposed to the representational and objective (which are marks of 19th century art and literature, for example realism and naturalism).  In Philosophy, modernism marks a shift away from the rational, toward such models as Marx's and Freud's, which suggest that our reality is determined by forces that transcend human reason (of course there are a ton of philosophers in the 20th century who don't go in this direction, but still the trend is there).
Modernization refers to a process by which societies become modern - this is probably more closely linked with Modernity than Modernism, as it usually denotes technology and economic changes as opposed to cultural trends.  
Again, without know which kind of design you do, I can't tell.  But, assuming we're talking about architecture, I bet there are shifts in architectural design in Australia from 19th century colonial era to the twentieth century era of rapid technological change, Australian independence, and the emergence of global culture/economy.  This shift is probably also reflected in other elements of design.  
 Modernism is a cultural movement beginning at the turn of the 20th century; Modernity is the post-medieval period; modernization is a process by which societies take on the characteristics of modernity
Oh god, this might be ridiculously long, but I'll see.
way back in 10th grade, i met this girl. She was a grade below me,  but not much younger. We'd hang out after school regularly for theater rehearsals. We talked and got to know each other, and i started to have a crush on her. Of course, 16 year old me was an awkward, clueless coward, so I never did anything. We were both on the track-field team, and had a similar group of friends. Eventually, she started dating one of my best friends, but that didn't last the rest of the school year. That summer we hung out more often. We were both in marching band (the best summer activity ever.) 
Cue the next school year. Still just friends, but talking a lot. Typical awkward stuff. Finally, after much berating from my friends, I finally build up the courage to ask her out on a date. I planned to do it at the end of the week, and ask her out to do something over the weekend. The Tuesday before was one of my worst high school experiences.
That morning I'm hanging out with my friends before school starts. We're just chilling, when a girl from the grad above us comes in to talk to one of my friends. They talk, and this girl mentions that her younger brother just started dating some girl. A little further prodding, and it turns out to be the girl I was planning on asking out. My friends give me looks of pity and sadness. I just sat there for a bit, my young heart and soul crushed, the puppy love I had maintained withering away.
So my crush and this guy start dating, and about half way through the school year I do something incredibly stupid. I confess that I liked her (as in "like-liked" her) and we talk. Turns out she probably wouldn't have said yes even if I had asked. Talk about kicking a guy while he's down, that crushed me. Junior year of high school was actually hell.
So, make it through the summer, going into senior year, and I've finally managed to move on. She's still dating the same guy, and I have a different girl who I was planning on asking out. We get about halfway through the year, and I learn that my original crush and her boyfriend are having issues, partly related to how good of friend my crush and I are. He was getting jealous of me, apparently, and didn't trust her completely. I'd never done anything but be nice, so I just laughed it off. Then I once again do something terribly stupid. 
One day after school, they had a bigger fight than usual. She finds me, and we sit and talk for about three hours straight. My feelings for her are brought up, and she admits that she likes me, and did the year before as well.  Now, the timing of this was absolute shit, as just two weeks before I had started dating a different girl. So I was between a rock and a hard place, as was she. After another month of talking, and some more intimate things together, she officially broke up with her boyfriend. She reassured me that the relationship was going bad anyways, and that I wasn't to blame, but I still feel bad since I had a notable influence on the matter.
I have a choice now; dump one girl for the other, or stick with what I have. I'm an incredibly indecisive person, and this was a really sucky decision. Either I admit that I don't feel the same about my crush (which would be a lie), or dump my girlfriend and ruin an amazing friendship (also awful). Ultimately, I did the latter, and I consider it one of my bigger mistakes of high school. It wasn't a bad breakup, but it wasn't fun, either.
We didn't start dating until after graduation, and we date all summer. It starts out fine, but things turn sour really quick. The attraction between us just wasn't the same as it had been, and we grew apart. Less than a month into college I break up with her, which wasn't easy in the slightest. I simply didn't feel the same way about her, and I didn't want to lie to her about something like that. 
Things are better now, and we still talk from time to time. She's moved on, as have I. 
 Liked a girl for 3 years in high school, missed first two chances, hit the third but it didn't work out.
12 PS3 games a month? We've never had that many given on any month... it's always 1-2 (maybe 3 one time, don't remember).
You've got to understand that not all the games you got last month (March) were not necessarily given for that month. Some carry over for the month or next few months. **We only get 2 PS3 games MAX per month**.
This month's games replace some of last month's games BUT when they're replaced depends on where you are. EU is on the first TUE of the month, NA has a game update every TUE.
understand how PS+ works before complaining of the number of games...
First off, as a guy: screw you. What you may seem as serious does not need to be that way. Just because YOU think it should be a certain way does not mean everyone should do exactly what you do. Don't be so self-centered as to think your way is the best way.
Also, who says the man has to propose? Just because it's been done for a long time that way means nothing; diamond rings are recent, and are in no way "traiditional," but I'd be willing to bet that you'd complain if there wasn't one involved, or if it wasn't 15 months of a guy's salary or whatever ridiculous amount it is these days.
 stop acting like you are the ultimate authority on what should or should not happen, and stop being sexist.
P.S. Congrats to the OP and Damonteufel! I tried going to /u/damon_teufel, saw it wasn't active, and thought "oh no, he said no and deleted his account."
This is going to be difficult.  Its... a lot stronger than anything you may have experienced.  In a nutshell, if you've ever smoked weed and can remember your first time getting *really* high, its about 10x that for about 10x as long.  
In its purest sense though, its a mental game.  You have to be mentally mature and in the right mindset.  If you have anxieties or present fears or worries or stresses about daily things, then acid will only intensify those.  But if you go into your trip with a clean slate on your mind (and I mean you *really* need to have NOTHING that you need to worry about getting done that day), with some good friends/company, and thinking "this is going to be an amazing experience for me", then it will be.  
Its a roller coaster of emotions.  You can go from feeling like the luckiest person ever and free from every constraint to feeling alone and then feeling like you just want to hug a couch all within 15 minutes or less.  But if you know what you *want* to experience, then you are more likely to experiene it.  Doing acid inside by yourself can be one of the most anxious experiences of your life.  Your brain will want mental stimulation, and without it, you will dwell on things you shouldn't think about.  And if you're tripping and your mind bores itself, it will create things to keep you less bored.  This is when trips can go bad.  Better idea is to either stay outside (somewhere safe and secluded from public if this is your first time) because outdoors has plenty to occupy a tripping mind -- the clouds, leaves, grass, wind, simply sunlight and the patterns its shadows create -- that will have your mind bouncing from one bright idea to the next.  
The only time I will trip after dark is when I'm going to a (music) show that generally will include lots of lights (think music festival lineup) that continually stimulate your senses.  Holy shit music is something completely else when tripping.  You will recieve a whole new appreciation for music.  Honestly, if there is anything I can say I have taken away from my trips more than anything else, it would be the profound love of different music genres and styles that I have come to enjoy.  
From my experiences, when I get drunk, the same shit happens. I get sloppy and clumsy, get a headache, pee a lot, wake up feeling shitty, and don't remember much of the previous night.  Each acid trip can be very different.  I remember just about everything that went down (not full details, but I know what events took place - just don't overdo it).  You definitely *can* take so much that you essentially black out and dont remember anything, but this is misuse of the drug.   Take a responsible amount (1-2 doses) and see what comes of that.  Try to open your mind for the better. Don't dwell on pessimistic things.  Acid really can be a mindblowingly eyeopening experience if you allow it to be.
After this explanation, it should go without being said, but still ought to be - prepare yourself and know what you're getting into.  Don't buy it from some sketch dude on the corner.  LSD is a very reactable compound.  Things as simple as salt from a sweaty dealer touching the doses with his hand can alter it slightly.  There are also other synthetic experimental drugs that people may try to sell you: 2C-i, and 25I-NBOMe for example.  Best bet if you don't know anyone who can't get clean LSD... wait til you find someone who does.
- Again, it is all a mental game.  Don't do it when you have a lot of stress or worries.  Keep your thoughts positive, and you'll love it.
Oops, forgot 2nd half... MDMA/ecstasy feels like tingly electrical volts running through your body.  Any light touch to your arm feels like half-naked angels rubbing your dick with feathers.  Mix the 'unknown' mindset of tripping on acid with this 'everything-feels-amazing' mdma and you're in for a wild ride!

I want to share a story of frustration, confusion, disgust, stupidity and finally hope!
A little while ago I noticed the beginnings of a cal mag deficiency and upped my dose of cal mag accordingly. Instead of getting better, it got worse and worse, starting on 1 plant and soon showing on 7 more. So I upped the dose again to no effect.
Then I noticed some fungus gnats, and on closer inspection I found a load more. How did I miss em? No idea, but at least I had an answer (or so I thought) to the problem. 
Then it occurred to me that there was way too much damage to have been caused by these gnats - an infestation that caused damage like I was finding would have had clouds of them flying all round my tent and although they were plentiful, they weren´t that bad.
So I did what I should have done from the start and started trouble shooting all parts of my set up. Now I have always had very hard tap water with a pH up to 10 (usually around 8-9 though) but I hadn´t checked what it was coming out of the tap at for a while - I would just pH my water after mixing my nutes, and as I use pH Perfect nutes, my pH was always bang on the money.
I checked my tap water and it is now coming out of the tap at a steady pH 7, so my thoughts are that my normal dose of cal mag used to be fine because of the high mineral content of my water, but as my water quality changed, the minerals were much reduced, and so the deficiency grew quickly, and was made worse by the fungus gnats.
I waged war on the gnats. It was quick, bloody and left many casualties. The girls got a much increased doses of cal mag, and the damage seemed to slow down.
I think its finally under control and the damage, while bad, isn´t catastrophic, I´ve certainly lost some yield, and they aren´t gonna win any beauty contests, but I am confident that they will limp over the finish line in a couple of weeks.
So my stupidity, coupled with a blase attitude almost cost me a tent full of buds. From now on I will be checking every aspect of my grow weekly and I have learned a big lesson!
**- I was stupid, my plants really suffered!**
Ouch. The process is pretty straightforward, and much easier than getting a new one, but it takes quite a bit of time.
To renew a work residence permit, you have to renew your labor permit or foreign expert's certificate, whichever your res permit is tied to, first. That takes about 5 business days.
I'd advise you to head straight to the PSB visa office and explain your situation. Hopefully they can give you some leeway while you get your labor permit extended. They almost certainly won't if you wait and show up with a res permit that expired 1-2 weeks ago.
For the regular process, I can't remember all the paperwork involved, as my assistant does it now. But you basically need to show the labor bureau or FEC folks that you're still working for wherever you've been working, and show them your passport. You'll probably have to give them a few photos for their gigantic laowai face collage.
Then you take the labor permit/FEC down to the PSB with more photos (some places require you get the photos on site), your local registration slip, and a few other things. This now takes 15 days, but they give you a piece of paper to use as ID in the interim.
Usually when the police are willing to overlook a short overstay, you'll need a letter in Chinese explaining the situation.
 go straight to the police station and tell them what happened (or make something up)
I still don't know where that came from!  My mom said that it was pretty normal considering where we were, and I was thinking, 'Fuck, that is the most out of place name I've ever heard."  
 The south is weird sometimes.
Out of the main three parties, I think the Conservative party is the least dangerous party to go with- they have been in power for 8 years so I feel I know what to expect from them, the leader of the liberal party has not impressed me one bit so far and the NDP are far to left to get my vote- that being said anything can happen to change my mind when everyone puts out their official platforms and start campaigning (that's why I said at this time) 
 I feel more comfortable with the Conservative party then the other two large parties. 
Assassination typically involves some degree of political or ideological foundation as far as the motive of the killing, and the target is usually a high-profile figure of some sort. This might be context-specific - we may not considered the death of a small-town mayor as an 'assassination,' but residents of that town might disagree.
Generally speaking, however, a killing is considered an assassination if the motive was based on some form of political, ideological, or financial gain, and the target is of a certain profile to make the killing more than just a personal grudge or problem.
e.g. a person kills Victim A over a disagreement over religion. if Victim A was just your average person, it would probably be considered a murder. But if Victim A was a political leader, it might be considered an assassination. New twist- the killer was Victim A's spouse. Now its not an assassination anymore, its just a murder. Suddenly a Shyamalamadingdong appears - the spouse was paid to do it and had intended to do it all along. Back to an assassination.
If its a high-profile individual being killed for political, ideological, or financial gain, its probably an assassination. But context of the killer as well as what circles the person is considered 'high-profile' also matters
Arcanes-&gt;Force Staff will be good in practically every game.  Force Staff lets you initiate, or escape if you get jumped.  Getting an early Sage's Mask then making it into a Eul's after Force wouldn't be bad (that's what I tend to do on WR), but it might be better to skip Eul's and go straight for Scythe.
 force staff is the best item in the game
Probably not as bad as some, but thought I'd share anyway. 
I was being chased by two zombies, and was bleeding heavily, so I ran up the stairs (zombies in SA can't go up stairs) and bandaged myself. I proceeded to turn around to loot the floor I was on, in the hope that the zombies would go away whilst I was doing so. As I turned around, a zombie glitched through the floor (this happens regularly, but never on an upstairs floor) and hit me, very nearly killing me. 
Oh the joys of an alpha game.
zombie glitches through an upstairs floor. Nearly kills me.
How does it not?  
Konami has clear structured support for tier 1 play. Tournaments are the main attraction in this game, tournaments are completely based on results, results are based on victories. Tournaments have a large population size to ensure that decks who are the most consistent and strongest will prevail. Therefore, Tier 1 decks who are more consistent and stronger than tier 3 decks are going to be played more than tier 3 decks. Konami has banlists to keep tier 1 decks in check.    
You don't see "tier 3 only" or "whoever had the most fun" tournaments. Games are built around victory. A fun game is fun regardless of the format. Thus, tier 1 is the way the game is meant to be played.   
Konami builds it this way because Tier 1 is constantly evolving depending on the new sets as better stuff comes out and the old stuff gets hit. Konami makes a lot of money off prioritizing Tier 1 decks over any other decks which is why they make it the way the game is meant to be played. If people can hold onto their tier 3 decks forever, Konami would just go out of business.   
Sure, you can play the game with Tier 3. No one is stopping you, no one is going to say you shouldn't or can't. Hell, you can play traditional for all anyone cares. But the fact of the matter is, if you want to have fun while achieving something competitively, then you're going to be playing with and / or against a lot of Tier 1 because the game is built that way.   
You can't blame anyone for it. The spirit of competition and economics naturally make it so. Blaming tier 1 decks for "a lack of diversity" is like saying "Chess is boring because everyone knows the main lines to every opening; therefore Chess lacks diversity. Why don't people just play random openings because that's the way the game is meant to be played." 
 tier 1 is the way the game is meant to be played. 
Honestly, I find myself calling decks such as Geargia-Karakuri, Lightsworns, and a good number of high-tier standard/common decks "skill lacking" or "not unique", etc. I prefer trying to make a deck that won't win all the time, but is fun to play and keeps my opponent on their toes/struggling to keep up. These aren't necessarily "rogue" as you say, but mixed usually with an engine from a common deck (such as Cyber Dragons in a rank 5 deck, Fire Kings in a Hazy Flame deck, etc).

I don't personally feel it is because I fear losing to them usually, but generally because it's the same routine over and over, with the same win condition/play style, so it's not fresh, new or fun- it's just who draws into a card to kill their combo(s) first at that point in my eyes. I don't label decks I use as "rogue" nor do I think they are- all combos notably useful in a deck, regardless of its tier, has likely already been used/is being used.

Despite my dislike of the aforementioned tier 1 decks, **I do like and recognize the skill(s) needed for other tier 1 or high tier decks**. These include Hieratics/variants, Chaos/chaos dragons, and the likes. You have to know when to play them and how each step of the way realistically, and that is where the skill and mind-games come into play. These are the few times I enjoy a match where it isn't something "unique" (and I use that term *very, very loosely*), as I get to see if it is straight-up Hieratics, a Dragon Ruler mixed variant/Chaos sub-deck of some sort, or if they are running Beelze/Void Ogre in a Chaos deck, a Phantom of Chaos fueled Chaos Deck, etc. You can never be 100% certain seeing them at the start of the match (usually), and they can surprise you with their lengthy combo(s). *I like that a lot.*

- I take high-tier decks at a 50:50; Generic overly used same-old-same-old bore me, mixed/lengthy or skillful entertain me.
OP - while it's important to worry about your gear, it's even more important to worry about your financial situation. If you do not have **at LEAST** 3k in the bank with all your gear bought, I would consider deferring this hike. 
Long-distance hiking can be expensive for the first-timer, as you're going to find some of the gear you have doesn't work, too heavy etc and need to be replaced. In addition you'll be taking days off, eating/drinking more than you would at home. Most first time hikers (and some hikers in general) spend a lot of their time partying in town - which can get expensive. 
So if you're not financially prepared (not just for the hike, but coming back from it as well) I would push it another year. That's just me.

No worries at all. Sadly, you hit closer to home than you intended. The Blues have been around since 1967, went to the Stanley Cup finals three times in a row their first thee years, and lost all three. They haven't been back since. The year they had the best record in all of hockey, they got knocked out first round. This year, they had one of the best records, if not the best, all season, and lost their last six before the playoffs. We Blues fans are a bit anxious now.
- you were pretty much unintentionally spot on.
My SO and I will meet for the first time in 7 days. 
We did the whole "I love you" thing very early; we'd known each other for something like 2.5 weeks. I'd never met anyone online before, nor done a long distance relationship of any kind; he had once and wasn't particularly keen to repeat the experience, but there was a sort of palpable chemistry when we spoke that neither of us could ignore. From the start we could finish each other's sentences; that progressed to casually saying "I like you" a lot, until I told a friend something that he'd said that made me glow and she responded, "I love him for you." I replied, "I love him too, I really do. But shhhh, we haven't gotten to that stage yet."
I happened to be drunk at the time, and admitted to him I'd said it after he enquired what my friend's response was. After the initial shock of "WHAT IF YOU ONLY LOVE ME BECAUSE I'M BLURRY" (oh, the joys of webcams, Skype, and shit internet connections), he said: "I love you, too, and I've been biting my tongue since about the third time we spoke so it didn't slip out."
When you know, you know. Every relationship is different; there aren't any hard-and-fast rules for when, how, or how soon (or not) to say "I love you." It's a deeply personal thing, and something that I won't say unless I mean it completely. In this case, undeniable chemistry, alcohol, and my SO's pervasive curiosity meant we said it sooner rather than later -- not because the phrase is a trivial one (quite the opposite), but because I indescribably, undeniably knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I *do* love him, even though we've never met. From the moment he first drunkenly told me that he was smitten, I knew, and his voice, smile, eloquence, humour, intelligence, and sexy, floppy hair (shush *it's so nice*) continue to leave me breathless and wondering how I possibly got this lucky.
I just knew.
Here's my experience as someone that bought a lot of AC:
As soon as I started, I bought the highest tier everything, including weapons. I only realized yesterday that by using high tier weapons, you don't get any of the weapon proficiency. So I went back to tier one weapons to slowly increase my weapon proficiency and realized how horrid they are compared to the high tier weapons. I had to spend AC to get most of the weapon attachments so I wasn't gimping myself as badly..
Buy weapons/attachments to level up your weapon proficiency, if you don't want to be at a huge disadvantage.
Depends on how you look at it.  How often do individual cops have occasion to protect individual citizens?  Probably not a lot, I'd imagine.  But how often does the *existence* of cops, and the threat of being beaten and/or jailed by them, keep one citizen from harming another?  Impossible to say, but sometimes, right?
And then you could ask the same kinds of questions about the other side:  How often does one cop actually act to protect another, from accusations of corruption or brutality, or from an attack by a citizen?  Probably a relatively small percentage of their careers is spent on those activities.  But do they know every second that they would destroy a citizen without batting an eye if that was what it took to protect their fellow officer?  I suspect so.
 Who knows.
There's a very thin line. 
The confusion here I think arises from thinking that mind uploading in the future will be something similar to how we upload information nowadays: just plug them into a USB, and transfer to a new device. It's possible, but highly doubtful it will play out like that in the future. I like this topic so much that I don't mind diving briefly into the realm of science fiction and fantasize and romanticize about this stuff ;) . Anyway, here's a few possible scenarios. 
1. **Bioengineering** - In the future, bioengineering will allow us to genetically modify our brain cells to sustain increasingly longer lifespans. In this scenario, humans will move their brain onto new, non-organic bodies, but their brains will fundamentally remain organic (albeit super-engineering to be better, faster, stronger). Humans here will retain their single-threaded stream of consciousness. *This scenario though is fairly boring, because we are still very mortal*.
2. **Nanotechnology** - In the future, nanotechnology becomes the key tech in this debacle. Humans and fellow humanoids across the world will have the option allow tiny nano-robots to enter their brain and transform that gooey and fragile brain matter into a strong, non-organic neural network. This is the best possible scenario because it allows humans to maintain a completely single-threaded stream of consciousness whilst becoming essentially immortal along the way. 
3. **Uploading to a new machine** - In the future, very advanced scanners will be able to map your entire neural topology down to sub-neural detail. This will allow the machine to take essentially a photograph of your entire consciousness, and then move it into an external machine. This scenario breaks the single-threaded stream of consciousness paradigm. You, as a human, will cease to exit, and another vessel that is you will keep on going. This is the equivalent to OP's twin analogy. 
**+ SUMMARY**: Regardless of the method, mind uploading *remains* logically sound. There are no problems whatsoever arising from it beyond the brief existential crises that people will encounter. Assuming the 3rd method becomes a reality, a person will encounter something along the following lines: he/she will lose consciousness in preparation of the transfer to the machine, and will regain consciousness in a new body. It will be the equivalent of someone going into a coma briefly, and waking up with no memory of the intermediate transfer process.
Artosis shows up when he's getting paid, though. I know that people paid for his "starcraft devry university" and it was shitty of him to flake on that, but I guarantee that MYSTERY AZUBU SPONSOR is paying him and Tasteless a hefty amount to start streaming.
There's a big difference between the community throwing money at Artosis based on "come on guys I promise" vs. him signing a contract with a real company saying that he'll stream X hours.
 He can fuck the community over, but he can't fuck people with lawyers over.
As a complete beginner (freshman at NJIT) my biggest hurdle is actually doing some UX stuff. The closest I've come to it now is web development. People are telling me not to worry to much about getting experience now because I'm only a freshman, but I want to be really good at it by the time I leave college and so far I've only been reading and listening to podcasts. No real world experience. What is the best way to get some experience?
 Want hands on experience. 
Telling my familiy I didn't share their faith anymore. My whole familiy are Jehovah's Witnesses. While this might not seem like a big deal to most people, to JW's religion and devotion the the organization is everything. You have to go to meetings weekly, you have to preach, study etc. You are told to limit contact with non-members. Parents are expected to raise their children as JW's. It is the very center of the family dynamic. I grew up like an average JW and got baptized into the faith. But then I had a crisis of faith. I learned things about history, science and the organization itself that shattered everything my life was supposed to be about. I told my parents and they cried. I had never seen my dad cry before. If someone officially leaves then they are shunned, not even family contact is allowed. People are encouraged to shut out relatives and "be loyal to Jehovah.", or else they risked being shunned themselves. On top of that they think God is going to kill me at Armageddon. The stuff they read gets very detailed about how all non-JW's will be killed. It involves billions of dead bodies to be eaten by birds because these people will not deserve burials. 

 Parents may have to shun me, believe god will kill me because I told them that I don't believe in god anymore.
A friend of mine was having the very same issues. We noticed that some instances (maps) would consistently lag and disconnect him, while others would work fine at the same time. Once he got into one of those laggy instances, even a game restart would keep it laggy. He could go back to say a lunaris that was laggy and be disconnected again after some serious lag spikes, then create a new one and this one would work fine.
So we naturally thought it was a problem on GGG side.
after much research and help from the forum, we learned that there were several instance servers (this is quite obvious) at different IPs, and the route assigned by his ISP would sometimes pass through a different router at the peering location between his ISP and his ISP's backbone provider. So when an instance was created on some specific server of GGG, he got the route going through the faulty ISP equipment, and there was nothing to do, that instance was forever laggy/disconnecting.  
As you can imagine, this is pretty annoying when you put that well rolled lvl 78 map in and it turns out to be a "corrupted" one.
So he tried multiple times to contact his ISP (SFR france) customer service. But yeah, you get the usual "did you try rebooting your computer". They simply will not understand or pass the error report up the chain. To this day the problem is still not resolved (that's since the beginning of the current leagues).
But all is not lost, we found a solution ! We usually are on the european gateway, so we decided to switch to the US gateway. There we have more disconnections, but at least once he disconnects, he can reconnect and the instance is not 'corrupted'. looks like the ISP equipment to the US gateway is not faulty !
Once we pinpointed the peering problem with trace and everything, we tried to get GGG to contact the ISP, just like sometimes blizzard does. But GGG is a small company, they obviously don't have the man power to do this.

TLDR : probably not GGG's fault, they could do more about this kind of stuff, but they're a small company
This is an interesting one - you're trying to fit a lot of consumer-grade hardware into cases traditionally reserved for server/OEM/business use, most of which come with terrible fans, awkward component placement etc. I'd be very wary of going ahead with it, especially with your current selection if components. Most of these cases have very poor airflow around the pci area, leading to convection currents causing hot air to pool in the area above the graphics cards. This could be a major issue with SLI 780s.I have yet to see a single case with a 120mm rad mount for your watercooler either. Most of these cases have tonnes of HDD bays at the expense of front intake fan mounts, and rely on usually a single or pair of 80mm fans for exhaust. 
You will probably only get anywhere by making a few mods - a 5u case could have the top panel modified (read: cut a hole in it) to accept your watercooling rad, and you could cut grating into the area above the GPUs to help them. 
My personal experience is as follows: I have a computer with an i5-3550 and an EVGA ACX GTX 770 in a Lian-Li PC-C32 case. The GPU cooler is similar to the Msi one in your build in that it ejects air out on all sides - hot air would pool above the GPU area. This was only fixed by cutting out a window and filling it with mesh to let convection carry some of the heat out. I can see this being many times worse with SLI 780s.The CPU was cooled with a Noctua NH-U9B - the only decent cooler that was also low-profile enough to fit in a 4U case. The cooling performance of it is mediocre at best due to the limited airflow in the case. There is no cable management whatsoever. 
Tl:dr: It won't work unless you are prepared to get your hands dirty and deal with cases that feel a bit like they came out of 2010. It can work if you are. 
Rabbits have a reputation for rampant breeding and they deserve it.  An un-neutered male rabbit will try to screw anything and everything it encounters.  Even neutered male rabbits will try to hump each other.  Rabbits are second only to ducks in the rape department.
  Don't fall asleep naked near a male rabbit.
When I was 18/19 my friends and I used to go to this pseudo underground club(looking back it was just a really big basement underneath a bunch of businesses)  on Saturday nights, it had real dance vibe to it, house music and anything you think you'd hear. Truthfully it was a shit hole, however I could buy drinks in there at 18, so we went a lot. So one week we decide that its Friday and we want to get drunk so why not go to Fusion(that was the name). As we stand in the parking lot drinking our 20.oz coke bottles filled half way with Jack we start noticing the music that we can hear ever so faintly is not what we are used to there. 
So cut to 15 minutes later we are done with our booze and head inside. Now upon first entering we notice the music. Hip-hop only(which I dont mind either), and the Dj is just killlllllin it, working the crowd, scratching hard, crowd is going nuts. So we look around and say fuck it lets do this. The more I walk around i'm realizing that my collard douche shirt is one of four in the whole place. I am looking around at a sea of Fubu and shirts with biggies face and tupacs face. We are the only 4 white people in the entire place. That night I saw some shit, shit I never knew existed. 
The one image that has never left my mind is that I see a group of people circled around the dance floor and I kind of squeeze my way to the front to look, and there I see it. I see a thick sista, thighs and ass that were made for twerking. She is THICCKKKKKKK and she is wearing what is basically a white almost latex/leather looking bikini top and bottom with a pair white hooker heels that had white straps attached that started at her shoe and wrapped around her legs all the way up to her waste. And she is face down on the sticky, beer and liquor filled floor just clapping her ass right at me. Almost like she is giving me a round of applause for being there. I also notice that there is a guy walking around with a video camera just hyped up, going crazy and recording the crowd. At that moment I was trying to decide if I was home or if I didnt belong. 
Walked into a hip-hop night at a club and found a love for thick women and also probably ended up in a hip-hop video as the token white guy.
In Guild Wars there were a LOT of titles, but they were tiered. An example would be gathering 'faction points' for your chosen side. If you had just started, you had the title "Luxon Supporter", but if you put the time (and I mean a lot of time) you could unlock the highest tier: "Saviour of the Luxons". These differences were most certainly noticed, and when you saw someone with a maxed out title it was definitely respected.
The number of available titles just means that people can acquire titles in many different ways. If they just want a funny title they can go out and earn that title. But if they want to show their skill, dominance or devotion to the game they can go and earn a really difficult title. In time, those titles will be known and renown and people will have that "awe" feeling when they seem them. 
 Lot of titles available, some will be very difficult to get and will still provide a sense of awe.
And you are correct.  That is a good continuity error I did not catch.  
**Now, prepare yourself for the longest comment I have ever written on reddit.**
I could offer some ideas for why this would not violate continuity, but of course, none of this had to be taken to be true.
* We'll start with what we do know about the zombies.
1. They appear to be infected humans rather than undead, as you mentioned, which can be extrapolated from the following:
   A. The zombies appear to undergo respiration, as can be inferred by the noises they make.
   B. Zombie location damage appears to be similar to living humans. (Head shots instant kill, can be knocked out for a few seconds)
   C. They appear to bleed which means they have a functioning heart.
   D. This game is meant to have an element of realism, so we would assume a realistic scenario.
2. They appear to be very tolerant of pain, indicating minimal neural activity.  This may be subjective though since it appears as a game mechanic for players not to be crippled by it either.
3. While they can be knocked unconscious, they manage to get back on their feet alarmingly quickly.  This might imply either a different structure of brain activity, such as conservation of resources to only vital systems.
4. Zombies appear to have a very high level of stamina, indicating lack of muscular or connective tissue decay.  Not only further supports the idea that the zombies are infected, rather than undead, but also that they have a functioning immune system, as they are not constantly rotting from bacteria.  This also indicates that the parasite is only infecting the brain, or nervous system, but nothing else.  Otherwise these cells would begin to break down.  Further support for this come from the fact that most infections only target a narrow range of cell types.
5. Zombies have very little or no need for food.  This coupled with the rate at which they exhaust energy can indicate a few possibilities.
    A. The apocalypse was very recent in game time.
    B. The zombies that you encounter were recently infected.
    C. The zombies rely on the breakdown of fats and even proteins for energy, with disregard for the physical effects.  This would further support that they only retain limited neural activity, but would still cause either part A or B to hold true.
    D. They do eat, we just never see it.
6. We have to look at behavior of the infection.  We infer that this infection appears to be a type of virus or parasite or other microbe.  We know that, like other real world viruses, and parasites that "zombify" animals generally do so through multiple stages, though only infecting a single species directly.  This may infer that the infection itself is not necessarily spread by humans, but by other animals that we interact with.  (Perhaps livestock or pets)  These viruses and parasites generally do not spread through the air.  Inferring this virus or parasite is a mutation of a similar acting body, or even if it were created artificially, we would be lead to predict that it does not spread through the air, but instead by either direct blood/spinal/lymph contact, or through a set of vectors described as other animal iterations.  (The E. Coli Bacteria actually does something similar)
7. From the behavior described above, we can build evidence that the player in fact is not immune.  
    A. First, the player relies almost entirely on non-perishable foods or non-meat-based products.  The biggest source of meat for the player would likely be in the Tactical Bacon, which on the can itself says it can be preserved for up to 10 years.  If the infection started recently, and livestock were the cause, the player would be almost entirely unaffected.  Especially if it were only through a specific species of livestock, or a specific part of the animal.  (I know in the mod there are more food options)
    B. Fluid contact as a medium for the virus to spread would be unlikely.  It would have been noticed or discovered early on in the infection, and is not a very easy way to transmit the disease.  Even if zombies were able to attack the populations at staggering rates, local law enforcement would have very easily been able to handle it.  (Considering how easy it is for a single well armed survivor to fight off the hoards).  So this is very unlikely to be the primary means of infection, although, this does not mean that it is not *a* method of infection, and if so, then the player may in fact be immune.  There is not very much evidence at this time to prove or disprove this statement.
    C. The player's initial appearance on the coast, and initial lack of knowledge of the area, may indicate that the player has just arrived to Chernarus.  If so, and if the infection spreads through a medium described above, then the survivor may have simply never been exposed to any virus.
* Now we'll look into possibilities behind how a recently deceased player could reanimate.  The following section contains both realistic, and more outlandish possibilities.
1. [REALISTIC] It may take time for the infection to take hold.  Possibly a method of viral or parasitic injection is implemented by another zombie on a recently deceased corps.  After all, if there do exist some microbes and worms that will alter behavior in very unexpected ways in order to reproduce.  If this were some sort of worm, or larger parasite, and it does in fact target the brain directly, there is a possibility that it could carry with it some glucose energy storage system to keep alive the cells that it needs, or a potassium/sodium/calcium chloride storage system to help it to push back ion gradients in our brains.  If this were so, it could build up enough charge across the brain to shock the heart back to life, like some sort of defibrillator.  In the process of this, considerable brain damage would certainly occur which could also hint for cause behind the decrease cognitive level.  Though this seems outlandish as a concept, there do exist many animals today that can build up electric potentials (Voltage) organically.  Really, the two most improbable things about this are that a creature that small could generate such a strong potential (Though who says it has to be small if it is a worm?  Have you seen the size of some parasitic worm?  Their massive!) and the possibility of evolution of such a species.  The evolution of an infectious worm might allow it to be compatible with humans, but gaining an advanced system for building up high electric potential in only a few short years would be another matter.  (Unless of course you count genetic experiments as a viable origin).
2. [OUTLANDISH] The viral infection could be alarmingly quick.  Causing the infected to not die, but pass out with a dramatically slowed heart rate.  This would be more likely if the player was in fact previously infected, but the virus remained dormant.  Introduction of a new virus to the system could trigger the dormant virus to activate.  Such introduction could be caused by a fatal blow from an infected zombie, or some post-"death" exposure.  The slowed heart rate would prevent any notability that the survivor was alive.  Once the virus activates, it is very quick to spread it all throughout the body. (A ton of them can be made, and held for storage in a single cell)  Attacking the nervous system could later cause the heart rate to resume as normal once the infection fully holds.  This method is a lot less practical from a biological or medical standpoint, and would also cause some continuity issues (Being able to check for pulse, breathing, etc)
* I could probably think of more possibilities, but I fear this comment has gotten a little bit over the top how it is.  Thanks for sticking through it all.  I'd be happy to hear you comments, thoughts, or criticisms about these possible infection mediums, and would greatly appreciate corrections to any of the claims I may have made.

**  It's okay, you don't have to read all of that if you don't want to.  It will better explain what I am trying to say though.  In short, conventional ideas for the transmission of a zombie parasite would likely not hold up in the real world.  Extrapolating, one can find the possibility that the survivors are not immune to the virus.**  If so, I've provided two possible examples of how a parasite such as this could infect a recently deceased corpse.    These should not be regarded as facts about the DayZ world, but only interpretations of available data.  Under these interpretations there could exist methods for a realistic infection scenario. **
I assume that your question is how he seemed to get 99 Fletching after getting all 99s. The answer is that these kind of server-wide messages are handled together and if they happen in the same tick (which can easily be the case here), then they are just displayed in some specified order, which could be like this.
It is not a bug or anything interesting, just slightly strange game mechanics.
Stating your question will help you get answers in the future.
Dude idk why but that seems like it would be a waste to me.. probably will get all soupy and drip down into the pipe and it will hit much harsher than a rig and nail becuase the temp of a lighter flame is much higher than the required (or desired) temp for vaporizing (dabbing) hash oil/wax.
 GET A RIG IF YOU GOT OIL GAME LIKE THAT.
I do have some experience with this.
  
Honestly the best thing to do is put it right on your profile. Top part. Right there. Even if you list that you're openly poly, you need to also list that you're in a relationship.  
I went on a date with a couple and they STILL assumed I was single, even though I put "I am polyamorous" in plain sight. Caused a lot of friction.
  
If you keep waiting for a right time, there'll never be a right time. I figured that out the hard way and ended up dating someone who wasn't totally crazy about my being poly despite all good sense. If I had been open and honest from the beginning, it would have been such a big deal.
  
 Just fucking list it. Less people will want to date you, but it's more important that the RIGHT people want to date you.
My evil narcissistic aunt and my dad's whole family. 
My aunt (dad's sister) never liked my mother since she is a different religion than my dad - although it was never a problem for my dad. But dad was very mild mannered, so he didn't really speak up and my aunt kept butting into our lives to the point where she found a new woman for my dad to marry and *brought her to our house*, lol. I don't know what she was thinking. My mom served them food before realizing what my aunt was up to. Anyway I grew up with her shit, trying to bad-mouth our mom to us when we would be at family gatherings, refusing to shake my mom's hand etc. The rest of the family would kind of enable her. 
Anyway, my dad passed away two years ago. You'd think my aunt would have pity for a new widow. Nope, she went into action the next second. First, lying her way into getting important documents relating to his death and trying to get control of his accounts. Nope, blocked. But then she found a loophole. Her husband, had helped my dad out I guess at one point, and apparently his name was on the lease though my dad had been making the payments. So she made him kick us out of our house and my mom and and my younger sister had to live with my aunt (mom's sister) for a month while I crashed with a friend. This was all while I was completing high school. My mom doesn't work, so it was a kick while we were down. And the family did nothing. We're barely able to make rent each month, and my mom had to take a shitty secretarial job to keep us going. She tried mediating with my grandparents but they're also passive as fuck and take the side of their daughter. 
 I hate my aunt with a passion and will never forgive us for making us homeless when my dad died. 
I disagree! I have alot of good friends and they know I have a big mouth and talk alot of crap, but guess what! When shit breaks down, they know that I'm there.
I'm not the "best" best friend. I'm only human and i say stuff I dont meen. 
I think you just have to be honest about why you do stuff. I always stay behind what I said, even if it makes no sense and was hurtful. 
But honestly, I'm probably the one who says sorry the most..
**Liechtenstein**: One of the many, many princely states that made up the Holy Roman Empire. At some point the Liechtenstein family vassals to the Habsburg that held many lands across Bohemia and Austria and playing a big role in the Viennese politics acquired it the County of Vaduz to gain Imperial immediancy that was somewhat like sovreignity but within the H.R.E.
In 1866-1871 Prussia transformed the loose German Confederacy into a unified nation called Germany. of the many states that formed the Confederacy just three did not unify in Germany: Luxemburg because it was *de facto* Netherlands, Austria because it was a great power and did not wanted to go under Prussia and Liechtenstein becaus it was basically a private property of an Austrian political family. Just after the end of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918 and with the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germani in 1938 the Liechtenstein Family moved to Vaduz and began to be primarly involved with the microstate issues.

**San Marino**: one of the many independent City States of Medieval Italy, not even the biggest of most important one. managed to not being annexed by the Papal States like the rest of Romagna region during late medieval-early modern period.
Then managed to not being annexed by newborn Italy during the 19th century by able political mouvering and due to gratitude by Garibaldi that managed to hide in San Marino while fleeting from the Papal States after a failed revolution.
**Vatican City**: After newborn Italy conquered the Papal State in 1871 they allowed the Pope to remain inside is Palace on the Vatican Hill without interfering but confiscating many other properties in Rome, among them the Quirinale Palace that was the main Papal residence and that become Royal and then Presidential residence of Italy.
Relations between the Pope and the Kingdom of Italy were tense for half a century until in 1929 Mussolini's fascist government signed a treaty that recognized independence to the territories within the Vatican walls thus creating the new State of Vatican City.

If I'm out at a party or I'm just outside around campus (university) it'll happen at least once. That being said, I enjoy it and aside from the ego boost I like to keep it going until the girl breaks it.  
In middle school when I used to be a mall rat I was walking around with my cousin just hanging out at the mall. I saw this group of 4 girls walking in our direction and the one in front was really cute so I was looking at her and caught her looking at me. We kept eye contact and actually turned around after we walked by eachother while not breaking it. Fast forward I got her number, didn't really click so she gave me her friends number for some reason, and then I started "dating" some other girl very shortly after so that was the ended of that.  
when getting eye fucked, eye fuck back, harder. Good things can happen. 
A lot of the comment here are talking about the first order pharmokinetic model. This is a good approximation for the majority of the process occurring in your body. However it doesn't accurately describe what happens once you reach what is known as the boundary conditions for this system, that is to say, it doesn't describe what happens once the concentration gets very low. A closer model will describe the system showing the half life model while the concentration is high and then a different model, likely a flat rate(zero order) model, when the concentration drops below a certain threshhold. 
 your body will eliminate at a half life rate until the concentration gets really low and then it will eliminate almost all of the rest at a different rate once a different mechanism takes over.

&gt; And Tim is the one being made fun of here?
I really don't like how Tim was made to seem like an idiot because it is extremely obvious that he is not. His seating's within Apple have proved that more than twice fold.
In an effort to answer your question and to clarify a misunderstanding I will try my best below:
The Law of Large number states " *...to which the frequencies of events with the same likelihood of occurrence even out, given enough trials or instances.

However there is a difference when you are talking **business**. Gary Gohn didn't "make up" the business' definition of the law. Its a real thing and every company is weighed against it. Apple more so due to it being a shy stretch to $1 trillion dollar market value.
This business definition states (paraphrased) it becomes exceedingly difficult for a business to continue growing after a certain point. For example, 1% today is not the same as 1% one quarter from now.
I really wish Mr. Cohn used the term "The Law of Diminishing Returns" because that is what it really is but in business people tend to swap around words because.. well screw the English language, I don't know.
At some point Apple will hit a wall. They won't be able to grow any further and that is when investor will begin to just ship, thus killing the company. Mr. Cohn was confront Mr. Cook about this particular event.
- The wrong terminology was used during a conference meeting with the Goldman Sachs group and news outlets are jumping on the chance to call out Apple.
There's a bit of a misnomer of "closing" the app. Android is actually very good at managing RAM and running apps. In the app switcher "closing" that app effectively means removing it from that list. In fact, if you close an app, and then reopen it before it would've been automatically removed from RAM, you'd actually be using more battery to re-load the app.
 closing apps/managing RAM on android is not productive, just let android manage itself.
I'm a 502 producer/processor (everything but the retail store). There's a few issues with how things are going.
First off, the unsold "45k lbs" is the outdoor crop. It's not really a problem, it'll happen every single year. However, if you're a producer that needs to pay bills it's easy scapegoat.
Second, a lot of us will fail, mostly in the first couple years. Everyone is in a new facility. Many have never grown more than a closet. How you grow when you're limited to 45 plants is nothing like how you grow when you're limited by square footage. Lots of changes in operation. This has two effects: quality goes down, costs go up. If you don't fail, you'll figure it out.
Third, MMJ is in a weird place in WA. The way the majority of it is operated is just not legal but no one currently cares. Since it's not legal, no one is enforcing permits, B&amp;O taxes, and other fees. They have no testing, security, reporting, etc requirements. They generally sell unpackaged bulk product while we're packaging Gs because the prices are high. So they have drastically lower costs.
Fourth, taxes. They're too high and we're double taxed. Because the seller pays the excise tax, that tax is actually income for the business. A sales tax is not. The IRS only lets us deduct the 'cost of goods sold' which that isn't. Retail stores have it worse, none of their overhead is deductible (ie: rent, employees, their excise tax, etc). 
So right now, producers aren't running at their best and are competing with people that have vastly less overhead. It's $2-3/g more expensive for the producers, and retail stores have to at least double what they pay.
People overestimated the quality they'd be producing this year and are having to sell for a lot less. A lot of people thought they'd be able to grow a lot of plants and sell it all off at $1k+ wet to processors for extracts, they're not moving anything. Others thought they'd sell WA mids (we're spoiled) and are selling normal mids, here that's good for extracts.
That doesn't work. If nothing changes, we all lose everything and the rec sector dies.
In the next year, something will happen to fix this. MMJ and rec will be combined, somehow. My guess is it'll be the rec system with a high sales tax that isn't paid if you have card, all MMJ businesses will be given the chance to become compliant but the vast majority will close. There might be some max thc limits for tax-free cannabis.
IMO, this is all expected. With how the law was structured, we were never going to compete with how the medical industry operates and I didn't think that was the plan. Now that rec exists, MMJ can be brought closer to what CO started with and every other state with MMJ has: some sort of regulations.
 We'll end up with a very similar system to CO but because of where we started, it'll take a few years and it'll be a painful process.
So like /u/bothunter said, a NAS is network-attached storage. It's not to say you can't create a multi-function server. So basically, let's say you have an old computer. You throw a bunch of 2TB HDDs in there and make the drives accessible over your network by connecting it to your LAN. Bam, NAS!
Now, let's say on that same machine you want to also make it a Plex server. You install and setup Plex and then host all your files on there. It's still a NAS but is also hosting Plex.
In my personal scenario, I'm using FreeNAS with hard drives, as well as Plex and a few other applications that FreeNAS supports from within its' ecosystem.
NAS loosely means some sort of storage accessible over a network. Like a computer with some HDDs and is connected to your LAN.

Beat it first try completely blind. First team was Cardes lead, Darvanshel, Rowgen, Ulkina, Zelnite, and Cardes friend, but this team died almost immediately. The team that carried me was the second squad. Lily lead, Narza, Zelnite, Altri, Sergio, Cardes friend. 
Lily MVP
Done with Trial X1, second attempt, one team, using the Single Tilith Infinite SBB Setup by /u/Evangelyn in his/her thread [HERE]( (Thanks, dude!)
Screenshot: 
* Cardes (lead) - Leomurg + Sol Creator
* Tilith - Drevas + Ihsir's Guise
* Narza - Dandelga + Magic Ore
* Belfura - Legwand Gem
* Zelnite - Lexida + Sol Creator
* Cardes (friend) - Legwand Gem + Ihsir's Guise
Item Set: Holy Water x10, Fujin x5, Revive Light x 2, Crescent Dew x 2 (but actually, never used any revive)
First fight, used 1 Fujin on Tilith and SBB/BB spammed Cursed Estia. Finished in 6 turns.
Second fight, SBB/BB spammed Estia whenever possible. The only real problem was Tilith herself being drained of BB gauge, but it was a minor mishap as I just pop a Fujin Potion on her and continue grinding. Then, when I was hit by the buff eliminating move and the immediate Curse on all members (except Tilith who had Drevas), I simply used Holy Waters. It happened once more but by then Estia's HP was low enough to be finished in 3 turns, so I never used any Holy Water anymore and got cleared of Curse on entering the Xestia fight.
Third fight, no real problem except that damage is a bit slow. When any non-Tilith member was partial-drained in the BB gauge, I simply used Tilith's BB. If Tilith was partial drained, I attacked with her that turn and used Belfura and Zelnite to speed up acquiring BB fill for Tilith, and then the SBB spam started once more. Narza's BB charge on attack effect on his SBB was a great help to recover SBB as well.
 Only real problem with the setup was Estia's buff clearing move with subsequent Curse; easily mended by Holy Water. The first and third fights were easy.
In sum, THIS SETUP ROCKS! Really, really great against Light (and potentially, Dark) single boss fights. Only improvement I see is having a Shida replace Belfura and gaining the all-elem advantage with the same BB fill effect. If I had Shida, I'd totally replace Belfura and use this setup in the coming FH11 as well. Too bad I don't have a Shida, though. :-)
We have Upmote, SGA, TLW, etc... So why the hell aren't we replacing TLDR with something like LDR or LDR5001?!

So my boyfriend and I showed up at our target around 5am for the MM3Ds. We were the first to arrive. Our target had 5 systems available.  About 20 minutes later another guy showed up. We ended up making friends and having a great time. We had another guy join us around 6:30. All four us were having a great time and even became Facebook friends. Around 7:40 the manager let us stay in the foyer. Two more people showed up right before 8 and that was that. Tickets were given out for the systems and the whole thing ran very smoothly. We all talked amiibos for a bit after paying. 
Then, at Toys R Us we were only able to secure a Mega Man amiibo because a very nice woman took pity on us.they have out tickets and she and her daughter each had one so she was kind enough to give us one. We hunted around for Sonic but no luck. 
Target was an unexpected pleasure and people can still be nice. Happy hunting everyone! I hope you did everything you're looking for!

A lot of time and money goes into R&amp;D, and they need to pass that onto the customer to remain profitable. why do you think companies are cloning everything, because the R&amp;D costs for clone makers is literally nothing. when you buy a quality authentic a lot of quality control happened that you didn't see. they may have messed up the threads on 2 different mods and tossed them in the recycle before they made yours. having some metal fab background i would say for materials, labor, wear and tear on the tools and packaging adds to 50% of whatever they are charging. then you have a retail front end like a website that could run you a few hundred a month. uncle sam takes %40 of your profit.... 
a lot more than most people realize. 
*i would like to add, that if you don't like the price then don't buy it. its that simple. you are not entitled to authentic vape gear at a price you can afford. 
&gt; "My only question there is, post-apocalypse, are you gonna be a gold guy or a Bitcoin guy?" asked Arrington.
The fact that Paul completely misses the point of that question is all that needs to be said.
Gold has value in a functioning economy simply because it is both scarce and has cultural value.
Bitcoin is on the leading edge of that. It's scarce (i.e. finite) by design, and contemporary culture is lately assigning quite a lot of value to things that exist only digitally.
Neither one of them can actually sustain you in a global economic failure. You can't eat either one, you can't extract energy from gold or bitcoins, and when shit gets real then a pound of beef has real value where a pound of gold is just a pretty chunk of metal.
The only thing of real value is raw square footage of Earth's surface.  And even then, a deed for land is just a piece of paper; you have to back it up with the willingness to use force.
 Currency is an abstraction of value, whether it's gold or dollars or bitcoin. The fact that Paul favors one over the other indicates he just doesn't understand economics.
I would talk to your doctor, but it could a number of things. If your workout is more strenuous than what you were previously doing your body will adjust. I felt similar to this when I first started working out. Are you sleeping enough and well? I ended up flaming out for a while because I was trying to do too much and my sleep was suffering. Or you could be low on Vitamin D. This can make a huge difference in fatigue levels and pretty much everyone is low to one degree or another since our lives are mostly indoors.
 Go see your doctor to make sure it's not something wrong and get your Vitamin D levels tested. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and not overdoing things.
That's dumb. If I put physical stuff in a box in my attic, then my house burns down, same effect happens. 
It would have been safer in a rented garage, in airtight boxes. If you cared about that stuff, you would have secured it better, rather than dumping it in your attic and forgetting about it. Copies of these important things would have also been a great safenet (families do this already, by each sibling or many family members having their own copy)
If you aren't backing up important documents and pictures into multiple places, which include online sources and offline (external), then the data isn't important enough to you, or you are taking unnecessary risks with your data.).
Technology isn't just some magical thing that automates your life and protects you. You must take an active role in backing up things you value, otherwise you are prone to losing it, just as you would with physical things.

**** The problem isn't the technology, its peoples ignorance and naivity that loses data. Having backups and redundacies are key , physical or digital, in protecting your valuable items... ***As some random guy on survival preppers said. "Two is one, one is none"***
Look up Expected Value and that should show you that its many times better for a team to go for it on say 4th &amp; 2 at their opponents 40 yard line, as opposed to punting and most likely only netting a 20 yard punt.   You have to have a *really* good punter to coffin corner on those plays, and teams just dont have that... 
More often than not it is more advantageous to go for it on 4th and short as the potential point swings are larger and the yardage gain is minimal. 
*Every* team should have a game theory coach on the sidelines providing analysis to these situations
Let's take a look at Peyton's playoff losses and see how many you could say he's a big reason why his team lost. 
***1999***- Colts lost to the Titans 19-16 in Manning's first playoff appearance. Manning went 19/42 for 227 yards 0 TDs 0 INTs and a passer rating of 62.3. He also rushed for a TD, however this was an abysmal first playoff outing by Manning. Inefficient at every turn you can blame Peyton for this one, but its his first outing so he gets a pass. 
***2000***- Colts lose to the Dolphins 23-17. Manning went 17/32 for 194 yards 1 TD 0 INTs and a passer rating of 82.0. An admirable showing by Manning in this playoff loss, but nothing to write home about. Not the reason they lost the game, but certainly wouldn't have been the reason they won it if they did. 
***2002***- Colts lose to the Jets in miserable fashion 41-0. Manning went 14/31 for 137 yards 0 TDs 2 INTs and a passer rating of 31.2. Absolutely abysmal performance by Manning.This one can fall on Manning's shoulders. 
***2003***- Colts lose to the Patriots 24-14. Manning went 23/47 for 237 yards 1 TD 4 INTs and a passer rating of 35.5. Turning the ball over 4 times is absolutely inexcusable, this one is on Manning. 
***2004***- Colts lose to the Patriots 20-3. Manning went 27/42 for 238 0 TDs 1 INT and a passer rating of 69.3. Not an astoundingly bad performance, but not a good one either. I think some of the blame for the loss can fall to Manning's shoulders on this one. 
***2005***- Colts lose to the Steelers 21-18. Manning went 22/38 for 290 yards 1 TD 0 INTs and a passer rating of 90.9. Manning played extremely well in this game and I don't see how he can shoulder any of the blame for this loss. 
***2007***- Colts lost to the Chargers 28-24. Manning went 33/48 for 402 yards 3 TDs 2 INTs and a passer rating of 97.7. Not a terribly bad performance by Manning statswise and the defense gave up two TDs to the Chargers back-up QB. But two extra possessions for the Chargers were huge in this so Manning and the defense have to share the blame. 
***2008***- Colts lose to the Chargers 23-17. Manning went 25/42 for 310 yards 1 TD 0 INTs and a passer rating of 90.4. Not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but looking at the highlights Manning gets sacked late deep in Colts territory allowing the Chargers to bring it to OT where they eventually win it. This is another one that's not completely on Manning, but he played a big part in the loss. 
***2009***- Colts lose to the Saints in the Super Bowl. Manning went 31/45 for 333 yards 1 TD 1 INT and a passer rating of 88.5. Again this isn't a poor game statwise, but that one pick that he threw was the backbreaking pick-6 late in the fourth as the Colts were trying to tie up the game. You've gotta put this one on Manning. 
***2010***- Colts lose to Jets 17-16. Manning went 18/26 for 225 yards 1 TD 0 INTs and a passer rating of 108.7. This playoff loss is in no way on Manning in my opinion. Special teams and defense blew this one for the Colts. 
***2012***- Broncos lose to the Ravens 38-35. Manning went 28/43 for  290 yards 3 TDs 2 INTs and a passer rating of 88.3. Again this doesn't look that bad statswise and everyone knows about Rahim Moore's monumental fuck up. However, lets not forget about how kick returner Trindon Holliday kept the Broncos in this game with his two return TDs. Peyton was buoyed by the special teams that day and he threw the game sealing pick in 2OT. In my mind Peyton and Rahim Moore split the blame equally that day. 
***2013***- Broncos lose to the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. Peyton went 34/49 for 280 yards 1 TD 2 INTs and a passer rating of 73.5. Peyton is not the sole one to blame in the thumping the Seahawks put on the Broncos, but he's definitely up there. Just a bad performance all around by the Broncos.
***2014***- Broncos lose to the Colts 24-13. Manning went 26/46 for 211 yards 1 TD 0 INTs and passer rating of 75.5. It doesn't look too bad on paper, but if you watched the game Peyton was off all game long. I don't know if it was because he was playing through an injury or what, but he was painfully bad underthrowing and overthrowing like it was his job. This loss is definitely at least in some way Peyton's fault. 
*****-By my count there's at least 9 of Peyton's 13 playoff losses that you can make the argument that he is at least in some way partly to blame for the losses.
So i've been wondering how all you guys get clips like this while playing, because on Xbox at least i am under the impression that you have to tell/have the Xbox to start recording the clip when your ready, so is there a way to have it continuously recording all the time, and then when you do something cool you just have it keep the clip?? or whats going on? can some one please fill me in??
 How are you guys getting clips like this, when on xbox i thought you had to start recording the clip manually  on your own and end it on your own... do you just have it constantly record then keep whatever you like?
It really was a greedy as hell play. Sneeds is out on the table, your opponent has 19 health. Being able to chunk through that without getting lucky with shredder RNG is pretty optimistic.
Plus, he got punished by a fireball. It's not like he lost to something ridiculous or a bad card. Plus polymorph would have wrecked him, frostbolt would have wrecked him, flame strike would have wrecked him, flame cannon would have wrecked him, and there's probably more.
 He got punished by a card that is an auto pick. Other cards would have also wrecked him. I think he would have been better off hoping for good shredder RNG.
They have changed a lot since that news story came out.
I worked at chicfila for all four years of high school.  I quit when my general manager told me (on a day that i was not working) "take those earrings out, they make you look like a faggot".  They were aggressively right wing..the type of southern when southern is bring used as a bad adjective and not regionally. I worked at a location in Raleigh like the boy in the story, but I am not sure if it is the same one.  They do not discriminate against gays, but they do not approve or like and think it is wrong and sends you to hell.  They are an EXTREMELY christian organization.  Not just anyone can get a franchise by buying one like most fast food restaurants. You have to basically be elected or nominated and so it is a loose network of friends and all these guys hold the same faith as the owner..it is basically an unwritten law.  However, they would never not serve gays or talk bad about them but they just "think it's nasty"  The original owner has since died so this could be different now, because it was years ago that I worked there.  I definitely quit because I felt uncomfortable by their hate speech.  I don't care what someone says to me at all, but I won't work for a company who acts that way...and I was ready to get more than minimum wage.  
I guarantee that when I worked there (and granted "times have changed") but in 2000 (maybe 1999?) to 2004 when I was employed at chicfila,there is not a chance in hell that a person that was openly gay would have gotten hired where I worked.  I would stake my life on it.  How many jobs talk about the ten commandments?
This may only be true for a small region, chicfila has expanded a lot and perhaps is not as "southern" as it used to be.  Good family friend was also a GM there for a while because he had wanted to open his own, he was well above qualified and they would not allow him to get his own store because he had moved down here from New York and didn't "fit the bill"



manager called me a faggot and i quit, chicfila cleaned up act since they were put on a microscope... but damn dat chicken doe
You are correct, a forceful anything does not by itself indicate sexual assault. However, you must put aside your biases (liking light aggression and being forceful with your partner) and consider the context of this relationship. He cannot masturbate without feeling shame. With that in mind, do you think that he would be into her, "pushing him towards the bed playfully and stroking on top of his pants and then aggressively opening them up?"
Read the post with the gender pronouns switched:
&gt; So I have a girlfriend(F 20) and she's a little out of the ordinary. I'd like to say that I(M 19) am pretty normal when it comes to relationships and sex. I have an average-to-high sex-drive and she has the sex-drive that any normal girl would have. Like a lot of girls on /r/NoFap, she feels very guilty after fapping. But the weird part is that she feels super guilty after doing anything sexual too, even if it's with me, someone who it's okay to do things like that with. I didn't really think this was a big deal so far and I kept teasing her and flirting with her until we would do stuff. Keep in mind, we haven't had sex yet because she refuses to, but we've done everything else. There would be a couple of days where we would be very touchy-feely and flirty but then there would be weeks where she won't even let me kiss her properly. Even though this is very demotivating and frustrating, I can deal with it because I like her a lot and love spending time with her even if we don't mess around. Now, the first time I kind of forcefully fingered her and she told me to stop so I did, but then she told me to not stop so I kept going, she finished and then started regretting it a lot. She said that she was going to cut herself in the shower and I started crying and told her to not do it but she did it anyways. After she did it, I was extremely confused and shocked and didn't know what to do. I told her to not do it again and not to be like this because it hurt me a lot. She said that she'd try. Well, recently, I saw more cuts on her tummy and I just didn't know what to say to her so I kinda walked out and we haven't talked for a day. I just don't know what to do, I've never experienced this and I have no idea how to handle it.
&gt; ; Girlfriend feels guilty and sometimes cuts herself after we do anything sexual. How do I handle this?
You cannot tell me that the perception of this situation does not change when the roles are reversed. Ignoring that is disingenuous. It is similar to people who say, "I don't see color." Race exists, gender exists, it does nobody any benefit to ignore them when discussing these issues.
This is not about a gender war. This is about a very damaged man who needs help, not somebody chasing him around to have sex (whether oral or whatever).
My boyfriend and I never get to go out together so for a few weeks we've been talking about Valentine's Day. I was working until six, but no big deal we can go out after... No, there was a blizzard. So I asked to leave work early and left at 4 hoping to make it over to him (hour ride away at least) before the snow got bad.. Then had no ride.
So unbeknownst to me, he did a lot of work to get money from his foster mom - she had offered to put money on his Amazon. He agrees thinking he can get me a sephora gift card (he was going to take me there on Valentine's Day). He said he spent 30 minutes writing out the message on the gift card thinking it would be sent to me as a surprise... You can't buy gift cards with a gift card... So that's gone :( He's really bad at writing letters and stuff like that because when he sits down to do it his mind blanks out so it was a big deal that he wrote such a long message for me. 
In addition he lost power during the storm and we couldn't talk at all. Happy Valentine's Day!
 we've been stuck apart and when he tries to do something sweet to surprise me it doesn't work and he loses everything he wrote to me :(
Oh I've had so many fails.  The worst of them all would have to be when I was in high school.  I was excited to go to dinner and a movie with my 'totally not dating this dude but we hang out together all the time and cuddle on the bed while watching star trek' friend.  (By 'dinner' I mean 'McDonalds'.  We were classy.)
I waited, and waited, and got hungry, and waited some more, and waited MORE.  Didn't hear anything from him, and nobody answered the phone at his house.  Got *really* hungry.  Turned the oven on for a pizza.  Except I'd turned on the stove, not the oven, and I'd thrown my math notebook on top of the stove...
I ran into the kitchen to see the notebook smoldering.  I threw it on the floor and dumped a couple pitchers of water on it.  Singed the linoleum.  Turned the oven on, put in the pizza.  Burned the pizza -- the center was way overdone and I had to chisel it off.  Ate cereal instead.
About six hours after I was supposed to get picked up, his dad called me.  Turns out he'd broken his leg on the ski slope earlier that day and was in the hospital.  I scrambled around and managed to get a family friend to take me up to see him.
The nurses at first wouldn't let me in to see him.  So I channelled my ability to cry on command and said that but I'm his *girlfriend* I *need* to etc etc blubber blubber sniffle whine chin wobble etc etc.  They changed their attitude really quick, cooed at me, said 'he needs your strength, not your tears', and helped me to his room where he was sleeping.  I snickered and waited a couple hours for him to wake up.  (I'd brought a book to keep me company.)
So that's my V-Day disaster. -- Thought I got stood up, set my homework on fire, burned my pizza, and my not-boyfriend broke his leg.  \o/
For smaller promotion like TNA, there's some rub to be had with name-checking and associating talent with the larger WWE.
WWE doesn't need to rub downwards as it's the acme of professional wrestling.  
  
 You can only rub up, but not down.
They're pellets for a pellet gun.  I had one a long time ago that came with two barrels, one for .177 pellets like this, one for .22 rounds.
They're great for target practice (especially for younger people who aren't quite ready for "real" guns), they can take out squirrels and rats super easy with way less mess than a bullet, and the ammunition is unbelievably cheap (about $20 for over 1000 of the regular ones, these polymer tips are much more expensive at about 10 bucks for 100 or so) and plentiful, whereas .22 can be impossible to find in some areas.  The guns are also nearly silent and can be legally fired in almost any area, even inside city limits, and without a permit.  They're also incredibly easy to maintain, with even less moving parts than a regular gun, but offer almost the same amount of customization and choice as the real thing.  The polymer tip is just to help the pellet fly straighter and it gets pushed into the center of the round when it impacts, forcing the round to expand even more than usual since they are made of very soft metal.

- The same thing regular bullets are for, they're just less effective.
I have incredibly realistic, emotionally upsetting dreams almost nightly, and have for as long as I can remember. I would love to be able to lucid dream, because it is awful trying to fall asleep knowing that I'll essentially be stuck experiencing a feasible, realistic horror (often involving terrible things happening to my close family). They come on in a slow way and I feel the passage of time and often experience the time after the bad stuff happens, experiencing waking up for days and weeks and months knowing that this happened and living my life with it heavy on my heart...all in my dream. Then I actually wake up, my heart beating out of my chest, and it's a massive mindfuck of trying to grasp that this is the true reality, because NOW I can tell the difference from the dream wake up and this real wake up, but I felt like I just lived days or weeks or months with this horrible thing having happened. Sometimes I just burst into tears at all the emotions and anxiety I've felt, and at the knowledge that the bad thing didn't really happen, everyone is ok. Sometimes i rush into my toddler daughter's room and lay a hand on her back and feel her soft breathing to make sure that she's definitely, for sure for sure ok. Most of the time, now that it's been going on for as long as I can remember,  I just try to breathe and remind myself it wasn't real, and snuggle up to my husband.
All this happens 4-7 times a week, sometimes multiple times nightly. There are triggers that can cause more of these each night, like watching scary or super disturbing movies, so I try to avoid them. But yeah...you might say it's a fucking nightmare. True story. I have no idea if this is weird or if it happens to most people.
 I've seen some shit but it's not real but it felt SO FUCKING REAL at the time and it's super upsetting and happens almost every night.
One reason that you could have 600 subs modded on your userpage is you could have been around reddit for a long time (multiple years) and forgot about silly one-off subreddits that you made, or that your friend made and invited you to. When you have been a moderator for a long time, you just tend to accrue random subreddits that are dead but you never made private or left as a moderator of.
2) People come up with ideas and go to  and type in a name and then click create. You could mod over 600 subs if you spent the time making over 600, it wouldn't take that long if you had a friend helping. Would they be popular right when you make them? No, that is where actual work comes in. Sometimes you make the subreddit into a success, but more often than not...it ends up as a dead subreddit that just sits on your userpage as one of your subreddits.
3) People invite others that they know to mod subreddits because they know them well and know that they are a good mod and know the ins-and-outs of how to make a subreddit successful. On this site there are really good mods, decent/above average mods, meh mods, and then downright terrible ones. The ones that are really good or decent/above average get random mod invites sent to their inbox all the time.
4) Making subreddits at  for fun because you like to circlejerk and make silly subreddits as jokes that last for less than a day and then never get touched again.
5) Now let's talk if these "600+" subreddits are "active" (you would have to define active in whatever way you want here). Each subreddit has a team that moderates differently; some use the /new queue, some use the unmoderated queue, some make sure that mods are watching the /comments feed, some ONLY are comment moderators and don't have any other mod "permissions" like moderator mail, then there are jobs like designing CSS...configuring bots (the last two are jobs that a lot of people add mods to ONLY handle because they are so important/rare to find in a mod, I know of a mod that is a moderator of 4 default subreddits only because he is a CSS expert/designer for those subreddits), and things of that nature. What if all 600+ of these hypothetical subreddits had 0 subscribers and were just joke subreddits? That completely would invalidate your entire argument.
There's more! Some of these subreddits could have completely lax rules, so a lot of moderation isn't even required in the first place, even if it is a large subreddit. How is that for a curve ball?
6) When you have active moderator teams that work cohesively, you are able to moderate a larger amount of subreddits, the workload for say "50" subreddits is extremely tiny because everyone is doing their fair share of the work in order to contribute and help out to get things done.
7) What about networks of subreddits like The Safe For Work Porn Network, The Imaginary Network, or the few others? They consist of over 100 subreddits but act as one subreddit since each has a different focus, but the same rules. They also have the same moderators because it is just one subreddit, spread out across a lot of subreddits because of their specific topic/focus.
It basically comes down to this, a) Are the subreddits joke subreddits, or serious subreddits? b) If they are serious subreddits, which ones are active and which ones aren't active? c) How effectively/actively are they moderated (if high, this means low workload since the work is spread out among many other moderators for that subreddit even though it may have something like 5 million or more subscribers!). the of "c)" is "how much moderation is required for the subreddit vs. how large the subreddit is vs. how active the subreddit is."
The last point that I want to stress is this: anyone can make as many subreddits as they want. Just go here: 
 and go wild. You'll soon be a mod of 600+ subreddits too!

They may not be all that practical depending on your situation, but the best way to keep it cool is to not overload the system in the first place. If you're running multiple intensive programs, try working on only a few (or one) at a time. Also, try taking short rests during working periods and let your computer have a break.
Unfortunately, this might not be possible because honestly, who in this day and age runs a single program at a time? That's ludicrous. So I would do what other people have already suggested: elevate the fan from the surface on which it rests. You can make this more efficient by buying a compressed air can and just spraying the vent hoods in case there was dust or something hindering the grill.
**- Improve ventilation (clean and elevate fan), avoid extensive CPU use.**
Undervolting! You might not be able to do this with your particular laptop, but it has worked wonders for mine (a few years old using an AMD processor).
The idea is that your CPU needs to be supplied with a certain voltage to remain stable at a particular clock speed. There is some variation in the quality of the individual processors in a batch. This is why some people are able to overclock their CPUs more than others--luck of getting a better CPU. Similarly, there are plenty of chips in any given batch that are capable of running at a lower voltage than others. Manufacturers keep the default voltages and clock speeds the same across the board, though. 
I used the RightMark CPU Clock to experiment with lower voltages. You can set different voltages for different clock speeds that your computer will automatically choose based on how much speed you need. 
Lower voltage = less power = cooler laptop. 
[More info here.]( 
 Supply less power instead of lowering clock speed to keep things running fast and generate less heat!
(Besides cleaning the dust out the hard way) This. I haven't tried one of the cheap ones (which look significantly more portable) but I've got a big one like this that does a great job of dealing with an overheating laptop. That said, it eats up a lot of desk space and isn't portable. Mine is also loud (though that could probably be fixed with some wisely placed lubricant). I would recommend it for gaming and/or a laptop you've effectively relegated to most-of-the-time in one place desktop replacement.
**** first clear the dust out of your fan (see top comment). Then, if you play games or other hardware intensive stuff, get one of these bad boys.
But wait!  They're gonna have a supervisory board some day!  Must be legitimate.  Look how slick the Wordpress template is!
 scam
I haven't seen the episodes with holly, but from her content I've seen she's a great person. Unfortunately people shit on the women in let's plays because they're new and they're girls. If you look at roosterteeth, everybody was bitching about the new people, but more so Lindsay calling her fat ugly and not funny, which isn't true and very uncalled for and completely unrelated. Many guys, and some women don't think women should be or can be funny. Not to mention 80% of the time they go into it expecting to hate the new person, so they convince themselves they do. They hold new things and people to a standard, and the grump women more so seeing as they are married to the grumps and some people dislike them because they're being "forced on us". 
 people don't like new things, they want to hate new women because they're different.
This is hands down the thing that makes me the angriest. I personally don't like Suzy (although she has gotten better) because she cried sexism when people didnt like her on game grumps. I had no problem with her before that, but c'mon act like an adult and take criticism. People loved holly, just because someone doesn't like you doesn't mean it's because you're a girl. Game Grumps has always been about personality and comedy, and Suzy I guess just has a different approach than the other grumps. 
 Just because people don't like you doesn't mean they're sexist, it means they're human being who can criticize. 
Questions, since you're the sigma expert:
1) I thought Alpha was hunky bad boy and Beta was adorable good boy. That made sense to me. Edward and Jacob, Gale and Peeta, we see it all the time in female psychology. What makes "Sigma" different from "introverted Alpha"?
2) Is this is a coherent typology? As in, do people really cluster into these categories? 
For example, I'm attractive, tall, extroverted, thrive when surrounded by other people, and generally the loud center of attention in parties because I'm enthusiastic (Alpha). I'm generally sweet and kind to everyone, not even a touch of dark triad (Beta). My sexual partner count trends (Omega) but that's because of how often I have to turn people down due to humans being disgusting - I've had two wanting to cheat their boyfriends with me, two on self destructive spirals of sex and drugs, two were black out drunk so I didn't accept the consent, so on and so forth. The fact that simply *not being evil* has slashed my partner count by 90% among many other sad facts fuels my burning misanthropy (Gamma). I almost always feel that the LTRs who pass the great filter, including exes, are the most awesome people ever and don't hesitate to say so publicly and shower them with affection and otherwise pedestal them (Delta). My interests are primarily intellectual. I instantly nip the formation of social hierarchies in the bud via humor, sarcastic quips, or simply by laying people's games out explicitly...which gives me the reputation as the one with the conscience and I've been told that people are a little afraid of disappointing me. I have a reputation for non-conformity and not caring, and have experiences most people would consider trauma (Sigma). Then again, unlike Sigma I don't stick to any particular "tier or "league" and am happy to date "down" of I like someone.
Whichever one I pick will correspond to which positive qualities I like the best about myself (Or, if I'm feeling down, the negative qualities I pay most attention to). When I first read this, I found myself instantly gravitating to Sigma because I like to think I'm such a genius, but really I'm pretty extroverted and people-oriented and I don't have "4x average" partner count or any such nonsense. Being the weird nerd, I certainly can't lay claim to "alpha" in the "football star" sense.
When it's just alpha &lt;-&gt; beta, things make sense. We're saying something useful, we're positing a trade-off between two positive traits. It's clear that I'm naturally more "beta", since I trend more towards LTRs due to being kind and loyal, as opposed to being flashy, superficially romantic, always approaching and seeking hookups. It's clear what sorts of behaviors one can do to move from one category to another. 
 This expanded social heirarchy stuff doesn't really do that. I can easily convince myself that I am in any of them. The vast majority of people should be able to identify themselves in Delta. Do they? Can you convince us of the usefulness? Aren't people just picking Sigma and Alpha because they are the most flattering ones? Especially Sigma, on the internet, most people think they are smart...
-are you speaking Game talk or Straight talk here?
Monastery Mentor is bad in Delver, and I'll tell you why.
Delver decks want to run a low land count, 18-20, since they also want to be full of cheap cantrips.
Everyone and their brother played against Delver in the past three months.  Everyone knows how the deck works.  That means that everyone knows that as soon as you see a Young Pyromancer, you kill it.  Like Young Pyromancer, Monastery Mentor dies to all the common Modern removal--Path to Exile, Abrupt Decay, and Lightning Bolt.  Delver players know that that Pyro and Mentor are both very vulnerable to removal, so the smart play is usually to slow-roll a Pyromancer until you have 3 mana, guaranteeing that you can at the very least play something in response to their immediate kill spell and get value.  So, that means waiting until you have 3 land, in a deck that's only running 18-20.
That's totally doable.  But let's look at Mentor.  Now you're running a 3 color deck, instead of a 2 color deck.  You don't want to add more land, because your namesake card is still dependent on there being lots of Instants and Sorceries in your deck so that he turns into the fly from hell.  So your mana, and your deck in general, becomes less consistent purely by putting Monastery Mentor in your deck.  Low consistency is always bad, but it's doubly bad in a tempo deck that's relying on slipping through cantrips.
On top of that, if you want to make sure that you actually get some value out of your Mentor, you have to wait until turn 4, minimum.  Since  you only have 18-20 lands, it's probably closer to turn 6.  A tempo deck doesn't want to be making tokens on turn 6.  It wants to be firing it's last bolt into the opponent's face for lethal.
 Monastery Mentor, by requiring a third color and costing 3 instead of 2, makes R/U Delver a much worse deck overall.
From what I've played it's remarkably stable. A good chunk of posts on this sub are just people bitching about the few minor bugs, and on the whole CMDRs are cool in game, unless they're griefers. In response to the bugs you mentioned:
* the ships randomly exploding was a collision bug that was patched a few hours after our first big update was released
* unclaimable bounties was patched in similar speed
* again, some CMDRs are jerks and log out, but most keep with the realism and take the consequences of losing a dogfight. Sure, Frontier could place penalties for leaving combat, but I feel that it'd be cheap and difficult to determine when the player was either (a.) ditching due to losing, or (b.) being disconnected from the server due to internet issues/has to urgently leave the computer. 
However, on the game design side, there is still a lot lacking. In other words: it plays fine (bugs get patched reasonably quickly/is extremely well optimized) but the things you do ingame get dull pretty quickly. Here's two posts that describe this scenario pretty well - [Article 1]( [Article 2]( - but what they basically say is that there is little gratification in playing for a long period of time. You start poor and have to grind either trading/bounty hunting/mining to make enough credits to outfit a bigger ship. And what do you do with the bigger ship? Grind some more, to get an even bigger ship. And the big ships are outrageously priced, and there are few ships between the 300,000 credit price and the 1,600,000 credit price. 
As well, the only activity that you can do better with bigger ships is trading, as they have larger jump-ranges and bigger cargo holds. For mining and combat, the best ships are between 140,000 and 300,000 credits. Any bigger and it's too expensive to maintain, and too sluggish to do well against these two, much cheaper ships.
The for the game design side is "It's a mile-wide but an inch deep." That means that you can do a ton of things, explore literally billions of systems, and see thousands of space ships, but everything becomes relatively repetitive over time.
In my opinion, it's a fantastic game, but I'm a weirdo who's cool with grinding and the design issues. I just like an immersive space game, which Elite is *par excellence*. Finally, if you want another opinion, check out this [review]( This guy has a pretty well-formed opinion of good game design.
Hope that helped.
i would say 7.62x39 is a cheaper caliber and i like it better personally. the AK i went with is the  Yugo N-pap from century arms. its fairly cheap but its a great shooter.  after market parts are a bit lacking atm but are catching up but if your just gonna keep the parts already on it i would say its a great choice. and you can save money for ammo and mags   or   if you want wood
 if you want black polymer
 if you want an underfolder.
there are many different sites you can get these for about the same price as i know some people dont like classicfirearms but i have not had a problem with them.
 
 Yugo Style AK in 7.62x39. get good rifle, save money for ammo and mags
I've seen random non-bowler people shoot north of 250 throwing house balls on several occasions. The one that stands out was a random college kid who bowled a 267 with a 12lb house ball, just throwing it slow down the center.
I saw a 160ish house bowler who stood right of the 1st dot &amp; threw straight at the head pin, bowl a 299 once.
There's a 220+ average bowler in a league I bowl in that uses the "fill ball" technique of throwing it straight down the middle w/max speed a lot, &amp; he strikes doing it an alarming amount of the time.
Even a "straight ball" has revolutions, &amp; on uncountable occasions I've seen full-rollers shoot 300. Full-Roller = Technically 0 spin.
TL/DR: Yes. While I'm not sure 0 angle &amp; 0 rotation is 100% possible, it'd make throwing strikes a lot tougher.
From the Sil., from Of the Sun and Moon, "Arien...was chosen..., being from the beginning a spirit of fire, whom Melkor had not deceived..."
And, from Valaquenta, "For of the Maiar, many were drawn to his splendor... down into darkness; and others he corrupted afterwards to his service by lies and treacherous gifts...among these spirits were the Valaraukar, scourges of fire that in Middle-earth were called Balrogs."
Now, I know that I am speculating a bit here, but from these two quotes, I have always assumed that Balrogs were spirits of fire that became evil, but not spirits all such fire spirits became evil (At least one did not). Further, unlike what was proposed in other comments, some Maiar "fell" into evil AFTER entering Arda. Not all had made their decision before becoming incarnate.
The Balrogs were the "spirits of fire" that turned to Melkor.
&gt;This is what a fascist government looks like in 2015. 
Not even close. Fascism is a political ideology where corporations and other representative groups (eg labour bodies) work together for the good of the whole. Fascism isn't Market driven.
What Abbott and friends want is a return to the class structure of the early industrial revolution. But this time they will use technology to prevent labour from organising.
 Authoritarianism != Fascism.
GP idea 2: extensions to Willow Creek. Since WC kind of reminds of the French Quarter in LA, I think we should add a Southern flair to it. I think a nice little swamp neighborhood would be cool. This would constitute of a hood that is mostly swamp (beware of crocodiles), but also a house where a voodoo witch doctor resides. Snakes are now a collectible and currency for anything witch doctor related (potions, tarot card readings, voodoo dolls), and you can now cook frogs. Also new: the ability to make pitchers (from the classic small pitchers, to the fancy big dispensing ones you see at parties, as well as dispensers that you see at sports games) of drinks that include lemonade, sweet tea, flavored iced tea, sports drink, and spiked punch; New ability to smoke meat, which you can barbecue; **New ability to craft whiskies and bourbon**; New recipes: gumbo, crawfish etoufee, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, hush puppies, buttermilk pancakes, bread pudding, Mississippi Mud pie, banana cream pie, pecan pie (new cooking ingredient- butter); new Southern restaurant venue; Mardi gras themed items and clothes; a jazz club venue, with brass instruments and a bass
I have formatting issues and can't get bullet points to work, so  add southern flair to willow creek, which reminds me of NOLA
Modest Mouse,
First, I would like to say that I like your band. Any and all criticisms I make are because I like yall and yall like constructive criticism apparently. 
The song was at first interesting, sounding kind of like the Strokes. It is apparent yall are trying to be different, but does it pay off here? Yes, I kept listening and after the intro was done I had already invested too much time to turn back now.  Once I got used to the fast paced vocals, I began to get into the rhythm, which doesn't take long because the drum is fairly consistent and the riff is fairly basic.  This is a good thing because it is easy to understand, but it is a bit repetitive for a 6 minute song as it has a standard chorusy structure. I know yall know its repetative because yall threw in some synth and what not, which was cool but only for a second.  
Overall
Song: 14/20
Relisten value: 2/5
 Good song but it follows the formula too closely.
Best Wishes
She is a very attractive woman who has dated a couple of pretty famous dudes (dudes who i can only assume dated/married her  mostly because of her very ample butt and curvaceous body).
She is famous for being famous and being very attractive.
TLDR Version:
Attractive woman dates/fucks/marries famous dudes, ends up becoming famous by association.

Not always: I fell in love with the Ogre gunline and never looked back. It is never as bad as a dwarf gunline, in fact it is the opposite of the skip movement phase, skip magic phase, shoot style of the dwarves because Ogres have movement 6, decent magic and great magic items (everyone loves the hellheart but Grut's sickle is amazing, even for those times when it costs you a game by murdering your general for you).  
It is also different from the Wood Elves', vulnerable hit and run style, since if your opponents do charge you, they will still have to take down a bunch of T4 S4 monstrous infantry with a ton of attacks and stomps.
I take a list that looks something like this, varying for 2-3k:
Core: 50% gnoblar trappers 50% a little bunker of 6-9 guts or bulls for the Slaughtermaster, bsb and Butcher.   The bunker only engages to mop up, or if otherwise unable to get away, however, if it does engage, the bsb should be able to do a good amount of damage from the back rank, while the butcher can accept pesky challenges that get past the champion, being likely quite useless and disposable (I hate lore of the Maw: odds are you won't roll Trollguts and all the other spells are very meh: stubborn, +1 str, +1 T, or just bad like the ultimate spell, while the lore attribute never seems to matter except when it hurts your caster, since they are probably not out there getting wounded in the first place, but in a bunker casting spells.) 
L&amp;H: The Slaughtermaster takes Lore of Heavens (amazing for ogres) l4 and Grut's sickle, all others are basically naked (GW or ironfist and heavy armor for the bsb, a dispel scroll or if I can somehow fit it in, hellheart for butcher)
Rare&amp; Special: Two Ironblasters, two units of 3 leadbelchers, sometimes a scrap launcher, sometimes a Thundertusk, always 5-6 Maneaters with poison sniper brace of pistols.
The way the list works is: Slaughtermaster summons comets to force the opponent to move where you want them to move, nerfs their shooting and buffs your's. You shoot, but unlike a dwarf list, you never stay still. 
All our units can move 6' and then shoot, except the gnoblar, who are only there as speed bumps and bothers. 
The whole army moves rapidly, firing all the while, all but the Maneaters, who occupy in a central location, ideally a building, and effectively turn into a 24' radius circle of inevitable death for enemy mages, unless your opponents commits enough force to take them down.
If you run into a unit blocking the way: charge it with everything, especially the Ironblasters get forgotten for the awesome s5 chariots they are. Usually ogres can puncture a hole in a flank and then turn around and shoot the rest of the enemy army while it approaches. 
E.g. Once the deployment was the scenario where one person deploys their whole army first and gets first turn and I was not that person.  My opponent, playing dark elves, assumed that I was going to put all my shooty forces on a defensible central hill behind a river and aimed his whole army at that hill.  
I deployed everything but the gnoblar along the open left flank. 
Each turn, I moved my entire army and fired.
Each turn the left flank of his army died in droves, while the right flank marched across the board, trying to turn around and come at me. Sealing the deal, I got off a Comet of Cassandra, putting it exactly where his units needed to go to participate in the game.
I made it behind his line before meeting any serious resistance.

you can do a lot of weird things with an ogre list.
p.s. almost no one buys the GW maneaters at the cost they are, you buy 6 bulls and bits from the other armies: lizardmen banners and shrunken heads, Empire guns, Skaven weaponry and rats, etc and make your own!
I think you can add to that moral reason, the simple litany of its ineffectiveness as a deterrent (and the immorality of using it as such in the first place), its exorbitant cost, and the inability to correct an error in its application.
Making people feel good about "justice" being done is not a basis for social policy.
[Here's some crime rates] ( When you compare Poland to Estonia in these charts you will see that Poland seems safer except burglaries - we have some more. But you will also see that we're one of the safest countries out there.

Even though Alej doesn't seem to be used, in Spanish it would probably be pronounced /alex/ (ironically).
That's an IPA transcription, so I'll explain each letter.
Imagine a thick Boston accent, the "Pahk yah car in Hahvad yahd" kind of accent. The "ah" sound in "Pahk" or "yahd" is /a/.
/l/ is just an l sound.
/e/ is similar to the vowel in "bed", but with your tongue higher up in your mouth. (If you're Australian, it likely *is* the vowel in "bed"). Another way to look at it is that in English, the "ay" sound like in "lay", is a diphthong, meaning it's actually two vowels in quick succession. The first vowel is /e/, the second one is the vowel in the word "in". Just pronounce the first half of the diphthong and that's /e/.
/x/ isn't an x sound like in "Alex" it's actually the same sound in the German pronunciation of "Bach" or the Scottish pronunciation of "loch".
Congrats! You can now say "Alej" like a Spanish speaker! If only Alej were actually used...
 Alej sounds like Alex, but with the ch sound in "Bach" or "loch".
It's just as 88MilesPrower said:
Clean your cartridges.  
A Nintendo will take whatever electrical current it can get, and most of the time display whatever it can read... this often lead on the NES to a lot of bizarre and garbled screens even though the game was clearly 'playing'.  The Retron 5 doesn't work this way, however.  It needs a good connection to accurately dump 100% of the ROM into the internal system memory.  If you don't have a good connection, it can't pull everything it needs to before allowing you to play.
As a word of warning, if you already put a bunch of games into your Retron 5 that are dirty, I'd try to clean the gunk out of this pins.  Use a card that's sturdy, but thinner than a credit card.  Take an old, thin undershirt or a really thin microfiber cloth, pull it tight around an edge of the card, and insert and pull it out about 10 times across the length of the pins.  Get some of that gunk out of there.  
This is why so many old NES pins went bad... people blew in their games, it caused rust to form on the pins, and then they started inserting that crap into their machines.  
What you can do for the game pins is take some isopropyl alcohol and apply it to a cotton swab, and then rub those contact pins clean.  Under a light, those pins should look like brand new shiny gold strips.  If you see ANYTHING on them, keep cleaning.  
If that doesn't work, you may need more drastic measure, which would require a retrobit tool (a screwdriver so you can open up the carts and have direct access to the game board inside), and some metal cleaner or Brasso.  Apply the Brasso, start to rub away with a cloth until the copper pins are clean again, and for good measure you can do a gentle cleansing with some alcohol afterwards just to make sure there's no residue left behind.
This is something we all pretty much learn when we get into retro collecting.  Clean carts = clean and happy consoles for life, pretty much.  88MilesPrower sort of downplays the importance of clean stuff a bit with the 'clean your cart crap' comment, but it's necessary.  
- Your cart is dirty and now so are probably your Retron 5 pins.  Despite what we learned growing up, never blow in your carts to clean them.  Ever.  Instead, use alcohol on a cotton swab or even some Brasso if you have to.  Clean hard, and game on.  
Holy crap, so many! I love this subreddit but because of the way reddit works it's all about new stuff, so I don't really see a lot of the older games I love get mentioned a lot... unless they're things that have had a huge far-reaching impact on the hobby (like Settlers) or keep coming back into print. It's not really a surprise that things that are OOP don't come up so much here.
* **Crokinole** is understandably not a hot item here - it's large and expensive, but it's hands-down my favorite dexterity game.
* **Tichu** gets some love, but in general it seems like more abstract card games (like most trick takers) aren't super popular here. We've been playing this game at our gamenights for eight years now and it still gets weekly play.
* **BattleLine** sometimes comes up under 2p recommendations, but nowhere near the amount Jaipur does. I *vastly* prefer BL.
* **Survive: Escape from Atlantis** also sometimes makes an appearance here, but nowhere near the amount I'd bring it up as a perfect gateway or lighter game.
* **Catacombs** is another one of my favorite dexterity games, though the 4th ed ships soon and has HUGELY improved art so I'm hoping to see it get some more love here!
* **Cartagena** is one of my favorite fillers. It's basically like an advanced candyland with a lot of tactical fun. Short, simple, full of fun options.
* **The Big Idea** I see Snake Oil mentioned a lot, which came out after this and is more widely available so no surprise here - but I think the rules in this version are superior as they're a little more flexible. You can just play it with Snake Oil cards though.
* **Mu** Another trick taker, another favorite. &lt;3 Used to be sold in a collection called Mu &amp; Lots More which also contained the excellent games Njet and Was Sticht?
* **Sticheln** The trick taker our group has played the most of after Tichu. It's a little less deep than Mu, but has a SUPER interesting strategy that is basically ass-backwards from every other trick taker out there and is deliciously evil. Scales really well too. It's an import item though, so not surprising that it doesn't come up here.
* **Santiago** is one of my personal favorite Euros. It's short, simple, and *highly* interactive - there's a bribery element which is lovely, but you are also open to negotiate at any time and doing so is really what makes the game shine. I still see it at my FLGS all the time so I imagine it's still in print.
* **Dream Factory** aka Hollywood Blockbuster aka Traumfabrik (which is the edition I have.) I see Ra come up a fair amount when auction games are brought up, but not this other Knizia masterpiece. I think it's had a hard time staying in print though. The movie theme turns some people off. :(
* **Zendo** I LOVE logic puzzles, and this is basically the best one I've found in a board game. **Ricochet Robots** (seen mentioned a few times here) is a close second, but is less player-driven/creative. It uses those Treehouse (aka Icehouse) pieces that are little plastic pyramids and it's so much fun if you're into puzzley brain burners.
* **Blokus** Pretty rare that I see abstract games mentioned here. Sometimes Hive and Hey, That's My Fish! (which I love) but that's about it. Blokus is one of my favs - highly confrontational and so simple anyone could play.
* **Big Shot** Took me forever to track down a trade for this - it only ever had one print run. But it's amazing! So evil. It's an auction/area majority game where your opponents get to place *each other's* cubes in addition to their own. It's quick, dead simple, and super interactive. Love it.
* **Big City** was supposed to get a reprint some years ago from Valley Games that just became vaporware. I scored the original in a trade and really like it. It doesn't scale super well, but with 3 it's delightful - fun options and just enough screwage.
* **Goa** Great classic Euro. I imagine this got brought up a lot when Z-Man reprint happened a few years back (before I found this sub). This one held up a lot better for me than Puerto Rico or Caylus.
* **Quantum** Newer game on the list. It's kind of flawed (kingmaker issue with 3-4p) so I can see why it's maybe not super popular, but it's also got a *really* clever design and really fun. It's short enough that the kingmaker issue isn't a dealbreaker for me, but I still like it best at 2p for that reason.
* **Lifeboats** I've seen come up a couple of times, but it's one of our group's favorite negotiation games. It's just so delightfully evil. **City of Horror** is supposed to be similar and I've seen that come up a little more, as it's newer.
* **Linko!** is the newest game on the list, and doesn't have great distribution. :( Another abstract card game though so I'm not sure how much love it would see anyway. It's like a super confrontational rummy variant and I really like it.
* **PitchCar** also doesn't come up a lot. It's kind of expensive though, and you need a big table. But classic dexterity fun.
* **Riff-Raff** is my favorite newer dexterity game - it's import-only but not super hard to find online (I got mine on Amazon) but it IS expensive.
* **San Marco** was my first "grail game" and it took me years to score a copy. I've only played it once (3p is not a popular number for me) but I adored every second of it. It's like a lighter El Grande with a fun I split/you choose mechanic.
* **Sleuth** I love deduction games and this is one of the best. Can be very brain-burning and require really meticulous note-taking (something I love doing). A little more straightforward and less high-concept than the deduction games I've seen on this sub.
* **Snow Tails** Sadly didn't stay in print very long - there's a sequel which I've heard is not as good. I think this is my favorite racing game. I like the hand management aspect a lot, and it doesn't drag like Formula D.
* **Genoa** Super hardcore trading/negotiation game. EVERYTHING is up for trade, very brain burning and kind of long but also one of a kind!
* **Yspahan** First game I've played with the dice-as-actions system. Much shorter/lighter than recently popular ones such as Castles of Burgundy. Not super deep but packs a lot of punch into 45 minutes which is always a plus.
* **YINSH/ZERTZ/DVONN** Again don't see a lot of abstracts here - usually just Hive for 2p which maybe has more depth and variety, but I really like the simplicity of these.
* **Jungle Speed** is the dex game I've seen come up the most here, and one of my favorites, but again I don't see it mentioned nearly often enough ;)
* **Traders of Carthage** True story, I had trouble getting into Splendor because I wondered why I wasn't just playing this. Doesn't scale super well though, unfortunately. Will probably get some more attention when the remake Traders of Osaka hits later this year.
* **Can't Stop** My favorite press your luck / abstract dice game around. I enjoy this much more than Incan Gold, for example. 
* **Intrigue** Evil negotiation at its finest.
* **Wildlife Safari** aka Botswana/Loco/Thor (I've got the Thor edition). Great filler, along the lines of No Thanks! - made by Knizia.
Until last year, I was also alone in my love of **Hart an der Grenze** an amazing silly bluffing game... but fortunately it got remade as **Sheriff of Nottingham** so now everyone can share my joy! I haven't tried the new version yet (not really interested in buying it because I prefer the theme of the original) but I'm so glad to see it get some richly deserved attention.
Also this sub isn't super into party games. I understand they're pretty divisive, but I actually really like having a big variety of them for when the mood strikes or when I'm playing with non-gamers and want an excuse not to have to suffer through Pictionary, Cranium, etc. Favorites include **Time's Up** (based on the parlor game Celebrities - basically taboo+charades, the latter of which I generally hate but this game builds up to it in a way that makes it work and results in hilarity), **Who? What? Where?** (drawing game where you have to draw random people/actions/locations together in a scene), **Why Did the Chicken...?** (deck of cards creates random jokes, players have to write their own answers and read them aloud), **Attribute** (CAH/A2A style game but with far better replay value - 1 player thinks of a topic, and the rest have to play an adjective that either *describes* or *does not describe* the topic, and everyone has to guess at which adjectives describe the topic via a dexterity game), and **Wise &amp; Otherwise** (basically Balderdash but with extremely weird, obscure proverbs from around the world).
 I like trick taking games, dexterity games, and party games more than most people apparently. Also I've been in the hobby long enough / am an active enough BGG trader to have a lot of older OOP games.
Holy shit, that's awesome. I don't entirely understand a lot of the data, but it's well presented, with a nice TLDR for idiots like me. 
Nah man you may get lucky they may just mess with you like they did with me
Story time if you wanna read it:
I was taking a train back from NYC I was bringing back a little souvenir never had a problem on a train before so I didn't think much of it get to the rail waiting in line with my pops up comes a fucking K-9 unit  of three (3 dogs 6 cops) and they're just fucking standing there now I'm high as shit when this happens 
 a 7 or 6 1/2 from a whole cookie i had a few hours beforehand  I suddenly went from being on Mars to staring at the floor of a train station trying not to make eye contact with these cops 
The real kicker they totally knew i was not all there they kept pointing and laughing at me to themselves pops said it was probably the  funniest thing he's ever seen me do *and i got my party favors back home without any searches*
 cops will totally freak you out and make fun of you for it
Great question, basically, as we all know, North Korea does not have a government that is highly favorable towards, or tolerant of religion (besides their Juche ideology). So effectively all of North Korea was technically placed under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Seoul, even though there are no functioning Catholic churches in North Korea.
The little enclave (green) is the [Territorial Abbey of Tokugen (aka Tokwon)]( which ceased to function after Christians were driven out in 1949. However, the administrative unit continues to exist and is still directly under the jurisdiction of the Vatican, making it a top-level unit.
 North Korea is in the Province of Seoul, except an old abandoned abbey that is still its own subdivision.
atrubetskoy got the basics correct, I just wanted to jump in on the difference between a diocese and an archdiocese. One thing to remember is that bishops are ordained like a priest is, so they are able to do things that a priest cannot such as confirmations (priests can only do confirmations with permission from their bishop), ordain new priests/bishops, and be a local church leader. What that last thing means is that the bishop is the highest leader of a physical location. All bishops are the highest authority in their diocese and with the exception of the pope, no one controls their decision making for their local area.
In contrast, any other titles for bishops are purely administrative in nature. An archbishop is head of the provinces you see in the map, but he is not able to "order around" bishops of the subordinate dioceses. What he does do is try to facilitate the surrounding dioceses to work together. However practically speaking, today archbishops are mostly treated just as bishops of larger and/or historically important dioceses (appropriately labeled archdioceses). An archdiocese is head of a province, but is independent. For example, I am in the diocese of Cleveland which is subordinate to the archdiocese of Cincinatti in the Ohio province, but Cleveland is not part of the archdiocese of Cincinatti itself.
This extends to Cardinals who hold a special position either as archbishops of important sees (the archbishop of New York, Washington D.C., and Boston are usually cardinals for example) or as administrators in Rome. You may hear about a cardinal in Rome giving "orders" to a bishop, however this is not the cardinal himself. The cardinal will be part of an organization like the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith or the Congregation for Bishops. This organization exercises the administrative powers of the Pope, and the cardinal is essentially a very large, very important administrative assistant since the Pope has to oversee the entire world. A bit much for one man to administrate.
FUN FACT: All bishops must be bishop *of somewhere*, so even the cardinals in Rome who don't run a diocese have territory they are techincally the bishop of. Often these are in the middle of nowhere, some are dioceses that don't exist anymore and have been taken over by other dioceses, and I met a retired bishop who's titular diocese is underwater.
 The difference between priests and bishops is theologically important. The difference between two different bishops is they exercise complete control over different territories. The difference between a bishop and archbishop is only administrative, and often simply nominal.
Cynic here. I think the problem has more to do with those in office continually catering to special interest groups who, in return for various legislative favors, throw their support (and the votes of its members) behind that representative. This wouldn't be as big a deal if people would actually get out and vote, but voting turnout is the US terrible. People don't vote. In presidential elections, turnout generally hovers between 50-60%. In this past midterm election, a whopping 36% turned out to vote. So when you've got several special interest groups getting its members to throw their votes behind a Congressperson who has been acted favorably to that group, which can translate to hundreds or thousands of votes, and 60%+ of the population is staying home and not voting, it's no surprise the same people keep getting elected. It's easier for us to get on our computer and repost articles on our Facebook about how much we don't like Congress than it is to actually do something about it and try to fix the problem, and voting isn't mandatory like it is in, say, Australia.
Americans are lazy.
If you have enough memory locks it's a non issue. 
Granted, yes getting this initial set up does take a while, but once everything is where it needs to be, you dont need to take a lot apart (depending on method of travel)
For example back when I still had my pearl soundcheck (set up exactly the same but I had two 10" toms 12", then16") on a pearl Icon rack ; since we had a little covered trailer for gigs, I would just simply take off toms and cymbals, and leave tom and cymbal arms attached (I would 'tuck' some things to make it skinnier) and set it inbetween gear so it would fall. Come show time, I would find a corner to put toms and cymbals back on, then me and another person could take the rack with everything set up on stage so I would only have to fit my bass , snare and Floor tom into line
 long initial set up, quick repeat set up once memory locks are in place
**Extremely slow** - Can't react or influence the game like a IS-3/110, 50 100, or even a T32 can. This is a hugeeeeeee liability. 
**Mediocre gun** - Im actually not extremely familiar with the gun, but from experience fighting it, it's nothing to be too afraid of. Im guessing it shares characteristics with the T32, in which the T32 wins out with the hull down capabilities and mobility.
**Armor**- The armor becomes somewhat irrelevant with someone who knows where to shoot it, gold rounds, or a combination of both. Like /u/xNovember said, all you really have to do is prioritize other tanks, and leave the KV-4 alone until it's time to cleanup for an easy kill. 
All it has is armor, which can be easily countered. Other than that, it has nothing that the other tier 8 heavies can't do better.

It's not repairing damaged DNA so much as enabling the immune system to zap it. [NCBI]( [Cancer Active]( [Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center]( [Cancer Research UK]( Preliminary research seems to point to it being a way to heal that is less cancer-prone. There's very little literature against it, so I'm going to take the plus. It can't repair damaged DNA, but then again nothing that I know of can. 
Lidocaine overdosage information can be found on [Wikipedia]( though it's a bit vague. Commercially sold bottles of aloe with lidocaine usually have warnings against overapplication.
 There's a lot of early evidence for what I'm saying, but nothing against. It's also erring on the side of caution. 
Biking to work is the BEST!
Looks like many people have already covered the basics, but I'll add a few things that help me:
-Keep work clothes at work, if you can. I've only forgotten my work pants a couple times in 3 years of bike commuting, but both of those times I was *very* thankful for having a spare change in my drawer. If you are in an office building, blazers or sweaters are also GREAT to keep on the back of your desk chair in case you forget a shirt. Everything looks business-y in a blazer!
- Keep toiletries at work. My partner doesn't have a shower at work, so he keeps a wash cloth and some deoderant at work just in case. Baby wipes are probably useful, too.
- This isn't intended to scare you, but take your lane (ride toward the middle of the lane). It's the safest place to be. I know that it seems counter-intuitive, but if you are riding farther in the middle of the lane, cars will pass you safely and you'll feel great. If you are hugging parked cars off to the shoulder, you are going to get doored. Also, if you are hugging the shoulder, drivers will try to *squeeze* around you even if there is an oncoming car instead of waiting until nothing is coming. By biking toward the righ-center, you are making the decision easy for them by saying "if you don't pass me safely, *you* will have to be the one that risks getting hit (by the oncoming car). I've had many friends get doored, and thank god there was no car coming behind them or they would have bounced directly into traffic. Once I started taking my lane, I felt much more confident and safe riding.
don't ride where you can get hit by parked car opening their doors.
- Try to stick to lower-traffic roads if the route allows, even if it means winding through neighborhoods. What is best for a motorist is not always best for a cyclist. Sometimes I catch myself taking my bike routes while I'm driving and am like "why the eff am I taking Floyd Ave. to get through the Fan?" I think Asterion7 bikes in southside quite a bit, so he might be able to give you some good pointers on the route. I think Jahnke has a trail-thing that runs near it for a bit, but I'm not sure if it connects where you need to go.
-I think doing a test-run is a good idea, it will help you explore your options without having to worry about being late for work.
-HAVE FUN!
I was active duty Army from 05-09. The most incompetent soldier I met was our 2nd Lieutenant. He was 21 and graduated early from college with a degree in Chinese anthropology. Like many, many, many, people who joined the Military during that time frame, he joined for the wrong reasons. He was never interested in being a leader, molding young soldiers into men, or even the Army in general, he was interested in getting his student loans paid off, thats it. And now, 10 years later this dirtbag is probably in a more important role, but instead of student loan repayment as his motivating factor, he is counting the days he can retire and be a manager of some home depot somewhere. And worse part of all is that unless he fucks up majorly, he is going to continue to be promoted as he continues to put in the years.
 the army is riddled with people who joined when the incentives were great. Now they are stuck with a large group of soldiers not interested in being soldiers.
That shit happens. I was a 1LT fresh out of pilot school (with -- you'll never guess -- a Chinese anthropology degree, of sorts, from *a goddamn academy*). Zero real military experience, let's be honest. My leg got busted up and long story short I couldn't fly, so they figured "Well, let's just put him in Stan Eval, you can do that sitting down." So it became my job to run *all* the goddamn paperwork for the whole training wing. I had 2 hours of on-the-job training, followed by six weeks in a hospital bed, and then straight into the bureaucracy (which is like the Air Force version of combat, I think). I was worse in StanEval than Johnny Manziel in the NFL. 
TLDR butterbars are useless enough on our own, and they love to strategically position us to suck even harder.
I can answer one of those.
&gt;Why is the hostility so great for people who believe in creationism.
It's not. It's great towards those who jump up and down like children and try to force you to believe it with no evidence. That extends to all Christians, and all people of all religions. I'm personally an Atheist, but I don't come to your house screaming that Richard Dawkins is going to shoot you with his laser vision if you don't repent and believe in evolution.  There are some who hate all of them, but I'd bet the greater majority of those people are just fed up with the most vocal and ridiculous of them.
It's not about the belief, it's about those who won't shut the fuck up.
[Most jurists of the classical era of Muslim scholarship opined that music is forbidden both by the Qur'an and by the Hadith.](   
Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of Muslims (the sane ones) ignores this completely, to the great benefit and pleasure of millions. :-)  
And even back in the ["old days"]( Muslims (esp. in Andalusia) mostly ignored this. That's how the West got stuff like the guitar, the bass drum, and quite possibly even the solfège musical notation (do, re, mi...)!  
  
 ISIS are idiotic assholes. 
And to dd what Yeti100 said, [cocaine is not a banned substance "out of competition", even though they tested for it.](
&gt;The UFC is informed of Jones' positive test, but because the testing was done "out of competition," the commission is unable to punish the fighter because cocaine is not a banned substance out of competition.
Is administrative oversight. Is normal.
I have all sorts of dreams some awesome and some disturbing or straight up horrifying. 
I think it's tricky business trying to interpret dreams, maybe especially so when they're your own. 
 
So while I keep a dream journal, I don't really consider my dreams a reliable source of inspiration. 
edit: I don't pay them any special attention in most cases. Like intrusive thoughts while meditating, you can let them go. 
I like running the strikes and crota with less than a full team, so yes, it is an issue for me. It may not be the point of raids for you, but 2-manning crota has added a TON of enjoyment to the game for me. But even if you do run a full team the current matchmaking system will not work for raids or even nightfalls (IMO). 
Who's the fire team leader? Who decides when its time to boot a jackass? When everyone is sick of him do you have to go to orbit and rematchmake?  Are they going to implement some kind of voting system? If someone leaves or gets discod are they going to add someone from matchmaking? Do you just have to sit and hope someone gets added to the group?  What if that person wanted the templar checkpoint but got added to a group at atheon? Does he now have to go back to orbit to try again? I realize he can just use a lfg site to find the right checkpoint but isn't the point of in game matchmaking to dissolve the need for the external sites? 
Why not just make it optional, the people who like the idea can use it, the people who don't, won't. There's plenty of people on both sides to still easily find a team. 

current matchmaking would suck for raids, I hope they make it optional and add a ton of features before even thinking of adding it in.
How much rice go for right now (I checked before posting...about 5-7 mil, probably on the lower side trending down) The rest are worth ...well..less than they were a week ago lol.
45  using them for ~150-200k ea or alts?  If it wasn't via alts and just use a single legit account then that is about 7-9 mil spent let's say..cut it I. Half and go 8.  If you got good deals on them and only paid maybe 100k per, then it's considerably better and closer to 4.5 mil probably.  1 greene (1.5mil if u sell now, prob more like 1.4 mil), 3 vick (400k per x3=1.2mil), no idea on trash legends and not gonna look...let's say avg of 200k (it's probably less) ...200k x 4 is 800k.  

So without rice, golds, or other elites that is about 3.5 mil.  From what I am seeing on ah it's about 6-6.5 mil for rice or so.  in short, without pulling rice, you lost a Considerable sum of money unless you were getting them at cost.  
Basically, the issue is that fewer and fewer legends are actually big money...and you can blame that on the very reason you could pull so many...alts.  be it ppl making alts or buying from them, they lower the market.  bad for ppl trying g to pull, good for ppl just trying to buy.  
- the rice pull saved your packs from being a net loss. Rice alone prob paid for the pack spree.  Whether he is worth the money to keep is a whole different story though.

Of course, you very well could have pulled 2 good cards and made it more than worth it.  Other than the non-rookie legends I assume drop rates are the same between legends (maybe not new legends though...those are probably heavily weighted).  Alts make it cheaper for me to  uy the legends straight up...so I can't complain too much.  It's the glitches that are the more annoying thing...anything that raises prices or hard to obtain items really.
Glad u were happy with the pulls!
My town was actually featured in an SNL segment because of this. St George, Utah.
I went to the city hall and people were dancing out in front of it, it was great. City hall changed it IIRC because 2 people were break dancing outside of a building, and the police came and ticketed them. They went to city hall to argue over the fine.
 I live in the footloose town.
Edit: link: 
Last month my friend and I were driving to Chicago from the Quad Cities to look at a 350z he wanted to buy because he sold his jeep and wanted a car. So the plan was to drive his uncles 98 ranger he had been borrowing to chicago, buy the car, and I drive the ranger back home while he drives the car. Simple right? 

So the next morning I wake up and get dressed for the day and he calls me and says "Dude the truck is dead. Can you come over and jump it?" 

So I went over to try and jump it. It's only a few degrees above zero (Fahrenheit) this morning and this is not how you want to start your day off when you have a long day ahead. He has his uncles cables with the truck because the truck is known for dying because the battery hasn't been replaced in forever. We hook up the cables and try to jump it. Nothin. Turns over a few times and dies. Check connection. Let charge for a few minutes. Try again. This went on for about 30 minutes before we gave up and went to my house to try and use different cables. Which worked on the second try.

Finally. Now that the truck is started we can get on with it. I go back to my house to drop off my car while he goes to the bank. He picks me up and we're off. He drives quite fast all the way to Chicago (actually Elgin, Illinois) and eventually is slowed down because the wind is really picking up and blowing snow across the freeway. We continue on and the wind just keeps getting worse and worse. We pull off the freeway onto a 2 lane highway that goes to our destination. And... it starts snowing. Like a lot. Plus steady 40mph winds. I have him pull over at a gas station so I can take a piss and we continue on again.

So we keep driving down this 2 lane highway towards Elgin for about 20 minutes and snow is just blowing freaking everywhere. We're doing a steady 45-50 mph just cruising along not taking any chances. We're about 10 minutes away from out destination and we're driving down a pretty straight section on highway doing about 50mph when someone is a Subaru Forester pulls out onto the highway from an adjacent intersection. My buddy slams on the brakes and they lock up. All the while I'm thinking "You fuckin dumbass why would you OH SHIT WE'RE GONNA-" Crunch.

Fucking T-boned the person in the Subaru doing about 45mph. Both vehicles totaled. No one hurt fortunately. We stand out in the 40mph winds and snow trying to exchange insurance info and stuff for about 45 minutes. Finally a tow truck shows up and and hauls both cars away. We take a cab to the place selling the car.

But wait, the story hasn't even got bad yet.

So here we are. 3 hours from home. It snowing lightly and the wind is insane and he's trying to buy a 350z that we get to drive 150 miles back home. 

So, the car goes pretty smoothly. He buys it. And we're off again. But there's something about the car that i'm uncomfortable about. Did I mention that it has summer tires on it? No, not all seasons but real, hard compound, summer tires. Fuck.

That was a long drive. We took the interstate back home. Only took 6.5 hours (normally a 2.5 hour drive). The wind was blowing a steady 50mph with god knows how fast of gusts. It's dark, it's snowing, it's insanely windy, and we have summer tires on a rwd car and 150+ miles to drive. Let's do this. 

30mph. That was MAYBE the highest speed we got going with an average speed of about 15mph. You couldn't see more than about 20-25 feet ahead of you at a good moment. Sometimes the rear end would start sliding out just from the wind blowing so hard. Did I mention my buddy isn't the best driver? It was a goddamn nightmare.
 
We left home around 10am. Got home about 11pm. How we didn't wreck on the way home was a damn miracle in itself. 

Also, when I got in the truck when he first picked me up I noticed the passenger side airbag wasn't on (it was one of those single cab rangers with the off/on airbag option.) so asked if he could turn it on but that would mean turning the truck off to use the key. Which we both agreed was a bad idea because it might not start again.

edit: I thought it was noteworthy to mention that ranger only had 65k miles. She had so much more life left..
 
driving to chicago to buy car. Get hit with bad weather. Get in a wreck. Buy car. Drive home on summer tires in blizzard. Nearly lose sanity. 
Alright so about a decade ago I was driving a 1991 Eclipse. It had some basic mods and made around 400whp. I was used an LM-1 Wideband if anyone remembers the big handheld unit. Well, I was in a Pop Boys parking hanging out with my fellow ricers when a supercharged CRX wanted to race.  
The problem is I had been drinking and a friend of mine was driving me in my car. He said he could handle it no problem so I thought FANTASTIC let's do this. After talking with the CRX owner we settled on terms and decided to make a run. I hop in the passenger seat, my buddy gets in the driver seat and starts it up. I was as giddy as a school girl because I had never raced with someone driving my car.  
As soon as the car starts I smell smoke. Drunk me doesn't think much of it. That's when I noticed the passenger side carpet was on fire. The LM-1 unit I had, had managed to get a cut in the wire. It managed to start a small fire. This is right when I noticed smoke coming from the engine bay. So he shut it off we jumped out, popped the hood, and I started trying to put the fire out with my shirt and a bottle of water. Thankfully, I got it all out.  
 The fire had traced itself into the engine bay follow all of my gauge wiring. So my boost gauge, oil pressure gauge, wideband, and IIRC EGT gauge were all fucked. Nothing worked. I didn't see any other damage besides my ruined shirt. So, I disconnected everything burnt and decided to race anyways. Well after 30 minutes we lined up and he lost by a couple bus lengths.
 Car caught fire, still was able to race and win. 
This happened a few days years ago... I was driving home from school and it started to drizzle a bit, it wasn't horrible, just a little sprinkle. Mind you i was driving a 1995 Toyota corolla with all season tires on. When i got to an intersection where i had to turn right, I slowed down to make the turn, mind you i was going ~15 mph during the turn. All of a sudden my back end kicks out and im sliding. Im at full opposite lock trying get control of my car again when i finally manage to get grip. It wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't happen right in front of a cop and within inches of his door. Needless to say i was pulled over a few seconds later. The cop said he never saw anyone else try to drift that intersection, especially when one was right there. He told me that it wad pretty coll and never to do that again before i could get the shit out if my pants and tell him it was unintentional. I later went to my work and saw him again and we traded car stories. 
 a normal drive home turned into an accidental gymkhana skit and i met a really cool cop and learned that high quality underwear is worth its price. 
So I used to drive a 1999 Ford Ranger. I put that truck through some shit but it still runs really well other than burning some oil. 
So one day I get a call from my buddy who wants to hang out. I let him know I had to change my oil and I would be right over.
I finished changing the oil, pulled the stick to check the oil level and all was good. I headed off to my friends house and was about a couple miles away when my brakes started acting funny. I had to compress them almost all the way to the floor to get the truck to stop. Of course I just play it off as the truck having another small issue that I will have to fix later.
I pull up to a light a couple blocks away from my friends house and notice smoke coming from under my hood. My brakes are hardly working at this point and I know something is wrong. I say fuck it anyway because I am almost there.
I pull up at my friends house with my brakes barely working and smoke billowing from under the hood. I jump out and pop the hood to a huge fire! I am freaking out at this point because, being a teenager my freedom to go where I want and vehicle to get to work, is on fire! I run to my friends house and bang on his door several times. Of course the fuckers selective hearing acts up and he doesn't hear a damn thing.
I run back to my beautiful truck that is on fire and rip my shirt off. I was able to beat the fire out but I completely ruined my shirt.
I come to find that the dumb ass who changed the oil, that would be me, left the dipstick out and it had slid in between my battery terminals and my battery had melted itself and caught fire. The stick was also laying across my brake lines which were red hot. That was probably why my brakes weren't working.
So I climb in my friends car, who finally decided to answer the door, and we went to Walmart to replace my battery. I show up at the Walmart auto department shirtless holding a battery that is nearly disintegrated and ask for a new one. The look on the guys face was beyond priceless.
I bought myself a new shirt while I was there and we headed back to his place. I installed the battery and she started right up. Luckily the fire didn't really burn anything but the battery and after it had cooled the brakes worked just fine.
My truck caught fire because I'm a moron and the people at Walmart probably think I smoke crack.
Rollin' down the street and the car stalled.
That's odd, I shouldn't be out of gas.
Coasted into a parking lot and popped the hood. Entire top of the engine was in flames.
Ran to the gas station, borrowed their fire extinguisher and put it out. 5-10 minutes later the fire department showed up. Had it towed home, replaced all kinds of shit (carb, distro, lots of wires, etc) and got it running again.
Bought a fire extinguisher for my car the next day.
I was driving home from school one day when I was 17, drove some shitty 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I got on the highway and was driving like 10 over the speed limit when some bro in his charger comes up on me like a bat out of hell and starts riding my ass. 
Naturally, being some cocky kid, I proceeded to break check him and slowed down to like 35 in a 70. He couldn't get around me because of traffic so I assume he just started fumming. Anyway, a mile or two down the road and he finally has an oppening to pass me. I figured he would flip me off and be on his way.
NOPE!
This mother fucker passes me and proceeds to slam on his breaks and come to a full stop on the highway. Gets out of his car with a baseball bat and approaches my car, his girl gets out and starts calling after him (I can only guess to get him to stop).
Anyway, I didn't let him get close, I just backed up and turned around to go the other direction. Maybe threw in a little bird action as I was leaving lol.
** Some jackanape rides my ass while I'm already speeding. I fuck with him a bit, he tries to fight me on the middle of the highway with a baseball bat.**
Just happened to me. Wednesday 2/18, I was on my way to work in my Audi. As I pulled away from a stoplight, I had catastrophic transmission failure. The car would not engage any gear. I put my hazards on and drove to the shoulder, where I called and waited for roadside assistance. 
I rode along in the tow truck to the shop where they said it was most definitely the transmission. The car has 265k miles on it, it's worth about $2500 and it would cost $5000+ to buy and install a new transmission. Essentially it was totalled...
I need a car for my commute, so I immediately got onto auto trader. I went through a few subarus, bmws, volkswagens, and eventually Mazdas. I found a Mazdaspeed3 with only 61k miles for sale for a shade over $10,000.
I called the 'dealer' to find out that the 'dealer' in this case is actually a startup focused on helping private parties sell cars. They even bring your desired vehicle to your address so you can test drive the car without ever leaving your home.
They showed me a pre-purchase inspection, full service history, as well as all the rock chips, nicks, and wear that one would expect to see on an 8 year old car. We took the car for a drive, and wow it felt like a brand new car. 
I asked them to hold it for me while i applied for a car loan and arranged my own pre-purchase inspection at the local Mazda dealer. They brought the car to that dealer for me, where the inspection revealed no issues. Now, you're looking at the proud owner of a 2008  Mazdaspeed3.
**** Audi broke down Wednesday, Test drove a Mazdaspeed3 that day, got it inspected by a shop today, and will take delivery in the next couple days.
I don't have any experience with the competition kit, but I do have experience with their duty / carry kit (DCAEK) which is currently installed on my Shield. The DCAEK didn't really change the stock Shield trigger all that much. It did make the trigger have a crisper break and the lighter spring did make the trigger noticeably lighter. For carry purposes it works very well, and I am happy with it. I imagine the competition kit would work in much the same way. It wouldn't really expect it change the characteristics or the timing of the trigger, but it will make the trigger crisper and lighter.
The forward set trigger is a whole different animal. It changes the characteristics and timing of the trigger a lot. The trigger has a built in stop to shorten pre-travel over the stock trigger. It also has a built in stop to eliminate over travel. Mine starts off with about 1/8" of pre-travel and then you get to a very predictable wall. Add a little bit more pressure and the trigger moves another 1/16" and breaks the shot. Reset is short and brings you back the 1/16" back to the wall. It feels a lot like a two stage trigger and total travel is minimal. Trigger brakes at the lower end of 4 lbs. I haven't done this nor do I plan on it, but I know that you can buy the competition springs from Apex for around $30 and then you can reliably bring the forward set trigger down to sub 2 lbs of pull. 
I'd also like to recommend the Apex RAM. It works as advertised and gives you a nice metallic click and a little bit of tactile feedback when the trigger resets. 
Competition kit lightens and chrispifies the trigger while the forward set trigger gives you the same and reduces trigger travel. 
I had difficulty. Everything is easy except getting the front roll pin back in while holding the trigger in place (which takes a decent amount of force because of the spring tension). Drifting the rear sight was easy, since I was doing the installation at my dads house I used his vice and I already had brass punches. 
However; once I had installed everything and put the gun back together I realized that something wasn't right and the striker wouldn't cock. I finally gave up and took it too a gunsmith and had him install it. When I was picking the gun up afterwards I asked him what I had done wrong and he said he wasn't paying attention when he disassembled it so he wasn't sure. 

* The "how to" videos all kinda suck
* You do need some tools/experience
* It can be frustrating if the slave pin doesn't work
This whole thread is a "FUCK MIKI" and a "Miki is great its just circumstances!!" so I feel a need to give my 2 cents, even if it adds nothing to the discussion. 
I would never condone hating a player on our team, so pls stahp
I've stated that I believe he is leaving this summer, because I get a vibe that he wants to. 
Anyway, I can see why people dislike him:
1. Record Transfer fee, didn't even come close to his predecessor
2. Horrendous form, 0 goal 0 assists all season despite 1506 minutes on the pitch. I believe that everyone else but Schmelle and maybe Pische has scored at least once, and I know that Schmelle and Pische have some assists. 
3. I honestly think that ever since the Real game, he has been scrutinized more because he put the spotlight on himself. That's all I can think about
4. Kagawa. We had to 'fix' Shinji, and he performed better in his return than Miki has all season. Miki was forced to live up to the heights of Shinji and that other guy.
5. We skipped out on Eriksen for this guy. Half the price, statistically worlds better, albeit I haven't seen Eriksen play so I can't judge.
6. Kevin De Bruyne. You're lying if you wont admit he is better. Mou was a cunt, so now we have a (unfair to miki) comparison playing and destroying the same competition.

Counterpoints:
1. Its completely unfair to judge him against 2012 Shinji, and tunnelcunt.
2. Everyone was shit in the beggining of the season--not as poor as miki though--also, could other poor perfomances have been inspired by lackluster playmaking while reus was kill? idk
3.He has never been anything but happy to play for us, he deserves the same respect.
He doesn't deserve the shit he gets, but he also has played like shit. I dislike his play, but feel nothing but compassion for him. I hope that he gets his Shaktar form, even though that's unlikely. I pity him because a lot of it isn't his fault, but if he played almost as good as Eriksen, De Bruyne, Et.c then he wouldn't be in this situation
Now I think we should part with him, as this is poor for his career and he ins't the player we needed. That's just my personal opinion on this.
 Miki has played like shit but doesn't deserve half the shit he gets
***THE NUMBERS FUCKED UP NOT MY FAULT PLS FORGIVE***
Based on the matchups this week:

C9 &amp; TL have been looking shaky and since they are facing CLG and TSM respectively, they will most likely go atleast 1-1. This means you'll probably get similar points for your top/jungle/support. Mid is where you'll get a lot of points with TSM likely to 2-0 and GV against T8+TIP could result in bloody games. For the ADCs/flexs, I think that CoreJJ is the weakest out all of them. For team points, TSM should score higher. 

 TL/C9 players are meh, TSM/CLG is good, WFX/GV/TIP high reward if they win, DIG???? 

Enjoy the experience above all else. Beyond that - don't get discouraged from anything, it doesn't matter if its a poor touch, losing possession, or even if its just some players playing at a higher level than you are. Keep confident. Be aware of your position, who is around you, try be 3 steps ahead of the play, keep your head up while on the ball, know who you're going to pass to etc. 
Really the best thing you can do is just mentally prepare yourself. Meditation would work well right now to try and alleviate any anxious feelings you have. 
- stay confident, dont get discouraged, and enjoy the experience 
I wasn't thinking about the effects on the moral compass of normal people. I was thinking about bad apologetic arguments like "morality needs divinity", which normal religious people are taught by the clergy after skeptics ask for justification of their beliefs. Normal religious people can feel why it is wrong to act amoral (maybe they need an incentive to act moral). A psychopathic person doesn't feel it and has only punishment as reason to refrain from amoral behavior.
I think that originally, before Christianity was an established religion, people were attracted to it because it demanded the observance of moral rules, the validity of which were self-evident and a big advancement compared to the barbarism of the Roman empire. There was no need to define morals, there only was a need to oblige to moral rules everybody agreed upon. So first come morals, then comes religion, then comes clergy, then come skeptics, then comes apologetics. Normal people use these bad arguments not because they are psychopaths but because they are part of a system in which bad arguments are spread by psychopathic authorities. Normal cult members are not the psychopathic ones. They are the uncritical ones who are grateful for any argument that helps to quickly overcome their cognitive dissonance without having to face the brutal reality of giving up the cult.
For normal people religion enforces morality. For psychopathic people religion defines morality. Normal people use the arguments of psychopathic people to defend their religion against skeptics.
Dutch guy here: I love Italy, and am disgusted by what these scumbags have done. However, both the Dutch and Italian police have made mistakes here, the Italian police should have never allowed these hooligans into Rome itself, and the Dutch police / security agencies, should have warned Roma police they were coming in such great numbers.
Than again, I do not want to be accountable for these losers, they should pay for this, but they're probably on wellfare, so the Dutch tax-payer will pay the bill, which pisses me off.
 Dutch guy, disgusted by these idiots, absolutely love Italy and Rome and hope these suckers will be punished as though as possible.
It's possible to make enough money to be able to afford basic bills such as utilities and rent while working a full time, or multiple jobs, but not have enough left to pay for food. There's a system in place for assistance, actually, and that is called TANF: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. This system allots a certain amount of monetary assistance, per month, to be allocated to individuals or families that can only be used for food. Those are colloquially called "food stamps", as they used to be stamps printed by the government but have, more recently, been transferred to a card service. 
Fun fact- If you're too fucking poor, sometimes you're able to qualify for this based off your income level, also know as being "below the poverty line." 
TL; DR: Being poor is funny.
I will probably never be able to write fanfic because of how my brain works.  I will end up getting incredibly focused on one aspect of plot and ignore all the others for a chapter or 2.  Then from there I'll get into random tangents from that one plot aspect as I branch off with my thoughts.  Or even better, I'll simply just blow right past a major plot point I was intending to put in and not realize this mistake for about 2 chapters.  It sucks, but there's not much I can do.  That's why I try and devote my time to beta reading for people, since I'm pretty skilled with spelling/grammar/punctuation.
  [This is my normal thought process on a good day]( It sums up pretty well why I can't ever write a good story.
Well...
My writing techniques begin with everyone else's: the idea. I come up with an idea for the story and I bounce the idea around in my head like a basketball. From this point in time, this can go one of two ways. Either (A) we move on to the next part of the plan and get ready to write it out or (B) throw that idea in the trashcan where it belongs and *never speak of it again.*
I start the actual writing process somewhere between midnight and 4 am, because that is when your brain functions the best (ex. this post I am typing right now). I open up my Microsoft Word because I am too lazy to get Google Docs and Word came free with my laptop and I start a new document. After creating a new document, I will then stare at the blank document for a pathetically long period of time. After the stare down is over, I begin by walking away from the laptop and start watching Top Gear. After that episode's celebrity finishes their time lap in their reasonably priced car, I remembered I was going to write something and now back to the laptop. 
After repeating the staring part again, I crack my knuckles and actually use my fingers to press buttons. While I write the chapter I'm currently on, I am thinking about what is going to happen in future chapters because of course I am. Around this point, I would have about 500 words typed into the story. Once again, one of two things happen here. Either I get up and watch more Top Gear or halfway through typing something my laptop will crash, causing the story I had typed up so far to be lost, which in turn makes me cry.
Assuming I went down the Top Gear route, the second time I come back to the laptop is where the magic happens. At this point I will type up that chapter to completion. After the first illustration of the story is finished, it is time for editing. Or what I like to call it: The 3/5th Compromise for the 5 Stages of Grief. I call it this because when I read through my work, I usually end up feeling the 1st, 2nd, and 4th stage of Grief in that order.
After the editing comes to an end, I post it onto Fanfiction.net. Now, I know what you are thinking. 'Where do the beta readers come in?' Well, in my writing technique they don't because I was always too nervous to ask for one. I mean, look at all the great fanfics that wasn't beta read like Half-Life: Full Life Consequences, DOOM: Repercussions of Evil, and the ever popular My Immoral. And that is how I usually make my stories.
TL/DR version: I will be stealing ~~PartFootball's writing style~~ ~~someone else's writing style who posted it on here and don't feel like tagging right now~~ I actually am taking Part's style it seems because my old one was shite.
Edit: Don't think it needs to be said, but just in case this was written jokingly. This was how I wrote thing a few months ago but now I gotten into the habit of planning things out. Basically, this post was made in jest on how I used to do my writing.
Wow.
So, so untrue. Pitbulls are one of the most loving and kind dogs. The trouble with them is that IF they choose to do damage, they have the tools to cause a lot of harm.
If you want to talk about dogs that can be vicious, look up statistics instead of making a generalisation. A lot of smaller dogs have a much worse track record when it comes to attacking humans whereas these poor animals that get goaded into fighting are blamed when they turn. 
The only one  thing I would agree with you about is this; if someone tried to attack that girl, I would put good money on the fact that that  dog would rip the attacker apart. That dog would die before it let someone hurt its master. 
Pit bulls have the nickname "nanny dogs" because they used to be used in the Victorian times to look over children. They are fiercely protective of their wards. 
If your friend really has these dogs, he will verify.
 Pibbles are lovely. You're wrong.
Actually, a lot of doctors do the same thing when diagnosed. Cancer treatment is essentially pumping you full of poison that kills cancer faster, because it takes more resources faster than the rest of your cells. It is so unpleasant, many people would rather have 4 months in which you are relatively healthy and happy, vs 2 years of misery and pain. 
 cancer sucks gigantic balls. 
Last night I woke up and felt somebody lay down in my bed next to me. I don't have any pets and everyone else was asleep. I felt somebody lay down next to me and put a hand on me. I even managed to "grab" that hand, felt like a female hand and then I got paralyzed. I tried to ask who is this and turn my head around, but couldn't. Frightening, but I read about sleep paralysis before, so I knew what that was and just fell asleep again, woke up later, the succubus was already gone and I felt lonely again. I just wanted to share this.

 I slept with Holy Virgin Mary.
Proof of someone who has never played Minecraft. First things first, ignoring the "echo system" thing, yes, in order to build in Minecraft there is some level of environmental destruction required, but the beauty of Minecraft is that you can fix it. Chop down 20 trees to make room for your house? You can plant 50 more! Or not. It doesn't matter because Minecraft isn't real! And on the male protagonist part, a second protagonist was added, named Alex. Alex has a gender-neutral name for a reason. The original creator of Minecraft explicitly said that he does not want Minecraft to be a gendered game. Even Alex's appearance can be interpreted as either way. Before that, you could change your skin any time you wanted, for FREE! Be a man, be a woman, be a boy, be a girl, be a fucking penguin, nobody gives a shit! Also, wtf is with this "if you're a woman, you have to pay" bullshit? That makes no sense. Minecraft has to be payed for no matter who you are. 
 Retarded person is retarded. 
Why do people make texture packs like that? The default one is blocky because the world is built with blocks, if you want a game with graphics like that then why are you playing a game where the whole objective is to get blocks, build with blocks, and prosper with blocks?
TLDR - texture packs for minecraft are just stupid as hell
I'm going to advice against this. 

Not because of your astma, it's not my place to say what you can and can't do. The reason I think you shouldn't is because sooner or later you are likely to try nicotine liquids. Sure, vaping is a much safer alternative to smoking. But **nicotine is a drug, it is an addictive poison.** If you give it a fair chance, *you will realize how awesome it is, and you will become it's little bitch!* Nicotine really is an awesome drug! You might get a bit lightheaded, and a bit euphoric and calm, but at the same time you feel quite invigorated. 

Thing is, you will slowly, constantly have to increase the dosage to get this feeling (no smoker ever started at a pack a day). Sooner or later you will have to go without smoking and the withdrawal is not a pretty thing; first you get restless, fidgity and a little anxious, you can't concentrate because all you can think of is a cigg. This is usually where people go to get a puff. After about half a day you get frustrated, start having mood swings and get a little hungry for a substitute (usually fat or sugar). After a day you still have all of the above but start getting this dull, constant headache. Over the coming days/weeks you will get depressed, have sleeping problems, feel hungry yet gain weight. On the plus side my cravings *started* to die down after a month or so. Now (after half a year) I only have them every couple of days. Some ex addicts I have talked to says they never stop or that they are *mostly* gone after a couple of years.

Vaping is a big help for people to quit an addiction. If you or others were to acquire that addiction *because* of vapes, that's superb ammo for the vape opposition and can potentially make it much harder for people who are struggling to quit.

 Go ahead, vape to your hearts content. But don't do the nicotine.
Canadian student loan borrowers are off the hook if they move abroad. US citizens, depending on state they got the loan in are a much worse scenario. Many difference consequences can happen:
If they figure out where you live, they can and will sue and/or garnish your wages.
If they have no idea where you are, depending on state, they can issue a default judgement against you and even put a bench warrant for an arrest because the borrower was in contempt of court for not showing up. Again, I need to stress that only a few states in the US do this (for example Illinois). 
Canadians are pretty much off the hook. I have yet to hear a case where one moved abroad and got hammered for it, even in cases where there were actual bilateral treaties in place.
TL DR version: 
Canadian loan fugitive abroad: safe and sound
US loan fugitive: not so safe and sound
Cà a l'air très bien construit comme article mais... un TLDR pour les fainéants comme moi ?
With your strength levels and goals, 5/3/1 seems like a great choice. The best part of 5/3/1 (IMO) is that there is nothing except for The Big Four that is set in stone. BBB is too much or too little? Try some other "plug-in". Having a shitty day in the gym? Just do the main lift. Feel like doing bodyweight accessory work instead of DBs and BBs? No problem. Want to do conditioning? No problem either.
- 5/3/1
Pick a program and stick with it for ~2 months (including whatever deload scheme it uses). When you're done, ask yourself if you liked it, if you made progress, and if you still feel relatively healthy. You have to decide how you prioritize those 3 items.
If there were parts you liked and parts you didn't, try to identify a different program that emphasizes the parts you like. Do that for 8 weeks and then assess again.
One of the biggest parts of lifting as a lifelong hobby is figuring out what will make it a lifelong interest. "I want to get stronger" is a typical goal for a bunch of people, but there are a million ways to get there, and even if you use a "crappy" program that you really enjoy and get stronger with, then that's going to be better than some notionally optimal program you hate.
But if your primary goal is to compete in 6 months and that's truly what motivates you, look at weekly LPs for your strength level (e.g., Texas Method). On the other hand, if your primary goal is to compete because everyone says you should compete as quickly as possible, then is that really what motivates you, or are you just listening to what everyone who's been competing for years says is their motivation?
 The best program is one that you stick with, which you seem to know. But it's nearly impossible for someone else to tell you what you're most likely to stick with, and part of an intermediate lifter's challenge is figuring out what actually motivates them.
Thank you for the reply.  I personally know quite a few women who regretted it, and others who opted out completely for reasons similar to my own concerns.  I have a lot of respect for them and their SOs for being able to reach some form of compromise that all sides were comfortable with.
I have thought long and hard about it and I've decided that I'd rather keep my SO than my name.  We've decided that it will become my middle name and I will keep using it as a pen name.  It's really the only thing that he has "put his foot down" about, so to speak, because it's not only important to him, but to his entire family.  He's an amazing man and he would not be the same person without his heritage/cultural background.  I'm willing to give up my name for him, no matter how much I dislike the idea, because the relationship we're building is more important than the emotional attachment I have to a collection of syllables associated with me.
There are two people in this relationship and sometimes we have to compromise.
I believe you have to use your most recent tax return each year, so you would be "hypothetically" committing fraud (someone correct me if I am wrong on this). 
 Don't do it yo.
Mine was when I was at university. My rugby team had a court session after the game one saturday. For those of you unfamiliar with the drinking culture around rugby teams, particularly student rugby teams, a court session is where every member of the team is tried in front of a "judge" by a "sheriff" this is accompanied by much drinking  laughter, drinking,  merriment, drinking, occasional vomiting  &amp;  more drinking. Some of the charges one faces can be rugby related (getting sent off for example) or completely made up (I was once put on trial for stealing a fullbacks car - he never had a car.) 
With the scene set, I'll paint you a picture, The court session began &amp; ended in an alcoholic haze, Id been charged 3 times, but had been determined not to vomit during the court session, a badge of honor I had successfully earned. First Mistake. 
My second mistake was heading into town with the small group of lads that had remained vertical and relatively coherent following the  battle. 
Mistake number 3 was meeting a bunch of friends that included a mates friend, who I had a pretty bad crush on. In my drunken state I must have been significantly more charming than usual, as after a few more drinks she was more than happy to head back to my place. 
Did I say Id had a few more drinks... 
We got home, and got down to business. Have you ever tried to do any vigorous physical activity after drinking to the point where you feel like throwing up? 
In teh throws of passion, I threw up. all over her, ALL over her. Do you know what happens if someone throws up on you? She threw up. It was like something from the omen. except with more screaming and me yelling "im sorry im sorry!"
Cleaning up and waiting for her taxi was the most awkward 20-30 minutes of my life.
Surprisingly  there was no second chance, and within 48 hours all our friends knew exactly what had happened. 
 I got wasted drunk at rugby, pulled a girl I had a crush on, threw up all over her, she threw up in my bed, barely spoke to me again and told my entire friend group the story. 
Instant Action to Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown. Re-spawn at Crown. Die at Crown...etc

my first fps game, i went 15-150 in my first session. At Crown.
Gonna get on a bus soon that will take me to a bigass ship that will take me back to finland. 
Tldr on sweden trip to relatives: Everyone give the baby to tripping.
/u/tweetypi is right.  You need a plan of your own in place.  I can tell you from very difficult experiences, you should never, EVER, move to another city unless you have a plan in place in which you will be perfectly fine and not out on your ass if the relationship goes sideways.  What you SHOULD be doing, is just moving to her city INTO *YOUR OWN* PLACE.  
I've done LDRs in the past.  Learned a few things.  People project romanticized versions of themselves when they can control others perceptions of them across great distances.  People are a hell of a lot harder to get along with in person than over electronic mediums.  People create romanticized versions of their LDR SO's in their heads due to lack of actual face to face contact.  Moving in with someone you haven't spent much time around quickly reveals EVERYTHING about them that would irritate the ever living shit out of you.  People get comfortable in the quiet solitude of LDR's over time, and moving in together so quickly disrupts that to a pretty large degree.
I could go on.  
 She is right to be weary, and so should you.
Here's a good little explanation pulled from [here](
&gt;Backpressure: The myth and why it's wrong. 
&gt;I. Introduction
One of the most misunderstood concepts in exhaust theory is backpressure. People love to talk about backpressure on message boards with no real understanding of what it is and what it's consequences are. I'm sure many of you have heard or read the phrase "Engines need backpressure" when discussing exhaust upgrades. That phrase is in fact completely inaccurate and a wholly misguided notion. 
&gt;II. Some basic exhaust theory
Your exhaust system is designed to evacuate gases from the combustion chamber quickly and efficently. Exhaust gases are not produced in a smooth stream; exhaust gases originate in pulses. A 4 cylinder motor will have 4 distinct pulses per complete engine cycle, a 6 cylinder has 6 pules and so on. The more pulses that are produced, the more continuous the exhaust flow. Backpressure can be loosely defined as the resistance to positive flow - in this case, the resistance to positive flow of the exhaust stream. 
&gt;III. Backpressure and velocity
Some people operate under the misguided notion that wider pipes are more effective at clearing the combustion chamber than narrower pipes. It's not hard to see how this misconception is appealing - wider pipes have the capability to flow more than narrower pipes. So if they have the ability to flow more, why isn't "wider is better" a good rule of thumb for exhaust upgrading? In a word - VELOCITY. I'm sure that all of you have at one time used a garden hose w/o a spray nozzle on it. If you let the water just run unrestricted out of the house it flows at a rather slow rate. However, if you take your finger and cover part of the opening, the water will flow out at a much much faster rate. 
&gt;The astute exhaust designer knows that you must balance flow capacity with velocity. You want the exhaust gases to exit the chamber and speed along at the highest velocity possible - you want a FAST exhaust stream. If you have two exhaust pulses of equal volume, one in a 2" pipe and one in a 3" pipe, the pulse in the 2" pipe will be traveling considerably FASTER than the pulse in the 3" pipe. While it is true that the narrower the pipe, the higher the velocity of the exiting gases, you want make sure the pipe is wide enough so that there is as little backpressure as possible while maintaining suitable exhaust gas velocity. Backpressure in it's most extreme form can lead to reversion of the exhaust stream - that is to say the exhaust flows backwards, which is not good. The trick is to have a pipe that that is as narrow as possible while having as close to zero backpressure as possible at the RPM range you want your power band to be located at. Exhaust pipe diameters are best suited to a particular RPM range. A smaller pipe diameter will produce higher exhaust velocities at a lower RPM but create unacceptably high amounts of backpressure at high rpm. Thus if your powerband is located 2-3000 RPM you'd want a narrower pipe than if your powerband is located at 8-9000RPM. 
&gt;Many engineers try to work around the RPM specific nature of pipe diameters by using setups that are capable of creating a similar effect as a change in pipe diameter on the fly. The most advanced is Ferrari's which consists of two exhaust paths after the header - at low RPM only one path is open to maintain exhaust velocity, but as RPM climbs and exhaust volume increases, the second path is opened to curb backpressure - since there is greater exhaust volume there is no loss in flow velocity. BMW and Nissan use a simpler and less effective method - there is a single exhaust path to the muffler; the muffler has two paths; one path is closed at low RPM but both are open at high RPM. 
&gt;IV. So how did this myth come to be?
I often wonder how the myth "Engines need backpressure" came to be. Mostly I believe it is a misunderstanding of what is going on with the exhaust stream as pipe diameters change. For instance, someone with a civic decides he's going to uprade his exhaust with a 3" diameter piping. Once it's installed the owner notices that he seems to have lost a good bit of power throughout the powerband. He makes the connections in the following manner: "My wider exhaust eliminated all backpressure but I lost power, therefore the motor must need some backpressure in order to make power." What he did not realize is that he killed off all his flow velocity by using such a ridiculously wide pipe. It would have been possible for him to achieve close to zero backpressure with a much narrower pipe - in that way he would not have lost all his flow velocity. 
&gt;V. So why is exhaust velocity so important?
The faster an exhaust pulse moves, the better it can scavenge out all of the spent gasses during valve overlap. The guiding principles of exhaust pulse scavenging are a bit beyond the scope of this doc but the general idea is a fast moving pulse creates a low pressure area behind it. This low pressure area acts as a vacuum and draws along the air behind it. A similar example would be a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed on a dusty road. There is a low pressure area immediately behind the moving vehicle - dust particles get sucked into this low pressure area causing it to collect on the back of the vehicle. This effect is most noticeable on vans and hatchbacks which tend to create large trailing low pressure areas - giving rise to the numerous "wash me please" messages written in the thickly collected dust on the rear door(s).
  Best exhaust is lowest backpressure while maintaining highest exhaust velocity.
I have such a difficult time listening to people bagging on the historicity of the BoM. We can barely get our own history accurate from a couple hundred years ago. We look at history through a lens of modern times and culture by what was preserved historically, and it relies on so much speculation - even many of the New Testament places are in question because of the lack of preservation and records of those places. Jump into the Americas 2000 years ago and the grey area becomes nearly black. Shoot - turn on the news and tell me how accurate any of that is - and it's stuff happening now. We have faith in the historians, we have faith in the news - what about faith in God?
DNA evidence you say? There's also a ton of faith in science that leans on this. Science is about as fickle as a kid in a toy store. Todays "knowledge" is tomorrows "Ok, we know more now, so that wasn't really accurate" ( [Big Bang, anyone?]( ). Not to mention we have to really believe that most of the population of the Americas were primarily descendants of Lehi, which we don't believe (even in the BoM Church's heyday, about 3,000 people joined the Church that year - we aren't talking mass quantities of people here). If I put on my tin foil hat, I could go down a rabbit hole of conspiracies out there that suggest that the true history of the Americas is actively hushed ( [Mound builders?]( A can of worms for a different time, I suppose). But unless we are doing the research for ourselves, we have actively put our faith in the historians and the scientists here, no room for error. I'll just put my faith where I strongly believe I already received a witness of the validity of the Book of Mormon, and that faith is in God.
 The article has a good point. 
First and foremost, that is a video of OP's max, and EVERY max will have some form degradation. If you have perfect form, you're not maxing out deadlift. 
OP's lower back is rounding, that's bad, at 0:34 you can see his hips dip down and back a little bit, common error for conventional deadlift where most people struggle towards the top. If he's maxing out he should invest in a proper lifting belt and learn how to flex the abdominal wall outwards, that always helped me maintain a straight lower back.
One thing to remember though is rounding your upper back is [perfectly fine if you know what you're doing]( Many strong mother fuckers do it. That doesn't mean if your form is turning to shit at higher loads that your upper back rounding is necessarily a good thing, it means that keeping an entirely straight back isn't the "only correct" form.
deadlifts are tough. Also the sky is blue. 
Although frequency graphs aren't everything, it's important to be able to interpret what a headphone's sound signature might be like by looking at an objective graph. 
I'm saying it's a very large investment for headphones when you don't know what they will sound like because you can't read a frequency graph. 
For example, I find that I enjoy a flatter, neutral sound. Wow, the LCD2's graph shows a neutral sound, plus that might be a good choice because I've also heard good things about their clarity, sound stage, etc. 
how do you know what "good sound" you want if you don't know what makes a certain headphone/sound signature sound good to you. 
Groups are a fairly general mathematical object; a group is a set of elements that obey certain algebraic properties and can be manipulated and studied algebraically, like a number system.
For example: the states of a rubik's cube form a group. One state might be a solved cube except you've rotated the red face by 90 degrees CW, and another state might instead have the blue face rotated 90 degrees CW. You can "add" these states together and get a cube where the red face and then the blue face were rotated by 90 degrees.
Simple groups are fundamental; any finite group can be described in terms of simple groups. Simple groups are like atoms, where groups in general are like molecules. 
The article describes the classification of all simple groups, which is important because it describes every possible fundamental group in group theory.
However, there are still so many of these it took a really long time to classify all of them, and it took so much work that no single living person really understands the whole proof.
I think.
a really important theorem describing abstract algebra took so much work no one individual understands the whole thing.
Haven't seen the movie but it sounds like pretty typical Hollywood romance silliness.
Girl is "super hot" but also quirky and normal in a way the audience relates to so they can imagine themselves in her shoes.
Girl meets super hot mega alpha but he is distant.
Girl magically changes superman into play doh and has absolute power over him.
Insert one of a few endings
A they marry forever
B she finds someone better

nothing new here, this plays out in every romance movie Hollywood makes.
A scolex is referred to as a "head" it's the point of attachment for a flat worm , your professor was probably trying to emphasize that is not a head in the traditional since , I.e doesn't have eyes brain , etc. but when talking worm anatomy it's the head of the worm hope that makes sense. As for proglottids unless the classification has changed since I took invertebrate zoology they are considered segments of the worm. Without context it's hard for me to say what your professor was emphasizing by stating they aren't segments. This isn't my primary field I studied cell development and function and now work in pharmaceuticals so I might be rusty. TLDR they are specific terms for flat worm anatomy 
Our genetic codes are almost identical. We have the same overall structure - we have the same number of chromosomes as everyone else (with some cool exceptions), and on those chromosomes, the genes are in the same place in the same number.
Differences: 
There are small differences between our gene copies that affect the proteins they encode.
There are small differences in the way our genes are expressed from genetic changes in regions of DNA that regulate protein expression.
There may be changes that affect RNA-splicing - a step before mRNA translation that affects the resulting protein.
Telomere length - as you get older, your telomeres shrink. This leads to some differences in how old you seem.
- It's not that we have different combinations, it's usually that there are small changes that are (usually) barely consequential.
&gt; Unsatisfying and contradictory findings from glucose studies underscore that energy consumption in the brain is not a simple matter of greater mental effort sapping more of the body's available energy. Claude Messier of the University of Ottawa has reviewed many such studies. He remains unconvinced that any one cognitive task measurably changes glucose levels in the brain or blood. "In theory, yes, a more difficult mental task requires more energy because there is more neural activity," he says, "but when people do one mental task you won't see a large increase of glucose consumption as a significant percentage of the overall rate. The base level is quite a lot of energy—even in slow-wave sleep with very little activity there is still a high baseline consumption of glucose." Most organs do not require so much energy for basic housekeeping. But the brain must actively maintain appropriate concentrations of charged particles across the membranes of billions of neurons, even when those cells are not firing. Because of this expensive and continuous maintenance, the brain usually has the energy it needs for a little extra work.
Source: The great Claude Messier, quoted [here](
TL:DR: Well, it seems like it almost certainly does, theoretically, but practically, it likely does not seem to make a ton of different above the brain's already impressive baseline metabolic cost
Lets start with your specific example of an improv festival. If you're paying a headliner to perform at your show, then you could include non-compete stipulations in the contract. Here's an example: a large non-improv theater brings in a well known touring improv group, and the contract they have with that group stipulates that they can't do other shows in the area during their run, and the troupe also agrees to not do any marketing during that time for other shows in the area (which effectively rules out them performing elsewhere in the city a week or two later). If you're working to draft up a contract for this, talk to a large (likely non-improv) theater, and they can probably help you out with the boilerplate language they use. But I'd argue you shouldn't stress about it, and here's why...
My experience has been that within the improv community, the non-compete thing is often handled informally. Headliners know that it is incredibly bad form to travel on a festival's dime and then put on shows or workshops during or very close to that festival. And it's not like there's a huge world of festival organizers... if someone pulls this, we all find out. 
And there's a lot of other ways this informally gets discussed and hashed out. For example, I know a festival with limited money for bringing in headliners that helps offset the lower pay by not only allowing the headliner to do private coaching for troupes during and after the festival, and even helps connect those troupes to the headliner. 
It's worth mentioning that these informal norms go beyond paid troupes as well. Last year I heard from another festival organizer about a non-headliner (unpaid) NYC duo who performed in a festival and then offered a non-festival workshop during the fest and running directly against festival workshops. The festival couldn't and didn't do anything about it, but they're never getting into that festival again. And I suspect every other organizer who heard the story is likely to think twice about inviting them to perform. 
You can do it, you probably don't have to (but do make sure you're at least informally on the same page), and if things go south odds are you wouldn't want to sink the time and money into enforcing it. 
I have worked towards a more simple magical system. 
_______________
**What It Is**  

Magic is something that resonates deep within the core of the planet. Deep within the churning mire of the center, compounds of McGuffinite are being smashed together and creating the process by which magic is able to be used.
_______________
**Why It Works**  

The biology of lifeforms on our planet is such that every creature big and small has McGuffinite in their very being. (Think of it as an element present in our very own bodies, much like the chemical composition we exhibit (hydrogen, carbon, aluminum, mercury). It's just there as another element in existence.
However, the difference being the percentage. In most life forms, the presence of this McGuffinite is trace only, being at-best, an irrelevant makeup in their otherwise normal lives. 
Some organisms, though, would have considerably **more** McGuffinite in their body, allowing them to do some amazing things.
As is natural, there would be variations in an individual as there would be in a group. Some species might be more inclined to have a higher concentration than another and still produce an individual that has very little (or none at all). Likewise is the inverse, where a species with a low or average amount of McGuffinite might birth one that has a great saturation.
In any of these cases, the effects would be considered relatively normal. Perhaps they have strange, predictive dreams, or find that they always know where to find water regardless of their location. 
What we know as "mages" or "wizards" or "sorcerers" (any term, even invented ones) would be those individuals with an unnaturally high yield of McGuffinite in their bodies. They might be able to craft a fire from almost nothing, or tame the wildest of the wild beast, or ride a thermal of wind through a canyon.
 *Some might even be able to topple towers and summon massive golems out of the living earth.*
**These individuals would be rare**, wielding power beyond that of their peers. I imagine a very small percentage of any particular species' population would rank at this level of raw aptitude, and even then would require many years of practice to gain a true mastery.  
____________________
**What The Process Is Behind It**
For a mage or other strong magic user, the process of activating their talents would be a simple matter of drawing on the power of the McGuffinite from the core of the planet. One would be required to concentrate so that they might **tune** themselves to the frequency of the McGuffinite. Then they could utilize their traits and take advantage of the gifts of their home.  
Intent is necessary. The user has to "feel" the presence of the McGuffinite in the planet, and the world around them and feel it also in their bodies. They would then draw upon the power produced with an intention in their minds.
Less experienced magicians might require using a gesture of some sort, much like "training wheels" on a bicycle. It would, with practice, become less necessary to make these motions with time, though every user's style would be different, with varying levels of competency for all.
____________________
**Who Else Does It Work For?**  

In addition to those with the natural gifts, later cultures would develop a way of "cheating", granting magical ability to those who had the wealth or cutthroat nature to achieve their ends.
This could result in people brewing drafts of potions, crafted from refined McGuffinite and designed to give one a temporary experience of magical ability (of varying strength).
Others would develop **WANDS** made of actual McGuffinite, hard to come by and even harder to use. These instruments would be used to pierce the flesh of it's user, allowing them to "jack in" to the flow of McGuffinite, almost like an antennae. 
Future and more advanced cultures would develop implants and supplements designed around activating the molecular resonance of McGuffinite
______
**How Does This Negatively Effect the User?**
The negative effects associated with heavy or even casual use of magic would vary, though, in general, extreme fatigue would be the most common immediate side effect.    
Long term effects would be deadening of tissue, weakening of bones and teeth, hair loss, muscle atrophy, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and in many cases: **DEEEEEEEEATH**.  
Most dangerous of all is the **addiction**. Magical dependency would be rampant among wizards and their ilk. Some might become so dependent that they "overdose" feeding themselves into the pure flow of magic so much so that they expire attempting to control it.
Magic is an intensely pleasurable experience, which is a major contributing reason to why some are willing to disfigure their bodies in the pursuit of this power. It is a dangerous creature to attempt to control.
Additionally, the magic would, over time, begin to create a sort of "magical muscle memory" in the user, causing them to be able to perform feats that were familiar as almost a second nature. This is less of a negative and more of a general explanation.
______________________

**Magic is caused by McGuffinite element in the core of the earth and all the living things. Species use this to "tune" into it and use magic to different effects. Some people cheat and disfigure themselves. It's like a drug and people get addicted to it and some die. Basically it's like an addictive form of powerful cancer.**
[My current Submission](  
I am currently thinking about kicking the "Needed experience" out and changing the formula around, so a precise "spell" simply needs more energy.  
Also an interesting thought at the moment is, using this to relay information back to you.  
A use of this could be to submit an object to its natural frequency and potentially causing a resonance disaster.  
Or you could just drain small energy at a low rate  from the neighboring room, when suddenly the rate rises (your M-nite heats up) something with more energy has entered the room. Probably a human.  
Also, disregard the numbers in the graphic, to much WIP.
  
Hopefully I will have more time to think about this in detail, when I am done with exams.
  
****  
- there is a fictional particle, with some fictional properties  
- from this point out everything adheres to our laws of physics + the fictional particle properties  
- works through energy transfer  
- formulas are just supposed to give a ballpark idea of the involved difficulty/energy of a spell
After solo supporting a few games, I had a pretty hard game on earthshaker, where I never afforded blink until the end of the game (around 40 mins in) due to needing wards and detection. It was the kinda game where even though we won, I still didnt enjoy the game, and it was nice to feel appreciated. Just wanted to share.
 Thank your support if they did well and did it solo, it means a lot more than you think it does
No.  
Just over 1200 upvotes disbursed over 6 posts is still about than one third of some soma-like celebrity "news".  
If your argument is that none of the individual posts achieved such a high upvote count because there were multiple similar stories, I would argue that this should actually cause an increase in the cumulative sum of upvotes because people have more opportunities to upvote.  Furthermore, those who are passionate about basic human rights will be upvoting all of the articles -- which would lead to an even larger increase.   
  
** I didn't ignore the other posts.**
SO MUCH THIS, I work in a hospital and yeah it sucks for the nurses... But they also get time and a half for the pay... my gf got 62 an hr for her last over night snow shift... Now the other staff: patient care, facilities and such, got time and a half but a lot were forced to leave early and take an extra day off to alleviate the costs...plus they make about 22 an hr during that time. 
Feel bad for the support staff, nurses RAKE it in on times like these... The shifts that go up for grabs during this are gone in minutes
No. Devices set how much current they can draw, not the charger. Too much voltage on the other hand can kill things, but that's not a modern problem with almost everything on the USB standard. 
you're safe. It won't draw more current than it can use. It may not take advantage of the higher current available, but it won't hurt it. 
Rest vs Spiral is amazing. 
I play Spiral, and I remember playing a few months ago against a guy running High Tide as well. I thought to myself "oh fun! This should be interesting." And proceeded to sculpt my combo in my hand. Turn 4 comes around, he taps down to 1 land and passes. 
So I draw my Time Spiral and decide 'why not?' 
I'll tell you why. 
I combo off for a solid 20 minutes, get my Tide count up to 11, and eventually decide to end it and wish for BSZ. What's he gunna do? Counter me out? I had a counterspell of my own to protect my kill. He taps his land (for 11. Remember High Tide effects all islands.) and plays Reset. 
Shiiiiiiiiiit. 
He untaps his 4 Islands with Reset and now it was his turn. To make a long story short: he won by eventually getting the Tide count to 17. He casted and flashed back all 4 High Tides except 2, and eventually drove me into the ground. We were both giggling like children by the time it was all said and done. I was never so happy to have my face beaten into the ground, than have it done by the step brother of my own deck. 
High Tide mirror match isn't ALWAYS a mirror match. 
I seriously don't know how i would handle being in the same room as anything that looked like this- whenever i see people with bloated lips and no philtrum i get nauseous. I did see cat lady wildenstein from a car in manhattan years ago- i absolutely could not like, say, stand in line behind her or eat in the same restaurant. I generally give zero fucks what anyone else is doing, but that plastic look scares the bejesus out of me. I could totally see myself burning these bitches with fire or stomping them out. Lol
TL:dr. Fucking gross
Ici c'est la traducion francais, merci!:
J'en aurais long à dire sur la nouvelle loi que les conservateurs d'Harper essaient de passer, mais je crois que la majorité d'entre nous a une bonne idée de pourquoi on ne devrait pas laisser passer cette loi. Personnellement, je suis tanné de voir, à travers l'écran de mon ordinateur, tous ces compatriotes Canadiens émettre leurs préoccupations sur Internet (et particulièrement sur reddit) sans qu'ils n'aient aucune autre façon de présenter leur opinion que d'écrire à leur député et de se plaindre les uns aux autres sur des plateformes virtuelles.
C'est pour ça, Canada, que je vous demande de m'accompagner dans ma mission qui servira à attirer l'attention générale sur cette atteinte inutile à nos droits et d'organiser des manifestations IMPORTANTES dans toutes les métropoles de notre beau pays. Je suis loin d'être un expert et je fais rarement ce que je suis en train de faire, mais je suis un Canadien fier qui ne supporterait pas de voir passer cette loi ridicule.
Je cherche donc des personnes qui, pour chaque grande ville, serviraient de représentant pour prendre la responsabilité d'organiser des manifestations PACIFIQUES et RESPECTUEUSES. Du moment où nous aurons trouvé tous les représentants, nous pourrons planifier la date et l'heure durant laquelle toutes ces manifestations se tiendront, en même temps, partout au Canada. Et je parle de grandes manifestations. Pas d'histoires de 10 ou 20 personnes. Nous devrons aussi nous assurer que les médias seront informés, au moment où tout sera fin prêt et en branle. Mais j'ai besoin de votre aide pour tout ça.
Quand nous aurons trouvé tous les représentants:
Si je ne m'abuse, il y a certaines lois limitant les manifestations pacifiques, que ce soit par rapport au nombre de participants ou encore au moment où elles se tiendront. Ceci dépend probablement de votre ville et de ses lois. Nous aurons donc besoin de détails à ce niveau, que vous obtiendrez en demandant aux responsables de votre ville.
Nous procéderons à la création d'un subreddit si ce post atteint une notoriété assez importante. Il contiendra les informations importantes et sera tenu à jour. Nous devrons aussi faire la promotion de cette campagne dans les divers subreddits des provinces et des métropoles.
Toutefois, ce qui est primordial est de trouver des membres de la communauté Reddit qui connaissent bien ce projet de loi et qui seraient intéressés à écrire, de façon professionnelle et bien pensée, une liste des raisons qui expliquent notre rejet de la loi, tout en demeurant simple et accessible à tous. Je vous supplie donc, /r/Canada, de joindre mes efforts et m'aider à organiser tout ceci. Je suis prêt à prendre le poste de représentant pour la ville de Vancouver. Je ne peux tout simplement pas me permettre de regarder cette loi passer sans rien faire.
 Cette loi, c'est de la grosse marde fak lève ton cul, dépose ta bière, retrousse tes manches, pis au travail.
Edit 1: Si vous n'avez pas encore écrit à votre député à propos de la loi C-51, FAITES-LE. Si vous n'avez aucune idée comment monter une lettre professionnelle qui fait le tour du sujet, utilisez la search bar et vous trouverez des posts où certaines personnes ont laissé des canevas où vous n'aurez qu'à remplir quelques champs et envoyer votre lettre. Aussi, si vous êtes de Calgary et voulez participer, contacter /u/AlphaNerd80 par MP et demandez lui comment vous rendre utile.
Pour plus d'information allez au /r/protestcanada, c'est en anglais alors vous pouvez utiliser un traduiter ou demandez moi sur DM et je peut vous aider.
A lot of people seem to be under the impression that career mode is supposed to be the "ultimate" way to play the game.
It's not supposed to be better. It's supposed to be different.
To me, career is where I get to struggle with the challenge of building the expensive orbital infrastructure and fanciful "cool" missions that *I* would like, while balancing it with a budget set by outside forces with entirely different ideas and agendas. Much like how every space agency have to limit their awesome projects by what other people are willing to pay for.
This is not everyone's cup of tea, and that's perfectly fine. This is exactly why sandbox and science mode exists. There are plenty of ways in this game in which one can find challenge and enjoyment. For some, just getting into orbit is more than enough challenge, and for them to struggle with funds is just abuse. For those like me who do orbital assembly of multi-destination interplanetary missions while half asleep and eyeball our maneuvers without bothering with the nodes, mere exploration doesn't cut it any longer. This is where mods, career and/or self-imposed restrictions come into play.
That said, career does need a lot of rebalancing, which Squad readily admits to, and is working on for 1.0.
**** Don't think of any of the three modes in terms of "better". Find the mode that fits your style and expectations, and enjoy yourself.
Sort of.
Our drummer named it. His mate used to be in a band called Static (which I hate as a name but whatever), and he thought adding X to that would be good (also a 'cooler' way of spelling ecstatic). And then when he was close to joining us, he would have been an eX
 member of Static, so that'd be clever.
Then one day I was listening to a Foo album and I noticed it was called 'X.Static' and I thought 'fuck you mate, you've been rumbled'. He reckons he was 'subconsciously thinking of it at the time'. But I don't mind, cos it's solid (for now...)

Worked in a call center for Cox Communications, can confirm. You get to talking to a large number of people and over a year or two you get a very good feeling what is on the minds of your customers, the patterns start forming in the clouds. "If there was another provider in my area..." "The bill just seems to keep going up and up every year.." "...You guys have great support but I can't afford your pricing.."
Bottom line, the cable industry is there to make money, IMO every move they make is a calculated risk. The company will lose this many customers if they increase the price by this much. Where they make a profit is on the new customers they bring on, current customers who've been loyal for years, and those who don't care enough to do anything about it. Oh, you're one of those customers that wants to do something about it? That sucks.  Best they'll give you is a discount on your bill for 6 months to 1 year, then BAM going right back to where it started, plus a little extra. You've gotta remember those yearly price increases. 
They currently contract out a good amount of the work and this is the new fad, increase how many contractors you use vs the amount of real employees to whom you have to pay benefits, raises, and supervisors to manage those real employees. Contractors sometimes do worse work but you don't have to pay them as much or manage them as closely.
The really big and important thing coming is something they already know about..The "End of Cable" as we know it. It's already happening, they are already losing thousands of customers because of this..but they're ahead of the curve in a way, they're thinking in the future. They've steadily built up their HSI infrastructure, monopolized small and large businesses in the area. Currently they are working on something called Gigablast (I know, what a stupid name), basically gigabit for residential HSI customers. They already have gigabit for business. On top of all of that, they re-structured they're business model to a COE. Closed around 10 - 12 call centers throughout the country, restructured upper management, and are implementing new business ideas for increasing revenue and customer base. 
The best advice I can give to my reddit buddies is to drop your cable service, it is a waste of time, effort, and money. To put this into perspective how much I used cable, I paid 15$ for my cable service. Which included all CH's, HBO, Cinemax, Movie Ch's, Starz, Showtime. Basically everything except the playboy channel and a couple other pay as you go content. I took it back because I couldn't justify spending 15$ on something I didn't use. Netflix or Amazon Prime are great legal ways to get your video content.
Get an internet speed of 5 - 60 MBPS, don't rent your equipment - unless you can't transfer equipment to another provider, you will only be using it for less than a year, and/or you don't have the money. Don't get phone unless you absolutely need it, and no, faxing is not something you need! IMO. 
If you're moving, don't transfer services, cancel them, call sales get a temporary discount for new installation for 6 months - 1 year, ask for the install fees to be credited back if possible. I say this because many places don't have discounts for legacy customers, if you transfer services your bill will most likely be the same if not more with "small" install fees. At least with cancelling and signing back up like a new customer you can ride the discount train for awhile.
If you know you will not be cancelling services or moving for 1-2 years, a price lock guarantee can actually save you money. Cox doesn't require you to sign a price lock unless you want to or for certain discount packages. 
Call in a couple times every year, mark it on your calendar. 
Best times of the year to call - 1-2 months before school starts, 2-3 months after school starts, mondays - thursdays &amp; sundays, depends on if there is a fight on Saturdays you won't have as high of call volumes. 
They will put up automated messages if there is an outage in your area. If you're power just got restored from a downed pole, you're going to be waiting awhile. 
When you do call in, ask what the acceptable levels are for TX and RX signals (this can change depending on provider, cox runs coaxial cable to your house) then ask if your signals are at those recommended levels. If you have intermittent HSI connection ask them to check if you have packet loss, if they don't know what that is or they don't know how to test it. Ask them to call help desk to find out. 
Don't yell at the Tier 1 guy or for that matter, their supervisor. If you have to, hang up, call back, you might have to wait awhile longer but you'll get someone else. Normally you'll run into the problem of someone just not caring or they just don't want to help you because they're burnt out on their job. Some people enjoy their jobs but at a call center, its different. I personally had a love/hate relationship with it, I loved the challenge but hated the negativity, you get drowned in it. You can have the coolest and most positive personality but at the end of the day even if you don't get yelled at and you're mentally exhausted. If you want to know what I mean, work in a call center for 3 - 6 months. If you are brave 1 - 2 years, that's as much as I could handle at least (found another job which I've been wanting for years!) 
I'm sure I could keep going on and on but that covers the major points I wanted to. As a side note, we should all band together and build municipal broadband fiber. 
Thanks for reading through this wall of text. Hope this cuts down on the frustration and creates more understanding for you guys/gals.
For you lazies out there -

Worked for a bunch of Cox, they always want more money. Advice for having a better experience with your current provider and treating call center folk with more respect. Final thoughts: Build Municipal Broadband Fiber, I'll help!
Dude thanks for bringing this up I forgotten how peculiar my first time smoking pot was.
So around 2 1/2 years ago I was in high school in a semi-urban area. I had no experience with recreational drugs whatsoever so I was brand spankin' new to the world of drugs. I was with my SO and we had just gotten out of school and decided to hit up one of our druggie friends for a dimebag. I even remember the fuckin' dimebag - it had penguins on it with some dank ass weed in it. There were only two problems: how the fuck do we smoke this shit and where do we smoke it at? Believe it or not this was actually difficult to figure out as we weren't able to buy pipes/even had the money to and we were smack dab in the middle of a city so there wasn't much options as a place to go to smoke this dank bud.
So we're brainstorming n shit and I finally figure out a place to smoke! There's this bridge near a mall that druggies normally go under to do you-guessed-it. That solves one problem... but still how are you gonna smoke this? We look up a bunch of ways to smoke bud without a pipe leading us to two ways... apple or a can of soda. Neither are really smart but goddamn I was ignorant back then.  So that settles it. Normally on some days we have after school programs like orchestra (I went to an arts school) or some shit but on one particular day we skip the after school classes and head straight for the bridge. We buy a can of arizona, make our way to under the bridge, and find a nice spot where we won't be disturbed.
I take out the can and start figuring out how to cut it up to smoke it. After fumbling with the thing I practically give up, it's just too damn complicated (it really isn't) for my puny teenage brain. So we get ready to pack it up and leave when out of fucking nowhere this druggie kid from our school strolls out of no where from the woods (keep in mind there's the roads that lead to the bridge and then the forest area on the opposite side). So this dude walks up to us from *out of no where* by himself looking all suspect and he's like 'oh shit you guys are smoking weed out of this can? lemme show you how it's done.' He takes the can and starts putting dents and holes in so we can smoke this bud (Please for the love of god don't do this). There's more to this story that makes it odd for a first time but I can't say without revealing his personal info.
So basically a wild druggie appears from the forest all pokemon style and helps my SO and I smoke weed for the first time. My oh my something about this weed's taste and smell stuck with me for so long after that. I remember the taste perfectly to this day. After that we head to a hilled area and just laid in the grass. That was one of the most peaceful days of my life.
 my SO and I couldn't figure out for the life of us how to smoke weed when a wild druggie appears from the most secluded place to show us. Good times.
Edit: damn I didn't realize how long my story was. it's really not that interesting lol. sorry I was reliving that moment while typing and got carried away.
For spring break of my senior year, a group of my friends and I rented a beach house in Florida all to ourselves. I had long been curious about weed, but was too much of a goody two-shoes to have tried it before then. I decided spring break would be the ideal time and recruited the help of my friend group's resident stoner.
He prepared his medium to large bong for me, and I held nothing back. After coughing my lungs out for a solid two minutes, I slowly noticed a change in my perception. I actually had light tracers and felt quite different but great at the same time. I knew that munchies were a "thing", so I procured some Chewy granola bars. Sitting down with closed eyes, I focused all of my attention on what I was tasting. The entire experience was amazing. I saw explosions of color which corresponded to my sensation of taste, almost exactly like [this scene]( in the movie Ratatouille. There was one particular explosion of flavor which erupted from the back of my tongue and created quite the lightshow. It was so intense that I couldn't help but proclaim, "I JUST HAD AN ORGASM IN MY MOUTH!" My friend even took a picture to commemorate the moment.
I also recall laughing my ass off at my friend who had also tried smoking for the first time. He was either feeling a completely different high or was trying to appear so, and high-me believed the latter. He was just sitting there eating with a sort of blank, confused look on his face. I was feeling amazing, and I couldn't reconcile the difference between both of us, so "he must have been faking it." Another friend also convinced me to eat some cosmopolitan-flavored shisha by telling me, "It only tastes good when you're high." Smelled delicious, but tasted like chemicals. It was quite the night.
Ripped a bong for the first time, had light tracers and an "orgasm in my mouth", laughed my ass off at my "fake friend", and was convinced to eat shisha.
edit: [Here is said commemorative picture.]( Notice the Chewy bars.
I met my gf, and we had been casually dating (and fucking) for about 2 weeks. We made it official the day before I smoked weed the first time. 
So anyway, senior year of high school, and it's April 20, and coincidentally my school's prom night. I'm curious and my new gf has access to weed but hadn't smoked in a year or so, plus it's 4/20 and we wanna celebrate  getting together. So we get a 20 sac, a small chillum, and go to the park to smoke. I lead her to a secluded spot I've found, and out comes the weed. She shoves some weed into the chillum, and shows me how to hit it. I take it, and I'm experiencing some nervousness. This is my first mind altering substance, so. I finally get around to taking a hit. It was small, but I didn't cough (I was trying to impress her. I impressed myself, since I hadn't even smoked cigarettes before this). We pass back and forth a couple times, I've take 3 small/med hits. Still feeling nothing except slight paranoia. The next 2 hits were large hits that made me cough my lungs out. Then I start to notice my feet feel numb, my tongue is odd, and my whole body is heavy. We decide to head back to my car on the side street.  Once we've escaped the secluded spot it's about 50m to the car, but all I wanna do is lay down in the brighter than normal green grass. She convinces me to keep going and we get to my car. By this point I am super high, have what I would now call the spins, so I grabbed her hand for something to hold onto and then closed my eyes to try and deal with these new sensations. After spinning in my head for a while, I opened my eyes. It was like a reawakening, I'd totally forgotten that we were still at the park. After that we put some music on, lay back, chilled and talked to each other. 
But wait, it's prom night and this girl goes to a different school and as such had already gone to her prom. Incidentally, 2 weeks before meeting her (1 month before prom), I had asked a separate girl to prom. It was totally non serious, but basically it meant I was going to prom with a girl who was not the girl I actually wanted to be at prom with (being the gf). I know, awkward, but I honor commitments, and didn't wanna leave this other girl dateless. 
Fast forward, pictures are at 5, but it's 4:40 and I'm still coming down. I'm feeling mostly okay, so I take the gf home and proceed to go get dressed, and rush to the picture area. TERRIBLE COTTONMOUTH. Anyway we go to prom and I just felt so whacked out the whole time. 

4/20, prom, smoked, whacked out the whole time 
I'm still with the same gf almost 2 years later. 
This may be a bit long, but I kind of feel like there's some setup that needs to happen.
I was always the "good, Christian" kid in high school, but I guess I was what you would call a "social butterfly." I hung out with the skaters/pot heads as well as the "straight edge" kids. My best friend, James, was a smoker, so I was pretty familiar with it, but I had never actually seen weed being smoked before. He always told me that if I wanted to smoke to let him know, but never once tried to pressure me into it.
I was in a band when I was 16 with a couple of guys (Luke and Dustin); both had smoked weed and cigarettes before, but neither did regularly. About a month before I turned 17 I started getting curious about expanding my horizons. One day after band practice we decided that we wanted to smoke cigarettes. Since I had never smoked before they decided that I was the one that needed to go buy the cigarettes. As a 16 year old kid I was nervous. We went to this tiny little convenient store in the bad part of town, known for selling cigarettes to anybody, and they told me what to buy. Smoking cigarettes in my backyard was my first ever "head change," which opened me up to new experiences.
Fast forward about two weeks when my friend Luke calls me up and he says, "Hey man, do you want to drink some alcohol tonight?" He had a work friend who had some booze and he was going to go drink with him. Like I said, I had been expanding my horizons lately, so I figured why not? We invited Dustin along, who didn't drink or smoke anymore, but was willing to be the designated driver. Luke's parents were out of town, so we knew we had a place to go crash at afterwards.
We get to this guy's house (I don't even remember his name) and he invites us all in and ushers us to his room. I'm not sure exactly how old he was, but I would guess he was probably around 21. We all take a seat, either on the bed or on the floor, and do the general meet and greet. He shows us some of his cool stuff (bo staff and sais) and then he turns to his mini-fridge and pulls out a bottle. I was completely uninitiated with liquor at the time, so I had no idea what this "Everclear" was.
He proceeds to pour himself, Luke, and I a glass of about half Dr. Pepper and half Everclear. I remember being a little taken back by the taste, but the dude offered us some Cheez-its which did help mask the taste. We all start playing Halo (the first one) multiplayer while eating Cheez-its and drinking this half and half concoction.
A little ways in Luke is starting to get tipsy. It was incredibly noticeable as he was starting to get shitty at Halo and sway back and forth. On the second round Luke gives up, being too drunk, but I'm not feeling anything yet so I finish my second Dr. Everclear and his. Our host and I go another round with this brew, but still I'm feeling nothing, so we start taking shots of straight Everclear.
At this point I'm three and a half glasses in and have gotten about 3 or 4 shots down and I'm feeling completely normal. He could tell I was getting disappointed as Luke is obviously drunk. He turns to me and says, "Do you want to smoke?" "Yeah, I've got cigarettes in the car," I said. "No man, I mean weed."
We all go out into his backyard where he lifts up a flower pot, which had a pipe and a little baggy underneath it. He loads some of his weed into the pipe and hands it to me. I look around at these guys, having no idea what to do. They explain to me that I'm go to hold the carb on the side, light it, inhale, then let go of the carb. They tell me to hold it in as long as I possible could.
So, I do exactly that. I hold the carb, light the bowl, inhale for way too long and then let go of the carb. They're all staring at me as I'm holding my breath. I was on the swim team for a bit in high school and played in band, so I had pretty good lung capacity, but even I was starting to loose it. I kept waiting... and waiting... until I couldn't keep it in any longer. I burst forward with a cough that probably woke the neighborhood, gagging and nearly throwing up. They all have a good laugh and explain that I just need to hold it in for ten seconds or so.
This guy and I finish off the bowl when he asks, "How are you feeling?" "Fine," I reply, "nothing different."
We decide to call it a night and go home, so we all usher into Dustin's car. Just about the time Dustin starts driving I start to feel this weird feeling creep up on me. Everything is going super fast as we drive, but I feel like I'm stuck in slow-motion. I remember I wanted to stick my head out of the window, like a dog, so that's what I did. I even let me tongue hang out; the breeze felt nice and cool on that hot summer night. Dustin had never been to Luke's dad's house before and it was pretty difficult explaining where this house was on the outskirts of town. We kept telling his to look for the "X" and make a turn after that. What we meant was, "Look for the intersection sign," but that wasn't what was coming out.
We make it to Luke's house safely and decide to take a swim. After jumping in I quickly realize that I have somehow forgot all of my swim lessons, but luckily my instinct to "doggy paddle" kicks in and it works. Dustin is having a great time watching his friends act like fools while also making sure nobody would drown. We tried playing "Jump or Dive" (as you're jumping off of the diving board somebody yells out "jump" or "dive" and you try to do that while in the air), but the only thing I was capable of was falling into the water. Luckily nobody got hurt and we had a great time.
We eventually got tired and passed out wherever we could find a comfortable spot. Dustin and I wake up to Luke passed out naked on the couch. He quickly realizes that he had pissed all over the couch while we slept, so we washed the pillow covers, set the pillows out in the sun to dry, and sprayed them with a shit-ton of Febreeze (we weren't very smart). As we're leaving I notice Dustin has some crazy smudges all over his passenger side window, so I ask him about it. He asks, "You don't remember?" Apparently I wanted to stick my head out of the window like a dog, but forgot to roll the window down. He had the AC on, being that it was summer, and I had drooled all over his window. 
That was the beginning of a very inebriated summer.
***: I tried alcohol and weed for the first time in the same night. Got completely wasted, drooled all over a car, tried swimming, and started a love affair with marijuana that would last over ten years.
I've always felt like mine was a little strange. It actually wasn't the first time I smoked, but the first I got high. 
As I said, I had smoked before this, but there was only 3 pounds worth (that's £'s) between three of us. God knows how my friend had managed to get a 3-bit but needless to say it did nothing to any of us. 
Anyway, a few weeks afterwards, me and another of my friends were in this slightly sketchy area of town and decided to go to a shop and buy some snacks. We then decided to sit right in the middle of the car park opposite to eat them (this again, I can't wrap my head around). So, we were sat in the middle of a car park, eating crisps and biscuits, and both of us have quite long hair. It's hardly surprising when two girls walk past and think we're stoners. So one of them shouts over to us and asks to borrow a lighter, my friend gets up and lends them his as he smokes cigs, and comes back looking all smug. I ask him what he's looking like that for and he replies something along the lines of "that's not a cig they've got." 
Well, a few minutes later the girls come back and ask if we smoke weed, we say yes, and they sit down and immediately start rolling this giant spliff, I mean it was at least half a foot long, if not two thirds, and it was to this day, the smoothest smoke I've ever had. So we pass this thing round all four of us, and we share our snacks and cokes, but I'm still not really feeling it. The girls roll another and I don't protest.
We have this other one as well before two guys come over, presumably the girls boyfriends, and start throwing all sorts of insults at me and my friend. We jump up, expecting to have to run away or something (they were a LOT older than us) but the weed's got other plans. The second I'm on my feet, what was probably a whole eighth or so hits me like a train. It takes all my energy and focus to stay standing and as I look over to my buddy, he is definitely having the same problem. Needless to say, these two guys are howling at us now, and I don't blame them, we probably looked pretty funny. Anyway they leave and it takes us about ten minutes to figure out how to get over the car pack fence, but we eventually do. 
We spent the rest of the afternoon walking around, chilling out and just enjoying ourselves, I didn't come down for about 4 hours, looking back it was one of the best days of my life.
Two kind girls shared their weed, almost jumped by their BFs, best day of my life.
EDIT: I was 15 at the time if any of you were interested.
Thank you for your thoughtful post on the issue.  There are usually reasonable arguments for and against this type of thing.  Unfortunately it can be difficult to find clear explanations for them.  
Of course, a reasonable argument in favor of a policy doesn't automatically mean that the resulting policy is good, but it is much more helpful to read an explanation of what the policy is actually trying to accomplish than it is to read conclusory "explanations" like "corporations are evil and trying to screw us!!"  
I hate being told what to believe, and I appreciate it when someone takes the time to actually enhance my ability to reach my own conclusions.  Thanks again!
Well, all those changes I mentioned took place at the same time as a democratic opening; Mexico was led by one political party for 80 years until 1994 (legislature/governorships) and 2000 (presidency). The system was greased by corruption, nepotism, cronyism, shady business dealings, and corrupt and very powerful government-sanctioned labor unions (I did my undergraduate thesis on them!). All these structural, long-term issues were either ignored or actively harnessed for political purposes. So it's more of a political science/sociology/economics argument than a purely economic one, but my honest view is that NAFTA, plus structural market reforms, plus the democratic opening, allowed these issues to become worse or come to public light. So no, Mexico wasn't necessarily the best candidate at that particular time for some of the "bad" NAFTA things, and it was in a fairly vulnerable position, but I think the country's relatively poor growth and social dislocation after NAFTA - some of which has been severely overstated - was mostly due to domestic factors and not NAFTA itself, though there are some isolated sectors that certainly got the short end of the stick. 
anyway, most of those problems existed before; NAFTA didn't necessarily make them worse in most cases, but rather illuminated them in tandem with other changes at the time in the political sphere.
I worked at a never ending pasta restaurant and you should not have had to pay for it. they take the "pay for it or write it up approach" and it's illegal for them to require you to pay for it. 
Take the write up, they have to document it either way for their records. The reason the manager doesn't want to comp it is because they have a budget for comps and if they over it they lose their bonuses. Fun fact they also lose there bonus if their small wares order goes over, so every time yo drop a dish...they cringe that much more. 
Aside from that we had a walk out at ours, not my table but I was there. It was a bunch of young high school kids. They walked out and the girl went after them, they took off up into the woods behind the restaurant and left their car there. 
We called the police and they came and wrote up a report. Now the waiting game began, the manager knew that the kids weren't coming back to pick up that car until the night so they waited until the last car left and bingo...they got the plate number. 
The police got in touch with the owner and their parents made the kids come back apologize, pay the bill, tip the waitress and made them give us an ice cream social. They brought in huge tubs of ice cream with all the toppings and just gave enough for the whole staff and then some. It was awesome and nice to see the parents actually caring and making the kid's do the right thing.
 dont pay for walk outs, kids ran off on the check and their parents made them back and pay the bill and give the whole staff ice cream.
Just wanted to jump on your point here, « personal » AP items mean little since Riot can tweak that Champion's ratios just to adapt to their taste (see Cassiopeia : she may have &gt;9000 AP lategame but Riot specifically tweaked her ratios). It, however, is a question of whether they want that champion to synergize well or not with *Rabaddon's Deathcap*.
**Edit :** By that I mean... Let's say the Hextech Core gives 200 AP (it's 155 but I want easier numbers to compute). Riot wants Viktor's *Death Ray* to gain a ~150 damage powerspike (for whatever reason) when Viktor finishes his *Hextech Core*. Therefore, they will give it a 0.75 AP ratio (it's 0.7 currently). *However !* They also want to reward Viktor for going glass canon (i.e. *Rabaddon's Deathcap*), so they keep the +200 AP item but will probably decrease *Death Ray* ratio if the need arise.
Saying that « he's the only guy who can build more than 2 +120 AP items » would work only if every champion in the game was identical. If that argument was solid, it would indeed be a « Viktor is plain better » argument, which Riot seems pretty wanton to avoid (see Toplane Disaster and current Jungle issues), preferring « Viktor is better *in that situation, filling that role* » - for good reasons.
: It gives Riot an additional lever (Personal AP Bonus)  to push Viktor in a specific direction.
**Edit 2 :** My AP example sucks please don't throw rocks at me.
Sorry for not responding to this sooner. I thought it would be on the main subreddit.
Unfortunately, I have no screencap evidence for the first part of this story. I'll remember to do that next time.
The first interaction I had with KothLoot was a brief exchange of greetings on Friday night as he came by my house along Hpoom as I was working on it. I thought he had left, but soon after that I get PMs from Cattus_ and (if I recall correctly) Just Zero, saying that KothLoot was trying to kill my donkey, which Cattus_ was using to bring some materials from their place to mine. When I went out front to see what was going on, KothLoot ran up and started hitting me with a stone sword. I pulled out my own sword, at which point he ran off, with me chasing after him. We ran down Exultant to a field southeast of town, where he started pillaring up on a stack of dirt and asked me to stop chasing him. I told him to come down and explain himself, and when he wouldn't, I went up after him. (A bad idea obviously.) He kept going, so after maybe 20-30 seconds, I decided to come back down. While I had my back turned mining the cobble pillar, he jumped down, knocking me to the ground and killing me.
That's the main event; by the time I respawned and got back out there, ProgrammerDan and GTAIVisbest had pearled him. When he started PMing me, asking to be unpearled, Dan and I went into group chat with him, with the result being that he agreed to mine 3 SCs of sand for me as reps, mainly for the Sharpness III diamond sword which was not recovered after I died, and I would drop all charges against him. However, when Dan released him, he promptly refused to honor our agreement and did the stupid pillar thing again. He was eventually repearled, and after sending me a few angry PMs, apparently logged off for the night.
The defendant attempted to kill me and my donkey without provocation, eventually succeeding in killing me (although I understand this may not count as murder, since I was chasing him at the time), and then reneged on the reps deal. 
**Part 2**
When I logged in this morning, I found that a window had been broken to gain access into my house (the one along the southern road out of town, not along Hpoom), and ~10 chests were broken, most of which had been empty or nearly so, although there were some miscellaneous building materials and other low value items in them, which were obviously now missing. According to snitch logs, this was all done by ConquestLoot, which is [Kothloot's alt]( After seeing this, I headed over to my other place, since I thought he knew the location of both houses. He had been there as well, but only placed a few blocks around the outside, with no apparent attempts to enter the house.
I told a few others about the break-in, including Blue_MuffinBoy and logged out soon afterwards. When I logged back in later, he had been pearled by Blue.

Tom Cruise is one of the greatest actors I've seen.  He is one character (usually).  He is fitted in movies rather than casted it seems.  At least the ones I know.  He makes movies like 'knight and day' or 'jack reacher.' I watch movies for him rather than what the movie is.  This means when he is in a movie that I watn to watch like 'Edge of tomorrow' or 'Oblivion,' this enhances my movie experience. 
Tom cruise is an amazing actor and I've yet to see a movie where he isn't acting well per se.  For example he is the driving force that made 'vanilla sky' watchable.
I typed "Season 69" but then adult me was like ... Dont post that crap. However 12yr old me said fk that post it. So I went with much wiser 14yr old me and decided to be clever and post it anyways wrapped in this explanation. That way I get to post it without feeling as bad.

TL-DR: Season 69
Where does this requirement of being above average come from? I play league of legends at the top level 0.001% and yea, at that point I am far above average but I didn't start ranked when I was this good, I was so bad I was given no ranking when I started. Yep, league had a special place below bronze back then called "unranked" that's how shit I was and yet I still started playing ranked and improved. Anyway, most players (70%+) are below gold there. This means 70%+ are below what I would say is the middle of the ranking system(bronze silver gold platinum diamond master challenger, where master+challenger make up the tiniest fraction of a percentage and equate to about 400 to 500 players per server so for all intense purposes we can leave them out of this), thus meaning, most of those people/all of those people shouldn't by your definition and use of the words "playing x above average" be playing ranked?
That makes no sense to me, millions of people are below average but that isn't what determines whether they "should" play ranked.
If that isn't what you mean, then you're using the words "playing x above average" incorrectly.
Above average implies you are better than the median and thus everyone below it shouldn't play ranked, by your statement.
He could play all 5 roles like dogshit for all I care, it's his rating and if he does so, he will end up in Bronze 5(By definition of the word "average" this makes him below average). 
It's simply impossible for the requirement or idea of being "better than the average" to exist when wanting to play ranked when you're using that sample to determine average. At some point, everyone was below average and learned/got better, that is part of playing ranked/casual/bots. You learn...or maybe you don't and after 1000 games you are still bronze but that's just the way it is and you will simply be below average which isn't a bad thing nor a good one, it's simply a rating. 
 He doesn't need to be "above average" to play ranked because that's just a stupid sentiment. 

Yep.  And next time you're asked, maybe instead of saying something insulting or embarrassing (like another reply suggested), you could so everyone to kneel in a circle and hold hands.  Then follow that up with a sincere sounding prayer that starts with,
"Our most kind and gracious beloved Heavenly Father, we come before thee at this time with gratefulness in our hearts for all of the things which Thou has blessed us with, even our trials which make us stronger, because we know that Thou art nigh..."  
You know when you start it like that that it's going to be really really long.  And when it ends with,
"In the name of Thy Son, who suffered for our abhorrent sins, whom we sacrifice afresh, and died on the cross that we may live with Thee for all eternity, even our dear Savior, the creator of this world and all things that in them are, all things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small, even Jesus the Christ; Amen,"
that final Amen will be so firm and unshakeable that you will never be again asked to give the blessing on the food.  
 This time, you need to read the whole thing.  
The biggest follow up is that I apologize to fast because I want to be show I have good intentions, but it makes me look less confident, or maybe less drunk...
Second follow up is to just go in because if you go straight in it looks like a natural approach, this helps alot with, also helps overthinkers like me to overthink.
Afterall the best thing that works for me is to not doubt myself when I'm aware a girl noticed me, the girl I approached only looked at me for 1 second, seems 1 second is enough if she looks interested.
 don't apologize to fast, go in immediately to make a natural approach and don't doubt your/my awareness. 
I was a temp at one of my jobs and was treated like a second class citizen by everyone but my boss.  I always felt like an outsider and an intruder amongst the staff.  It was a small organization (less than 10 people worked there) with little space and they seemed to be annoyed that I was taking up that space. The more irritable ones rolled their eyes when I walked into the breakroom or would leave passive aggressive notes if they didn't like where I put my things. They also didn't include me in important work-related announcements.  For instance, I didn't find out that someone had retired until they stopped showing up.  I'm a pretty nice guy (or so I like to think) but that didn't seem to matter.
I finished my main project a year earlier than anticipated and they didn't want to just throw me out on my ass (which I do appreciate) but they also didn't have much of anything for me to work on.  Having a light workload may sound nice but trust me, it's terrible.  I basically had one project to work on for 40 hours a week and it was something that I normally might've spent no more than 2-3 hours per week on in a normal job.  I was miserable.
I ended up giving a month's notice (it was required by my contract) and accepted a job outside my field just to get out of there.  I was treated better and actually had health insurance at the new job, which was nice.
***: I was a temp with a former employer and was treated like shit.  Gave my notice and accepted a job outside of my field just to get the hell out of there.
My prediction: Arkas will take out Pause but not before taking some serious damage. Arkas is fairly isolated from his team (at least ~15-20 seconds away from Kurt, can't tell exactly how far from Doc due to no vids). Arkas continues to fight the rest of ND, killing Beef, but eventually falls to Guude in battle. 
Immediately after Guude slays Arkas, Doc arrives on the scene. Doc kills Guude and Kurt arrives late killing Baj. Doc and Kurt then try frantically to get all the gear and pearls from ND into chests but in their haste to pick up items they are surprised by Team Reddit. 
Nebris and Vechs team up to kill Doc and BTC cunningly finds Kurt killing him in a very close battle. Reddit then decides to head for the End but see New People going for the portal as well. 
The Episode ends with New People and Reddit in battle near the Portal.

**PauseUnPause was slain by Arkas**

I used to only be on the computer to browse NoFap and try to encourage others. But all of sudden the posts were all 'First time on NoFap, I'm starting today my cleanliness' and it was about a third of the new posts, than the rest were mix of 'Fappers are scum', 'hooray for [insert number of days clean here]' and 'NoFap is good for getting you laid'. It's good to see the come back of motivational stuff and methods of helping you when you're in a tough situation. 
Back in the day of about 60k members, there was lots of information on the lines of facts and science to help focus, there was the odd guy shouting 'You had a wet dream, you failed!' but all in all it was more a community and fact forum. 
I still would promote people to do it, but please don't force people about it or shaming anybody. Strong support makes a structure stable and more a safer place.
Way too much nonsense on here recently, it must die down, we're going back to good old way of supporting instead of hating and shaming. Don't go Westboro Baptist Church on everybody who is trying or is not interested. 
I actually posted it there first, but I done fucked up the formatting and neglected to make an imgur album, so I'm sure it was very with the wall of text and mixed in links.  
And thanks! 
Yeah, I understand. :/ I upvoted him anyway because I appreciate his sentiment; it takes a lot to stand up for something like that no matter what the circumstances are. I was trying (and failed, I think, because I only said the rest in my head because TrollX is equal parts fun and scary) to make the point that the statement "I'm a feminist" should end there, since the whole point of feminism is gender equality-- your genitals have nothing to do with that belief.
 I guess I kind of hijacked his good thing and made it about feminism as a whole, which I really try hard not to do. YOU GO, OP!
Prior to a patch in December, what you're asking about was possible.  You could Whisper or Invite enemy party members (I've joined "enemy" teams before who were obviously better than the people I got matched with) and I've complimented things like the enemy Zeratul stealing all the skulls from the boss in Haunted Mines (he confessed that his heart was going crazy that we'd spot him).
But the fact is, they removed these features on purpose, almost certainly because the negative uses were more frequent than the positive uses.
**  We used to be able to, but we can't have nice things because players are jerks.**
The thing everyone seems to neglect in explaining this is that the Eagles are quite literally Deus Ex Machina. Everyone complains that the Eagles are such a Deus Ex kinda cop out way to save the day, but in reality they are literally sent by the gods to middle earth to watch over shit. They're not supposed to get involved in that fight, same way wizards aren't supposed to use their absurd magical powers to advance the goals of either faction. Saruman not only betrayed everyone and joined up with Sauron, he also helped create a magicked army of super soldiers and bring down the tops of mountains on the fellowship to slow their progression. Look where that landed him? Banned from the faction, killed, and his ex-comrade was sent back to middle-earth promoted to Saruman's old job. The only time Gandalf really used his power was in a 1-on-1 fight with the Balrog that had little to no bearing on the status of the war. The Balrog wasn't really part of either faction, it's just characteristically evil. 
Good Eagles know not to disobey the god that sent them. Freakishly powerful characters who are sent by deities to help sometimes are literally Deus Ex Machina by design, so complaining that they seem like a Deus Ex plot device is silly. 
Then you didnt think analyze the book too much. Its about bilbo developing who he is with the help of his friends. He learns to trust them and they trust him. But thorins greed makes it all about money and warps who he was, though he evolves past this it costs him his life to realize he was too greedy and shouldve listened to bilbo as he would have before they entered the mountain (who at the beginning of the book would have immediately caved and given him the archenstone instead of doing what he thought was right). They developed this concept more and i think they did an okay job of it but the clearly hastily thrown together love triangle just kills time. Just like the white orc bullshit which is really just a cover for having an "important" character kill fili, kili, and thorin rather than them simply dying from their multitude of wounds (which also makes more sense than them being freaking invincible up until one sword thrust). This move also cut out the fili and kili familial devotion to thorin, replacing it with dying for a girl. 
read the book again. Its simple but its fucking great. 
Privileged? I was born into the brokest of the broke family, 2 brothers and 1 sister. I struggled in school because we couldn't keep a home so we had to constantly move apartment to apartment, family to family. It was either a roof over our head or food in our mouths for a long time, combined income for my parents was less than 18k a year. I dropped out of school to get a job to help my family in what little way I could, I worked in fast food for a couple months and gave all of what I had to my parents. at 18 I decided enough is enough, I was mooching far too much off of what little my parents made to stay at home anymore, I made the decision is was better to leave so I joined the army (also the only way I would be able to pay for college). I spent four years in the army, went through airborne, air assault schools and got my badges, deployed twice, purple heart and combat action badges on my way home. I went IR to pursue college because I didn't want my kids growing up as shitty as I did, I since got my associates degree and in my first year on the job (2014) have made just shy of six figures in the year.
 I wasn't privileged, but I was not a lazy ass expected to make a come up on minimum wage. Be a go getter, nothing is handed to you.
People need to have an income of x to live. Contrary to public opinion, most people want to work to get their income. 
Employers will pay the least they can to get the people they want. If there is a surplus of labour (which is normally the case in the less educated, and hence lower paid, end of the workforce) then employers hiring in less skilled jobs will get away with paying less and less.
If employers pay less than x then in most developed countries the government will top up their salary to get to x (using food stamps, housing benefits, childcare vouchers, etc).
By raising the minimum wage to x, then the government needs to pay less out in benefits. The government could then opt to either tax less, or spend more on (for example) education (or waste it - this is government after all).
Most companies that are currently paying less than x are also making vast profits. Raising the salary costs will cut into this, but for most of these companies the salary portion of their expenses is actually pretty small. If they want to maintain the same profit, they may increase prices slightly, but the % increase in salaries for the workers will be much greater than the % increase in prices, as the salary bill is only part of their expenses.
Now that people are making x at an entry grade, then people with more experience will tend to get paid more as well. This will have the same minimal impact on prices as detailed above. But you also need to consider what people will do with this increased income - they will spend it. They will buy more of things. And when turnover increases in a business, the amount of profit needed per transaction - i.e. the % of the cost of each thing bought which is profit for the company - goes down. They can therefore reduce prices, or take the increase in profits, and this could offset the increase in salary to some extent.
 Capitalism works when there's a lot of buying and selling happening. By increasing the minimum wage, you're generally increasing the amount of discretionary spending people have whilst at the same time reducing their reliance on government. As people have more to spend, they buy more, bringing prices down and making capitalism work best. So the increased salaries will largely be balanced by increased turnover and hence there will be minimal impact on inflation.
IMHO, it would be economically chaotic. Folks who were making $30k per year would suddenly become minimum wage workers. While folks making $15k per year would suddenly have double income. Prices would go up. Unions would demand substantial pay raises to keep up with the sort of pay raises that non-union folks were getting. Retirees would get shafted. Government handouts would have to go up to keep up with inflations. Taxes go up. 
Relatively speaking a lot of folks get shoved towards the bottom and inflation screws them.
There would be significant inflation but at this point in our over-extended, technology heavy economy the main effect will be unemployment.
It doesn't seem an exaggeration to say most people today believe employers are evil monsters hording billions of dollars while they work for pittance.  Leaving aside the big banks and the mega corporations for which this has some truth, the belief is simply a lie.
The average guy works for another average guy that has managed to scrape together a few tens of thousands of dollars and open a restaurant, mechanic shop, etc.  He does not have some mythical cave overstuffed with $100 bills.
The FIRST thing to know about economics is EVERY employee must bring in more money than they earn.  That's what pays the overhead like lights, heat, and property taxes.  Regardless of how much you, and your employer, wish things were different.  If you cost more to keep than to let go then go you must.
Inflation is the first order effect of raising costs, wages in this case.  If the market will pay more the business can just raise prices and it's position remains the same.  Its workers may even see an improvement in their situation.  But taken on a macro level all prices will go up.
This leads to the second order effect.  If the market cannot support higher prices the business will cut costs.  That almost universally means labor costs.  4 people can work harder and do pretty much the same thing at 5 - a 20% reduction in employment.
Today though technology has progressed to the point that humans can be replaced by machines - almost a second industrial revolution.  One cotton gin replaced scores of workers.  Now a touchscreen can replace all your cashiers. 
In a healthy economy that isn't actually a bad thing.  The displaced worker will find a job where his energies are put to a more productive use and everyone ends up better off.  But we are no where near that world.
What you have today is an economy barely clinging to the last thread of a socialist system that has made promises it simply cannot afford to keep.
The Fed will have to print money out of thin air to create these new dollars.  And that will cause some inflation.  But it will be muted by raising unemployment.  The government will respond with more social programs, which will require far more money than the increase in minimum wage.  Taken on whole our debt to productivity curve passed the high point and has been squarely into diminishing returns for probably 20 years.
The massive unemployment will keep inflation from skyrocketing -- at first.  Every paper money empire ends in hyperinflation.  But we're not there yet.
Here's how I do math as a small business owner:
Most of my income comes from selling the products I manufacture. In a month I may make and sell 400 units, bringing in revenues of $10000, or $25/unit. I have one guy helping me with manufacturing, and I pay him $10/hour for 20 hours per week, so $200/week or about $800/month. That works out to about $2/unit going towards his pay.
If I suddenly have to pay him $15/hour, then it'll cost me about $1200/month or about $3/unit. That gives him a 50% raise. If I want to recoup those costs, I would have to raise the cost per unit by 4% ($25 to $26).
So, as I see it, if the minimum wage went up, my product would cost 4% more (or I make a little less per unit), but a huge number of people suddenly have the increased buying power to buy it, so my sales volume would increase more than enough to offset my added costs.
It should be noted that I'm in no way an economist, so I may be missing something in all of this... In my reality though, any decisions are based on balancing the profit per item vs the volume of Items I can sell.
 My prices would inflate, but incomes increase way more, proportionally.

The central bank targets inflation, so there wouldn't be any effect. If inflation increased, the Fed will raise interest rates, which makes holding cash more attractive. That counters the inflation increase. It's called the Taylor rule, and since we've followed it we've tamed inflation.
there wouldn't be inflation because the Fed would increase interest rates.
I worked at a "fast casual" cafe national chain.  We served lunch food (soups, salads, sandwiches) and bakery/coffee shop food (breads, pastries &amp; sweets, coffee &amp; related drinks). It was kinda pricey for what it was, but maybe that's just me being used to getting my employee discount. An average meal would be about $10-14 and the ingredients were decent quality. I was a cashier and barista there. Customers would come in and order off the overhead menu behind the counter. We would ring them up and give them a numbered pager, their drink cups (if it's self-serve) and bakery items. When the food was prepared, their pagers would go off and they'd come pick up their food. I made $8.50. Since Minimum wage increased, the franchise has been phasing out workers and replacing them with machines. Got rid of nearly all the cash registers (and cashiers) and replaced them with "touch-screen ordering systems." Customers can also place their orders through the mobile app and website. The customer gets an order number and sits down at their table with a number. We bring out the food to the table number and that's it. The franchise let probably about half of the workers go after the price increase. There's a lot less workers (like 6 or 7 per shift instead of like 15 at a time like before) and the workload isn't too much more. We do the same amount of work in the kitchen, and there are one or two runners at a time that bring out food to the customers. We save a LOT of time by skipping the talking-to-customers part. We make more money now, ($10.75 for me) but my manager said they're still saving a lot of money with the machines. They cost money, but they save a lot of money from worker wages and benefits. So I guess in a micro level here, a raise in the minimum wage resulted in job loss. 
 a restaurant I worked at replaced cashiers with electronic ordering kiosks and web-based ordering in order to save money after minimum wages went up. Bunch of workers lost their jobs, rest got better pay. 
Shooting in a raw format is never wrong when it comes to post-production. The more data and detail there is, the more you can do with it.
In this case, dog vision, removing the saturation of colors can be easily done even without RAW, since you only take away and don't have to crank up a value.
Replacing the entire red to green band of the spectrum however is probably easier to pull off if you have raw data.
Use a raw format whenever possible. 
There a many psychology studies on prices and unfortunately it does make a big difference crossing the .99 to $1.00, even more so when $999.99 to $1,000. 
Even with taxes added after. People know they will be paying more but that doesnt factor into the decision making. when you think oh this car is only $2000 more but comes with x, your not thinkig the extra $240 in tax you have to pay.
TLDR your consumers are stupid, but redbull gives you wings
L4D. I worked a job that was 12 hour shifts, 4 days on, 4 days off, 3 days on, 3 days off. I spent every waking moment playing that and the sequel L4D2.  I became that master of 15 min meals, 15 min showers, head shots and in-air hunter kills.
 I knew every glitch, and every exploit. I saved thousands, and slaughtered those who jumped in just to shoot good players. I lived and breathed that series for two years. 
It was where I experienced my first and only online relationship, with a sexy voiced man. He knew all my secrets, all my dreams, because all we had were our voices and the game. We were a team. We owned that game together.  
 Four years later my life has changed dramatically. I lost my job because the company I worked for lost their contract. This put my in serious debt as I had been taking all my years of excellent pay and helping my sister raise my niece. It's what I moved to this province for. I finally had enough of my older sibling (after ten years of my and her father's assistance, and her 10 years of unemployment)  putting me in dangerous situations (I would bring her back from druggie apts, act as security from getting attacked while "out on the town", or just be back up in case her new adventure of sex with a stranger went wrong). Taking my niece out when her mom was too tired, and being stood up, dismissed, or asked for more money after I moved out and tried to stay in contact. I am now a few k in debt, and working hard to get out, while struggling with some mysterious pain near my hip, and fibromyalgia, and a SO who is sleeping with his first cousin (I found out too late and can't move until I work on my debt). 
I miss my old beast Xbox. I miss that game. I miss getting lost in the thrill getting everyone through the final chapter and making connections with people from around the world.
/stupid sad rant
 
 

** L4D &amp; L4D2**
Prepare yourselves, peasants! Bow before the ULTIMATE NO-LIFER! I'm choosing to not give a fuck about the singular "video game" asked for in the title. I made a list: 
* **Super Smash Bros. (Series)**. I've probably sunk 200 in the original, 2000 in Melee, 2000 in Brawl, and 100 in SSB4 (so far). Looking at this now, I've played FAR TOO MUCH SMASH IN MY LIFE, GOD HELP ME. 
* **World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King**. 1200 hours. Would've played more, but my computer broke down and WoW kind of died with it for me. 
* **Minecraft**. 400 hours according to Xfire, but I stopped using Xfire like 4 years ago... Soooo... I'm willing to say 1500+ hours. 
* **Terraria**. 800 hours according to Steam. Including offline play, it's 1000. 
* **Diablo II**. Played it originally with my cousin near every day for a few years, bought it myself later. Probably ~800 hours. (200 confirmed from Xfire, but again, I stopped using that years ago, and that doesn't count me and my cousin's logged time.) 
* **Sauerbraten**. 400 hours. I bet you've never heard of it, and it'll never be heard of again. *(Wipes away nostalgia-tear.)*
* **WarRock**. 200 hours. Ayup. Fuckin' hated that game. *I want to play it again...* :[ 
* **FTL**. 200 hours according to Steam. 
* **Advance Wars (Series)**. I've got 400 in Dual Strike (according to in-game timer), and probably more in Days of Ruin, so 1000 total. 
* **Fire Emblem (Series)**. 350 in Awakening (according to my 3DS), and around that or more in FE7. 700 total. 
* **Kid Icarus: Uprising**. 300 hours according to my 3DS. 
* **Pokemon (Series)**. I can't even begin to calculate it, too many games, too many runs, so I'll just total it at 2500 hours across all games/gens (including spin-offs). 
* **Far Cry 3**. I don't want to overestimate what I don't know, so I'll just say 200 hours. 
* **Mario Party (Series)**. Combined time from 1, Advance, 5, and 6 ≈ 800 hours total. 
* **Mario Kart: Double Dash!!** Fuck. I played this one so much back in the day that I can't enjoy it anymore. Probably 500 hours. 
* **Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door**. Across all playthroughs... 250 hours is a solid bet. 
* **Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3: Full Burst**. I watched as the clock rolled 100 hours in my original playthrough. But by now I'm confident it's at least 200. 
* **Resident Evil 4**. I'm surprised I'm not tired of this game yet. Also happy at the same time. 500 hours. 
* **Call of Duty (Series)**. Specifically, 200 hours in MW2, 1000 in BO, and 600 in MW3. 
* **Goldeneye**. Far too many Saturdays with my buddies to let this one slip by. Most likely... 300 hours. 
* **Metroid: Fusion**. 300 hours, I'm pretty confident. 

Calculating these estimates, I total 20,000 hours (read below) among my (most-played) games. Divided by 24 ≈ 833 days. About 2 and a quarter years. Seems about right for the bigger games. So, I've been rambling, and I doubt people will seriously give a shit about my stupid list, but it was fun making it, and it was fun to put things into perspective by looking at my collection and recalling my gaming life up to this point. **NOW DOWNVOTE ME!** 
**Edit:** Forgot one or two entries. By this point, I've used Steam, (classic) Xfire, my 3DS, in-game timers, and Unikgamer.com to research my gaming history. 
* **Cave Story**. (Including the original, DS port, 3DS version, and CS+ on Steam.) 200 hours. I love this game so much I'm making a fan game for it. If you haven't played this game, for the love of god look it up. 
* **Dragon Quest IX**. Knew I was forgetting something. Booted up my main file and have 214 in it, but including fringe files, 250 in total. 
* **World of Tanks**. Thanks to a recent gift and a couple glitches, I had a lot of premium time. So, I tried to game out, and became obsessed. Spent all week cooped up. Easily 200 hours. 
So, I guess I should actually try to form a small "top" list. 
1. **Super Smash Bros. Brawl**
2. **Super Smash Bros. Melee**
3. **Minecraft**
4. **World of Warcraft**
5. **Call of Duty: Black Ops**
I really wanted to put a Pokemon game or two in there (specifically Emerald and Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue team), but those **individual** games above outstrip my hours in the combined Pokemon series. 
Edit 2: Why am I getting upvotes? I expected a hail of ". Thanks for the karma, I guess. Game on, brothers. 
Behind the obvious answer of League of Legends, honestly Dark Souls for me. Over 2 consoles and currently PC, I logged maybe a bit over 1,000 hours in that game (which isn't much compared to some). Always impressed me how much I played that, considering it being a fairly linear RPG.
 Dark Souls 1 cause League doesn't count
It's sad how true this is. I played that game 4-6 hours a day when I was younger. For years I would come home from school, do my homework, and play the game until I went to bed. One evening I came home to find the account hacked, and after trying for a while I was not able to recover it. At the time I felt like my life was over, but looking back on it that was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. I can't imagine where I would be now if I continued down that road. Now I am able to pour the dedication I put into that game into myself, and I love the results.
 at the time getting hacked seemed bad, looking back it was a good thing.
No it wasn't open world at all.
Only 8 players can join a game. When you create a game, a map is generated. There are five "acts" (think of them like countries or continents), in each you start in a town/encampment which is neutral territory, where the NPCs are. You then get quests which take you through the story. 
Your level 1 character quickly gains XP and rewards. Once you've been through the 5 acts and beaten the last boss of act 5 (last quest) you've technically beaten the game, but you can start it again at the next difficulty. There are three difficulty levels, normal, nightmare and hell.
But that's basically the single player, adventure part of the game. The replayability comes from:
- Random generation: each new game you create online has a new randomly generated map. The areas are always the same, but their layout always changes. The monsters are also randomly generated. Most importantly, the items are random. Every time you kill a monster, it can drop items of different types: normal, socketed (normal but with holes in them in which you can make runewords), magic (1 or 2 random additions to the item from a list of possible magic attributes), rare (4 to 6 random magic additions to the item), set items (named items with predetermined magic abilities that come in sets of 2 to 8 and get even more abilities the more of them you're wearing) and unique items (named items with predetermined abilities).
- There's over a hundred of base items, and each base item exists in 3 differing qualities that kinda go together with the 3 difficulty levels, and each base item can drop in the aforementioned varying types, and each drop will be completely unique. There are **billions** of possible combinations for rare items. Most unique items have varying stats (like for example a stat listed as +10-20 strength, so every time it drops it gets different values), making "perfect" unique items much more valuable than the one with lesser stats. For example. a player could wait hundreds, hell, even thousands of gameplay hours in hopes of maybe once finding that very rare necromancer weapon that gives enemies minus 40-50% to poison resistance. It might take a year for one to drop, and even then, you might get one with "crappy" stats.

- 7 different player characters with 30 different skills each. There are hundreds of different "builds" you could make, and unlike most MMORPGs where there's not much incentive for players to create several characters, Diablo 2 players generally liked to make a lot of characters. You could play the game for years and still want to make yet another char because you haven't yet tried that could assassin build that throws ninja stars.
- Because of the wide variety of characters builds and rare items that suit one character but not another, the **trading** and **hoarding** aspect of the game was quite important. You find a weapon that's useless to your char, you sell it to someone else that needs it, either for something you need or for some item widely accepted as currency. 
Anyway I'm rambling on... 
** it was a hugely popular game, with infinite possibilities and a very addicting drop system.**
I think Diablo was the first game I ever played on the internet and thought it was awesome. Few weeks later one of my buddies got Diablo 2. We hardly ever hung out just us but damn I played that game and became obsessed. He let me hang out all the time and even gave a good share of his game time to let me get my own Barbarian looking sexy. In exchange I brought my ps2 and we shared. We would just switch from PC to console and help each other however we could with the game time we had. At the start of that summer we barely liked each other and by the time Diablo 2 was done we had became best friends. 12 years later and he's still a bad ass. Damn good fire sorc too!
 Diablo 2 gave me a friend fo life.
I chilled on WoW when I did a /played and found out I had like 3 years played. That was one account ago. Probably have another 1 or 2 on this one since I chilled out.  
You just realize one day, man, I could have done x, y, and z in that time.
EDIT: I just did the math on all toons on this account, I have approx 270 days. That's not including the 3 years previous.
** I've literally spent nearly 4 years or more inside of a video game world. The scary thing is my wife probably has me beat by at least half as much.**
About 1365 here and I finally did start regretting it. Having kids made a big difference, also. One day you just wake up and wonder what you could have done in that time.
Keep in mind that this is across all my toons and over two accounts in the time the game has been out. This also is just one game. This does not include all of the RIFT, ESO, Vanguard, EQ2, Guild Wars 2, Age of Conan, Secret World, and all the other MMOs.
The scary thing is there are people who've spent a lot more than that.
Hell, there are people who have 1000+ on one toon.
** We're talking days while everyone else is talking hours. This would equate to 32,760 hours. Fuck just doing the math and typing that in I want to cry.**
I have an unknown amount of playthroughs and hours devoted to the Mass Effect trilogy. From Shepard to the Multiplayer to the "horrible" ending, I love those games. Some of my fondest memories are from the franchise, and I feel like the galaxy is more expansive than that of Star Wars. (And trust me, I love Star Wars too.) I'm still learning something new about these games each time I play.
I also spent a crazy amount of time with Kingdom Hearts. The only one I haven't beaten is Birth By Sleep, though I'm currently working on it, and have played through all the rest numerous times.
Mass Effect Trilogy and Kingdom Hearts are awesome.
Mine is Final Fantasy Tactics. I've must have beaten that game at least 50+ times by now. And I play to completion. As in I want my motherfucking Summoner to get hit by the motherfucking Zodiac summon spell and survive. I've played the game with using all 5 characters per battle or Ramza only. A few of my games took months to play because of the whole Zodiac summon thing. Collecting the best equipment in the game is quite difficult, especially when you only have one character to play with. I also own every single port of the game. PS1, PSP and iOS. I've played the two other final fantasies but not as much as FFT:WoTL.
I am a Final Fantasy Tactics God.
I remember playing Total Annihilation with a buddy against the AI.  We quickly destroyed the vanilla AI on its hardest setting.  So we found a non-cheating AI, Mostly Harmless.  It wrecked us, so we started against one easy MH, and built up to the point we were taking down multiple hard MH AI.  We then played against some real life friends who weren't as fanatic about practicing as we were.  We had massive flights of aircraft done before they had their infrastructure up.
***  My cat's breath smells like cat food.
I don't know why, but I just can't get into SSB4. It feels...lacking; Melee felt new and fresh over SSB, and then Brawl introduced Subspace Emissary. SSB4 has Smash Run/Smash Tour. =_=; I don't know. Maybe I just ought to have more people over at my house instead, because playing online feels lacking. You don't have the same kind of shouts.
muh nostalgia and muh lack of adapter (seriously I imported a damned white controller for nothing)
It's really not as hard as most people make it out to be. 90% of mobs can be beaten by blocking, having their attack bounce off your shield, and then counterattacking. 90% of bosses can be beaten by circle-strafing them. You just need to be patient. It's challenging, in that it's very punishing. If you make mistakes, you get bitch-slapped for it.
 Fortunately, every time you die, you always know exactly why you died, and you learn from it. You know that you attacked to soon, you dodged too late, you didn't conserve your stamina, you pulled too many enemies at a time, you misread the cue for an attack, ect. It takes time to learn, but once you learn it, it becomes like breathing.
Plus, the level design is top-notch. I've never seen anything like it. You're almost constantly going up or down,. There's like one loading screens unless you die. It's all one, giant cohesive world with a lot of shortcuts. You can see places you've been, and place you'll be going, far off in the distance. You can be exploring for an hour and find a different route into a place you were at hours ago.
 If you pick the Master Key as a starting gift, you can sequence break the shit out of the game, getting weapons and armor way before "intended". Even if you don't, a good player can get a weapon, without the master key, that's normally found half-way through the game, just a three minute run from the end of the tutorial. You just gotta dodge all the infamous skeletons. Doesn't matter if you die after you get it, you keep everything you've collected (except souls) even after you die. And even then, if you go back to the place you died, you can collect all your souls you had from your last death.
Speaking of weapons, nearly all of them have their own moveset, and all of them that aren't obviously terrible can carry you through the whole game as long as you upgrade them. It's all about preference.
Yeah, I love this game a lot. I could go on for hours. You can play for hours too, with PvP and Co-op! Challenge runs, like playing through using only a shield as a weapon! Fist weapons only! Make a character with green skin and PvP cosplaying as The Hulk! No healing! I'll stop now.
 Imma let you finish, but Dark Souls is the best game of alll tiiimmee!
I agree and disagree.  
EQ definitely set the stage for WoW to be the success that it is.  But MMOs are certainly not based off of EQ.  
EQ borrowed concepts from already existing games at the time such as MUDs (text based Multi-User Dungeons), Existing MMOs such as Ultima Online, 1st person RPGs such as Elder Scrolls (1 &amp; 2).  and the biggest common denominator these all share is Dungeon's and Dragons.
If EQ was never released, games such as Wizardry or Ultima would have likely ventured forward and eventually done what EQ did, most likely not far after the 1999 release. 
Brad Mcquiad and company was smart enough to get in the front line of where this Genre and sub section of RPGs was headed, and capitalized. 
The industry standard was already moving in the direction EQ was, the Team just did it first.
Yes, yes you are. And I'd also like to predict that what you're missing is the reward mechanism in your brain for this sort of behaviour (you no doubt have a reward mechanism in your brain, it just isn't impressed by this sort of behaviour.)
I do play RPG's (Skyrim, etc) so I have some idea of what would be in store for me if I played a MMO. Mostly, it's the addiction of leveling up and getting new gear. You work a gnome wizard to get him to level 2, and bam! You have new spells, buffed stats and can kill things you couldn't before. BUT, you also find that there are bigger monsters out there, and if you just leveled up to 3, you could take them down, and get their gear. BUT....
All the big games have these reward systems (Battlefield, COD, WoW, LoL) and they reward not only just more gameplay, but certain types of gameplay. So yes, you are level 100 colonel in BF4, but have you killed 25 people with the blowtorch? No? Oh....well then.
I don't mean to imply that reward systems are inherently evil--in fact, I'm such a bad BF player that I appreciate that the game rewards me for things other than killing other players, because I am horrible at that. So for you, that sort of ranking up offers no promise of sweet, sweet serotonin. You may well be rewarded for doing things like participating in a bike race, or getting an orchid to bloom, or somesuch. The behavior-reward system in your brain is responsible for lots of bad addictions (gambling, alcohol, drugs, sex, etc) if you abuse it, and really MMO addiction is no different because you're hitting that serotonin switch over and over and over again. One more mission, one more raid, then I'll go.
So really, you're not missing anything.
Sorry for the long post! -- Lord_Mormont is a blowhard.
Definitely Garry's Mod over 1000hours between two accounts, all most all of it on DarkRP probably 800hrs of that on 3-4 servers, I had alot of spare time then
Then Dota2 and CSGO 450 hrs on Dota2 and 200-300 hrs for CSGO
I have alot of time
The dress in real life is black and blue. By changing the [white balance]( of the picture, it was made to appear white and gold, and this was the main picture that started circulating the net, thus engaging the whole white/gold vs. black/blue debate.
 Because Photoshop. Like the Kardashians. 
If you are going only by things that are "canon," 6 movies, Clone Wars, and Rebels, then I cannot.  Boba as a kid is just a more annoying version of the clone troopers, and in the original trilogy he has like 3 minutes of screen time and while he has cool looking armor and a cool looking ship, he doesn't have any personality.
 Boba sucks without EU.
I went to school with [one of the elites]( and her track record with the fawning new generation reads like "Not my job to educate you, shitlord. Read and indoctrinate yourself instead of extrapolating your own ideas."
The next generation of "teachers" are more subtle than Dworkin, Solanas, or that one woman  who assaulted a pro-life demonstration and jaked their signs (and may have professional ties to my old acquaintance aforementioned).
 bitches be cray, and they do exist in the wild.
I’m assuming that “this” means the effects you experienced from the Adderall and Vyvanse. And it sounds like you’re concerned that because of this, the treatments that are normally used to mitigate stimulant side effects won’t work for you. I’m not aware of any reason why this would be the case, and I think you should talk with your psychiatrist about this.
It’s *possible* that at least some of what’s happening to you is [the nocebo effect]( but all that means is that your brain/body are acting in response to something other than the physical action of the drug. It doesn’t mean that your symptoms aren’t real. The truth is that your brain often responds in very similar ways to things that might seem like they’re totally different (such as [a physical injury and rejection.]( and so something that you’re *worried* might happen can provoke the same kind of response that a physical danger would. Even if you don’t have an anxiety disorder independent of ADHD, it’s still possible that your brain’s fear response has gotten stuck in a self-reinforcing feedback loop.
*** - as far as I know, psychosomatic anxiety isn’t fundamentally different from anxiety caused by anything else. If your cardiologist has cleared you to use stimulants and you’d like to try them again, talk with your psychiatrist about your options for moving forward.
No problemo. One suggestion I've found online is calling Nintendo and saying that you purchased a new 3DS but no longer have access to the old one (it broke, you sold it, etc.). They should be able to transfer your NNID, friends list, and licenses (since you can apparently only have one 3DS linked to your account). So if you have mainly used cartridges and don't have many eshop games whose saves you care about, you can get a fresh start on your new system and download those games again. Also, there are some games that save on the SD card instead of the cartridge. I'm not sure if you have any and if you care about that.
- There may be a way to transfer your NNID, but you may have to sacrifice your digital game's saves. 
I've been a WoW player for 8 years. I've sunk enough money into that game to make a substantial downpayment on a house, or cut into my student loans, but I've made such good friends through that game I consider it worth it. 
I've been to Canada to meet some of my guild mates. I've got places to stay in Kansas, California, Seattle, Virginia, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana if I need a couch to surf on. They have a place here in Texas if they ever want to visit. 
We hang out in Axon/Mumble/Ventrilo/Skype even when we're not playing. We Facebook message each other. We've all known each other for such a long time we know about family issues and personal triumphs. I love my friends. 
It can cut into my personal time on the weekends, I suppose. It's hard for me to want to go out to a bar and spend a bunch of money on drinks when I can just do $15/mo to do stupid stuff with people I already know I enjoy. I would like to start dating and so on, but there's this caveat of "will they understand this hobby and how I feel about it". I've seen the hobby (and the game) destroy other people's lives because they just let it consume all of their time. 
**- I don't consider them a bad habit for me, but I see how they could be for other people.** 
Not having a grid to work with, for starters. Underground assets seem to just float and that can mess with your depth perception, especially in an isometric view like RCT2.
Plus, the only way to get rides/stalls down there is to drag them down from the top, meaning you have to know where you're dragging down to.
building underground is harder than building above ground, especially when you're talking about an entire park.
Sure, but I never said they said it was doomed but you can pretty much hear in their tone that they have super low expectations for universal apps (aka they don't think its going to be the cure all people want it to be). If you don't listen to Windows Weekly podcast check it out. In the last episode with Brad and Paul they are pretty tepid about universal apps because they (we) have heard the same thing since Windows Phone 7.... Just wait until 7.5, 8, 8.1, now 10. 
Besides their sentiment there is still no reason for someone to make a universal app. I keep hearing about this larger audience that potential developers will be able to reach but we have no idea what the adoption rate of Windows 10 will be, and also there are apps that do not need a desktop/Xbox counterpart. In the case of the latter, even if there would be a reason to make a desktop/Xbox counter part there is no reason to make the mobile version in the first place because there isn't enough users to justify it.
Throw that on top of the fact that it seems a lot of young developers have some sort of animosity towards MS and it just spells an uphill battle.
In that same podcast Brad brings up the point that, apparently, a lot of people in the tech industry feel we are headed towards just carrying a phone (mobile PC) that we can dock in to a larger screen to basically be our computer for everything. I'm not sure whether I agree or not but its interesting that a lot of people feel that way. More importantly Brad felt like MS basically knows they lost mobile and will just carry the mobile part of Windows along until we get to this point where we are docking our phones in to larger screens.
Wow that was a lot, sorry.
They don't think it's doomed but they don't think it's going to help much either. There are flaws in the thinking of universal apps and their applications by users in this subreddit. 
Well...for more than a month now I have been taking 20mg fluoxetine per day (for moderate anxiety+insomnia and some mild depression/ocd) in combination with daily 15mg extended release dexmethylphenidate (focalin) or less for ADHD, so my experiences are likely somewhat different.  I'm a bit lost with my situation so below I'll explain my experiences thus far. 
Within the first week I found myself more upbeat, sociable, and engaged but as time went on (and school became more demanding) I found this wore off.  
Over time I feel as though I have "mellowed out" a bit, my appetite has increased (from almost never to semi-regularly, i.e. anxiety reduction), but I am finding myself overeating even when I'm not hungry.
Lately I have been more mellow and finding sleep a bit easier and more refreshing (still could be better), but for reasons beyond my understanding, whenever I take focalin I have pretty consuming edginess (physical symptoms of anxiety) in addition to a strong desire to seek instantly gratifying things, such as binge-eating unhealthy foods, and avoid uncomfortable things, such as studying, reading, etc. (this is very frustrating, and relatively new).
In this stressed state I also find myself super-aware of my strong heartbeat and pulse around my body.  I want to shake my legs, tap my fingers, do some sort of physical movement to diminish my edgy feeling, which is not something I have experienced in years.  I also sort of enter a malaise with mental fogginess.
Further, I have been experiencing occasional twitching (perhaps myoclonic jerks) lately, which are more abundant when taking the focalin.
I know that a large percentage of people taking fluoxetine experience altered libido/arousal, but I don't seem to be affected.
I'm sort of in a limbo state and I'm avoiding taking the focalin when possible because I enter such a negative state. 
**TLDR**; 20mg prozac + 15mg or less focalin extended release per day - anxiety increasing with focalin, decreasing without, sleep somewhat improved, new states of mental agitation/fog/malaise/funk. Overall I gather from my psychiatrist that the combo is safe and tolerated well usually...just not in my case...
On a side note: it can indeed slow your metabolism of many medications and has interactions with dextroamphetamine (see: 
These I don't consider drop houses, you're just using some motherfucker you know.  And guess what?  That motherfucker you know is gonna roll on you like a slut in a gangbang, because:
1.  If they don't know what's in the pack, then your busted because they aren't going down for that.
2.  They know what's in the pack, and your going down because they are gonna get over first.
everyone "thinks" they have "friends", until those "friends" have something on you, and the those "friends" become "witnesses for the ~~defense~~ prosecution".
  
Let me tell you a story:
I was in a Co-Op queue with 3 other friends, simply because we couldn't find a match in PvP. Beat Day 1 and 2 pretty easily, but on Day 3, we fought a Kraken on Aviary. This AI Kraken was actually a bit annoying, just kiting us everywhere and spamming Vortex. We had a team of Val, Abe, Cabot, and Hyde. We got a nice dome on it at Stage 1, and got about half it's health off. Then the dome dropped. Kraken started flying away, and both Val and Abe hit it at the same time with their respective slows, while I was trying to do as much damage as I could with my Minigun. Kraken landed pretty quickly, thanks to the Tranqs and Stasis Grenades, and Cabot and I proceeded to do the stupidest thing I've ever seen. We chased after a **Kraken** with a Flamethrower and the Damage Amp. Every time it tried to take off, it fell right back to my big grin and my even bigger flame. We just chased after him, Abe and Val spamming their respective slows, while Cabot and I just had fun going to town on it.
 Tranqs + Stasis lets you chase a Kraken with a Flamethrower and the Damage Amp.
How I got over my toxicity:
A while ago, I was your average silver ADC Main, and I got pissed off A LOT. Eventually, I got so mad at the game, I gave up. I said "Instalocking Nidalee, every game, every lane" I stopped talking in chat and communicated only through pings. When I did talk, i would only say things like Nids quote's, or just put &lt;3's when deserved. I generally never get mad at the game anymore and tend to play for fun alone. From Silver 1 to Plat 4, the climb has begun.
This obviously will not work for some people (or most people), but just what i did to get out of my toxicity.
 **Don't give AF**
To be completely honest, Empathetic. I've been laughed at for being fat before and it fucking hurts and the genuine look of sadness on his face just drives it home.
Now, that being said, I took it as a wakeup call and decided to lose the weight and owned up to what I'd done to myself. Nobody made me eat too much but me. I made my body a joke, a disgusting sack of fat by age 18. I grew the fuck up and did something hard, I made myself a better person.
These lazy sacks of shit just sit around and expect everything to be handed to them. Absolutely disgusting, grown-ass adults acting like spoiled little children because they're weak, physically and mentally and that is absolutely inexcusable. This is the reason I hate fat people. 

I know exactly what kind of pain he's feeling in that image and the fact that he's too weak to do anything about it makes me hate him even more.
i am in a similar dilemma !
and this is what i think i ( you ) should do but i don't have the balls to do because i think she deserve better.
tell her the story about how you wanted to ask her out make it as if you were just bringing an old memory and pay attention to her reaction and act on it . Don't over think it 
worst case scenario you will both laugh about it and you will find yourself back at where you started .
Just do it and you will feel better.
i wish i was a better person so i can tell the girl i love that i so do . Ask her out if you think you can make her happy otherwise you will never know and you will stay in the friendzone and trust me it is not a good zone 
I'm a landlord in Texas, not Georgia so any specific Georgia laws are unknown to me and hopefully a lawyer will be around shortly, but it's really late. 
Your lease allows them access for this, so they can legally come in and inspect. They cannot go through your belongings but can open pantries, closets, etc and inspect for damage. Every landlord I know does this monthly, usually when I do I simply make a quick lap around and make pets haven't eaten window sills, no water leaks etc. You might be the perfect tenant, but most aren't and most don't report "minor" problems that are or can lead to huge problems. 
I can't imagine this is actually going to be an invasive search as much as a "yep, the building is still here", especially since this isn't university affiliated housing. 
 they (most likely) can come in and look. 
Happens too often. Person stands gawking at the fascinating process of grocery checking *until they hear the total*... then they start fishing for their method of payment.
 Get your card out! You're about to buy something.
Hmm, not quite. Simple due to the fact you can't watch native 4K content on a 4K HMD.
If you want to sit in your simulated theater with a screen in front of you, it's not going to be able to display a 4K image. The resolution of the theatre 'screen' will be quite a bit lower. 
 
You'll have 2048h and 2160h per eye of resolution. So even if the theatre screen spanned the entire FOV, you could still only achieve half 4K horizontal resolution. For a FOV filling 4K theatre screen you will need an 8K display. And to simulate a screen off in the distance at full 4K, it is going to need to be ~12K display at a guess.

Not if you define 4K content as a perfect theatre replacement. Need more resolution. 
Well the streamers would choose gods based on what their own beliefs and personalities are. Subsequently the viewers would select the streamer based on their own views over time.
I watched Jordan because his videos introduced me to Mianite, but I keep watching Jordan because he attempts to balance as per Ianite's beliefs and that is what my take in life is as well. Then I like to watch Tucker or Sonja and finally Tom with the least preference (I'm not someone that wants to see the world burn).
If Jordan becomes more Dianite like and I find that I cannot agree with his choices then I would most definitely watch Tucker's stream. For example, I didn't agree with him taking Tucker's chickens and throwing dig spells at his house. So I skipped the rest and just went to watch Tucker's version.
version: people watch specific people due to personality and Jordan's viewers tend to come to reddit. Not so much we love Jordan but agree with his views due to his god.
So I'm reminded of Neil DeGrasse Tyson regarding people who claim to have been abducted by aliens, he just said to bring something back - like a new alien technology as proof.  So if you are a professional surfer, you should have some pictures of you with your sponsors.  
The other thing I would do is just tone it down on the stuff that people may not believe. So if you dated a b-list celeb, then just say his/her first name and emphasize why this person was crazy or why it didn't work out. People are interested in failure more than success. 
Emphasize stories vs a brag list. Instead of "I was once a professional surfer" say "I tried surfing once and was pretty decent at it so I thought I would enter the 'Big Kahuna' contest. I was super nervous, yada yada yada, and that's when a rogue wave took my swim trunks right off with everyone watching." The more details the more believable.
Lastly I wouldn't not talk about who you are. I think the disbelief comes from people being more interested in themselves, and also wondering why a person with such an remarkable life would be hanging out with them.  
 evidence, stories, failure, humility
Wait so is he your boyfriend or your EX boyfriend? Cuz your title says ex but your tldr says SO. 
I agree, even though I understand why most people don't like to hear that.
MGS has some of the best female characters in video games, and it's also one of the games that deals with sexual themes in a way that is more interesting than just showing it. I loved the humor, the tension between some characters, the fact that we can find characters that aren't heterosexual... From this perspective, I am glad that some female characters can be shown as sexy, but not objectified; even after Snake finds Meryl, after having had two opportunities to see her in her underwear and one mention of her butt, he respectfully listens to her telling of her childhood and her reasons to be here, as well as her emotions about what just happened. And she then feels free to tease him a bit on codec. This alternation of serious and fun is, for me, unique of MGS, and thus it makes me mind less the fact that Kojima uses eye candy.
On the other hand, I am less sure of what he meant in MGS4, PW and GZ. Pairing PSTD with sexualization, or having a villain reveal herself in both her motives and some lingerie, to be afterward sexually tortured (or used to torture another character) in the next game seems a bit delicate for me. I can see the boldness of bringing such issues in a media that is still relatively young, and I get that Kojima can't succeed from his first try, but I did feel bothered, and still am.
For Quiet, the saddest part for me is that she is the only female character we can expect in MGS V, from the trailers. And as such, she can't have any variety, of course, but it goes in the easy way to just portray a "sexy companion" who can be both useful in combat and nice to look at.
It's not about whether male character are sexualized or not, they are of course, but the context is different. While I will welcome every attempt to bring variety to the portrayal of male characters, it won't change the fact that I am looking forward to female characters who won't show it in my face all the time. I would have loved that if Strangelove never appeared in bikini, even after you unlocked it, for example, to show how she refused to be seen this way. It's just a tiny thing that would have made me smile more wholeheartedly at a game that I otherwise love.
 this series makes more efforts than a lot of other games, but I am with you to say that it's not enough to just praise it and ignore the bad elements. I am still divided, as I'm often surprised in positive ways, but I wish that some female character would dress as they feel, instead of how people (not all people) want them to look. But the improvements put in these games for more and better female characters will probably help this evolution, while the sexy parts, as uncomfortable as it can make some of us feel, won't hopefully slow this process, because it's still mostly seen as normal, and it's probably not something that any AAA games will try to change. Be them right or wrong on that choice.
I was in the exact same boat as you, I had two (very positive!) interviews with the SM and ASM at one location, then never heard back after two weeks. Called back a few times to find I wasn't needed there anymore, but that they'd send my info to another place. So I wound up having a third interview there, and they actually had their stuff in order (although they're busier by the numbers) and I was formally hired within about a week.
 it's almost certainly not you, and more likely that they *are* super busy and from the sounds of it, perhaps a bit disorganised. I would sit tight if I were you, and if you want to call back, maybe call on Wednesday (if you know when in the day they are least busy and the manager is present, try and call then?)

I think the article is well written, but is getting a little judgmental to conclude that because there was an accident, obviously flights should have been cancelled/diverted.  Just because you are wet doesn't mean you shouldn't have been outside in the rain.  You might have your umbrella but it fails, your boots start to leak.....something.  Commercial air travel is designed to deal w/ adverse conditions: planes w/ systems that can shoot approaches all the way to the runway, deicing equipment, etc.  I was in Denver last week during a massive snowstorm.  Planes taxiing on tarmacs that we absolutely covered in ice and snow - couldn't even see the cement.  But, Denver, like New York, is used to working in these conditions to keep flights moving.  It has been reported that the two planes that landed on that runway prior to this guy both reported good braking conditions, and I can tell you from working at a lot of airports that the ground crew makes regular runs down the runway to check for foreign debris, ice, runway condition, etc.  Stuff like this is the reason high perf runways are grooved and crowned.  But does all that mean that once in a while a few of the 1,632 things that have to happen just right for an airliner to land safely in any kind of IMC might go wrong and an accident happen?  Of course not, but it doesn't necessarily mean the decision making process was flawed either.
- commercial air travel is always going to aggressively try to continue to operate, and on that edge, once in a while, accidents are going to happen.
The article seems pretty accurate about how weather impacts a particular flight. But I don't buy his premise that this crash "is exactly why airlines cancel flights for snow." Airlines rarely cancel flights because a particular airport is being deluged with snow. There is the rare "Boston's in a blizzard, airport closure," but usually airports in cold climates are prepared for snow removal. I'm based at Chicago O'Hare, and they have a huge fleet of snow plows and removal equipment ready for the next storm. They are usually able to keep up until true blizzard conditions hit. 
That being said, when there is moderate to heavy snow the airport must continually clear the runways, which means they have to close one or two at a time for plowing, thus reducing the number of runways for operations. When this happens the flow of inbound and outbound traffic slows in number of arrival/departures per hour, and flights start getting delayed. Add to this the fact that departing aircraft are requiring deicing service, further delaying each departure by 15-25 minutes each.
The airlines have built their schedules around the airport’s optimal departure/arrival rate. When this rate decreases during a snow storm and flights begin incurring significant delays an airline’s flight schedule at other airports begins to be impacted because these delayed inbound aircraft are not available to continue on to the next destination. And then the problem begins to snowball, no pun intended. At some point the airline, in conjunction with FAA air traffic managers, decides to cut their losses and start cancelling flights and juggling the remaining flight schedule (a Herculean task when a hub is affected.)
 The most common reason for flight cancellations is that the airline and airport can’t keep up the scheduled pace of operations in the snow. 

You have some valid points. But like others have mentioned your argument of "twitch should make it's own software, like OBS, because OBS will die" is bad. If anything twitch should actively attempt to engage with such communities and guide them or even help them. OBS is an open source community on Github and they're rewriting their software to be multi-platform available on  the issue is the number of people contributing is limited and it could be so much faster with more  skilled people, it would especially be good if somebody from twitch helped as that would possibly enable to program to handle handshakes with twitch servers to be handled better i.e. better quality/connections.
Now the rest I'm not exactly sure, I mean regarding this so called DJWheat dude. But I totally agree with the API, the API is fucking ridiculous.. I tried making my own twitch bot and am actively working on it on github (private) however I just couldn't figure out how to do a simple 'uptime' command, until I found out that one would have to query the system and check for multiple places to see if it's online or offline ( That could be handled so much easier.. and it was previously. In one of the previous versions there was an "up_time" variable that could be queried and it would return something, iforgets what.
HTML5 they said they'd work on but it would be a long one. If anything they need to work on more ingest servers.. I'm streaming from Canada and it's just been horrible, why does the EU get several ones our Chicago one is removed and Canada gets nothing?
Overall yes there are issues, yes they can be handled better and more efficiently, yes the entire thing needs to be recoded because my total views haven't updated for the past 4 days and I've streamed 2 of those and have +20 new visitors so that's at least +20 views. Also it's unacceptable that the follower count on some other ppls stream is 0 at some point, like the only reason that is allowed to happen is if during load-time the server was unable to reach the database and retrieve the value but a simple refresh should fix it. Or if they're caching the follower count which also makes sense, then if(LastCount &gt; Now) {echo LastCount} else {echo Now} and not 0 where Now would store the possibly failed value being 0.
Heck twitchcon is even a terrible idea, too much money will be invested in that stuff.. I was hoping more ingest servers, better infrastructure just general backbone upgrades and not a stupid con that costs tons to build, facilitate, and manage.
Fuck they need to fix the chat feature even more than do anything else.. it's horrible.
 You have valid points, not all are spot on but you're going the right direction.
You're talking about fluff. The important API features are already there. Oauth with IRC opens the door for endless creativity. What is it that you think needs to be needed? Is it the same thing I want or what a partner wants? The problem I see with a lot of streamers that come on this subreddit is that they are looking for chat bots, flashy follower notifications, donation trackers, and other ‘features’ that they think is going to make their stream successful. What they need to be doing is streaming consistently and showing off their personality. I’m not saying there is nothing to be improved or added. It’s just a low priority and I hope it stays that way. 
I have never once visited a team site that provides anything extra to my Twitch viewing experience. Nor have I been compelled to subscribe to someone so I can get access to a team site. It’s nothing but fluff. Some may find it nice but my guess is that the large majority of people subscribing will be doing so because the stream is entertaining.  
Twitch is as transparent about HTML5 as most publicly traded companies are during their quarterly earnings calls. It’s to be expected. It’s nice when the engineers throw some information our way but it’s naïve to expect regular updates. If that post you quoted is supposed to be a road map I hope you don’t navigate often.
 
*** Additional API features should be a low priority. HTML5 is coming, be patient. 
I own 2 corporations. An LLC, and a SUB S corp. 
Yes the tax laws favor corporations. I will attempt to explain.
A Sub S corp is a flow through entity. S crops do not pay taxes. My corporation provides me and my wife wife each a company car. We have to calculate our personal mileage an pay taxes on it. No big deal. The rest of the expenses including gas and maintenance are paid for by my company. When I purchased my company from the previous owner we did a private financing deal. I take distribution from the company to make the payments, I get to write off the interest. I pay tax on the principal. Remember this washes through to my personal tax return.
S corp rules I have to take an appropriate wage and pay social security, state, local, and federal taxes on it.  I do that. My LLC operates as a holding company for the real estate my business operates in. So I basically rent space to myself.  Why would I do this?  The LLC rental income is not subject to social security tax.
According to GAAP/IRS we can utilize deprecation on the building and the fixed assets of the s corp. This reduces the income that flows through to my personal return.
For my final act, my S Corp has ~10 FTE's. I offer SHOP health insurance, so my business get a tax credit.

You might remember that an S corp doesn't pay taxes - so where does the tax credit go?  Answer: it flows through on my K1 to my personal return.  What does this mean?
On $220K of income in 2014, using all maximizing all deductions and credits, I not only had a $0 federal tax obligation for the entire Year, I have a $1K tax credit carryover for 2015. 
None of these benefits are available on W2 income.
 Rich people wrote the tax rules, most people don't understand how any of this works. Profits &gt; wages.
The Hornets have a pretty ideal schedule for the rest of the season as Mo Williams is really carrying them at the point position -- which has been their struggle without Walker.  If Jefferson can stay healthy and players like Zeller and Henderson play consistently and do their part, they should take a seed.
The Heat definitely have the most favorable schedule.  If they can manage to take down the Nets, Celtics, and those small market teams, then they can afford to lose a game or two to the Cavs or the Blazers finishing off the season strong. 
Indiana is hot no doubt, but they have a real rough stretch coming up.  Unless coaches decide to sit players closer to the playoffs I don't see them winning over 50% of the remaining games.  Paul George will most likely only be fired up if they make the playoffs.  No knock on the team at all, but West and Hibbert's inconsistency may lose them the race. 
The Nets can't hit a game winning shot for their lives (with the exception of Jack's the other night) and don't win games in overtime and when they count.  And I feel like the Jackson trade actually made the Pistons worse.  Thought they really had a good thing going with Augustine.  Their schedule isn't too awful and they are healthy.  May be the dark horse in the race but being bottom 4 in the East at this point I really can't get behind them. 
 Charlotte and Miami 
I am currently working on several SketchUp models of the various spacecraft in my world:
- [Nuclear powered surface-to-orbit shuttle](
- [Experimental FTL drive](
- [Vast, ancient, interstellar worldship](
Other models that have since been retconned can be seen in [this post]( 
Okay, let's look at it logically.
2D: A mentally and physically worn down young man who has had the piss beaten out of him by Murdoc almost constantly. He got kidnapped for the Plastic Beach record and just wants to no longer be part of Gorillaz in general.

Yet people ship him with Murdoc.

Noodle: She's often shipped with 2D. however Noodle and 2D relationship is more of a brother-sister thing, not in anyways a sexual or physical relationship (infact, Noodle and anyone from the band have a brother-sister relationship, although in Russel's case, it's more father-daughter).

Murdoc: a person who encompasses everything wrong in humanity and yet shippers force sexual connotations with him and 2D just "for shipping becuz tehry sooo cute!!!!&lt;3"

I mean, sure, there has been hints that Murdoc and 2D have had sex before, but if those hints are to be believed, that implies Murdoc basically raped 2D.

Russel: I haven't seen Russel being shipped with anyone but Noodle. And the only thing I can say about that is: No, stop, please, no.

 shipping Gorillaz characters is not a good idea at all.
I agree with the banning of gamergate at this point. I like the idea of debating these hard-hitting issues and keeping integrity in gaming "journalism," but it really has no place in /r/games at all.

People are pumping it up into a "hurr dont silence us we r anonymoose" bullshit and don't even realize the level of toxicity it brings to the community when they bring that bullshit into all of it.

- i agree with gg ban. everyone is still butthurt.
I recommend you do whatever YOU believe will bring you the most happiness and enjoyment.
**tldr**: think for yourself
I'm you ten years later. I have three suggestions, which I think help to varying extents, though I still struggle to have trust in my own sense of judgement.
1. Push back. The world is full of people with opinions, but that's all they are. Most men who suffer from this give a lot of weight to other's opinions, even above their own opinion. Practice doing little things that you feel good about but that someone else doesn't like. This helps develop that inner sense of knowing that you are a good person and acting with integrity even if someone else thinks you are being a jerk.
2. Work on the self-love piece. I know this is hokey and cliche, but ask yourself why you aren't more gentle with yourself, more caring. Why so critical? Why don't you treat yourself with more compassion? You're doing just as well as some, better than others. Everyone has room for improvement. Developing that sense of compassion about yourself and your own struggles will help.
3. Go somewhere where you are alone. Spend some time, and get a sense for what your choice is. You will want to revisit it when you get back in touch with other people, but try not to, because that answer you arrived at when alone is probably the right one.
If you're like me, you know what the right choice for you is, but you're worried about what other people will think of you if you make that choice. You worry about what they think about the choice you made. You can too easily see their perspective, and that makes you feel confused and unsure.
*** - (1) push back against the opinionated world, (2) have compassion for yourself, (3) listen to your answer when you spend some time alone, because that's probably the answer you are looking for.
I'm thinking ".338 lapua mag is too expensive, let's go with something cheaper and TIKKA T3". 
If I had serious money I'd go AI .338 Lapua or MacMillan or Surgeon... But I think I'd settle for .308 if I have low budget or .300 win mag or something like that. I'd like to be able to hunt with it as well haha. I'll be that guy that bring a target rifle to the hunting trip... with the 1500$ military scope. I talked to my mom's cousin (who's been hunting all his life) about glass bedding, target turrets and First focal plane VS Second Focal Plane... And rifle harmony... He had no idea what I was talking about lol
Tikka T3 for budget quality.
That's just what I've been doing tho. Basically there isn't really a way to 'theorycraft' how stuff is going to happen. You can study all the top games and practice all the tech but the fact of the matter is you gotta play vs. some people (preferably people better than you) get stomped and learn. Once you do that it gets a bit easier, I think people are a lot more receptive to giving contructive criticism once they see you have decent fundamentals. 
I can't speak for everyone but I don't really want to get super detailed in helping someone who lost and probably wont come back because it's wasted time. The more people you play and the more tournaments you go to the more help you will get from people who see that you are trying to improve.
Keep on teching, play people, get better.
I may have left out that the umayyadds control all of Spain and a majority of western France. Charlemanges legacy lasted maybe two generations. Now the biggest players in the Catholic realm are Bavaria and Lombard both to the South. Bohemia is my ally and equal in terms of size and military strength and fully embraced the new ways with me. I've personally pushed The germanic faith off central Europe and no other faith has had any luck reforming. 
 the catholics are down for the count 
We had an Amazon long ago, and we had one cat that liked to fuck with him from the top of his cage when we weren't looking. He'd coexisted with cats for nearly a decade without issue, so it was a new phenomenon.  Most of the time, she'd just bat at the cage to scare him.  He was pretty chill, so he never retaliated, instead choosing to scurry off to the other side of the cage until the cat was done doing whatever her tiny mammalian brain thought it needed to do.  Once we caught on, we started shooing the cat away, and after awhile her prey drive apparently subsided.
After maybe a year of peace, the cat started to sit on top of his cage again.  Not to bat at the cage like she did previously, just to taunt him. As if to say "I could eat you, motherfucker. But I'm not going to, because I don't *want* to." We'd shoo her off, but she'd hop up again after a few hours, and the cycle would repeat.  The parrot became increasingly agitated, to the point where we considered moving him to quiet room with a door.
It never got that far.  On this fateful day, she sat atop his cage, drooping her tail over the edge, lazily swaying it back and forth just out of reach.  She had become content with his prior refusal to retaliate, and she was making sure he knew who was boss.
What she didn't count on was that this motherfucker was made of pure contempt by this point, and had already decided he wasn't taking her shit anymore.  The instant her tail slipped between the bars, he reached out and grabbed a mouthful.  By this time, everyone in a one mile radius was acutely aware that a cat was most likely being run through a meat grinder asshole-first.
Large parrots possess incredible strength in their jaws, so breaking a bone isn't difficult by any stretch.  He let go as soon as *Butthole Meat Grinder Sonata #9* began, but the damage was already done: the last inch of her tail was broken, and was at a 90 degree angle to the rest of her tail.  
The vet considered amputation, but ultimately decided it would heal on its own.  It did heal, and there was never an indication that it bothered her, but it was crooked for the rest of her life.  A painful reminder that the food chain wasn't as linear as she once thought.
She was the last cat to get within 10 feet of that bird.

I'm curious about this too.  I was dating a guy that I really liked but he broke up with me. His work changed and he started a job where he is working 100 hours a week. He recently got back in touch and said that he's been missing me and would like to give it another try when his work situation calms back down.  That won't be until June.  I really liked this guy and was so sad when he ended things.  Now that I understand the kind of pressure he is under at work I wouldn't mind giving it another go in June if he is still interested then.  
The biggest problem is that I've been seeing someone else.  He's sweet and fun but I don't have any passionate feeling toward him.  I Don't know what the future holds, but if my ex asked me back today I would dump my new guy in a hot minute to be with him.  But in 3 months that might change in any number of ways.  
- No idea, but any insightful information would be welcome. 
&gt;  If Malaysia has one of the highest rainfalls in the world, where is the water going?
Firstly, although Malaysia has one of the highest rainfalls in the world, it also has a dry season that takes place more or less over the summer months.  During this time, rainfall is much lower than average.
Secondly, the major area wuth with water supply problems is the Klang Valley conurbation, which is hands-down the most densely and heavily populated area of Malaysia.  Simply put, there are a lot of people and industries there that require a lot of water.
Anyway, the major reasons for non-retention of water in the catchment areas in the Klang Valley are as follows:
**High impermeable surface area**  
Since the Klang Valley is very densely developed, this means that there are a lot of surfaces - roofs, concrete aprons, road pavements, etc. - where rainfall runoff cannot seep into the water table.  All this runoff mostly goes into stormwater drains that ultimately discharge into the river system, and since most if not all the river water intake points are located upstream of the developed areas, all this water basically goes out to sea unused.
**Limited rainfall catchment areas**
Because the river water intake points are located upstream, rainfall is largely useless for the purposes of providing treated water unless it takes place in those upstream catchment areas.  There has also been some encroachment of development into these catchment areas because highland properties are seen in the Klang Valley as upscale and desirable due to being away from the hustle and bustle of the city, so that doesn't help either.
In short, the high amount of rainfall is falling in the wrong places.
&gt; Why can't you just dig wells, instead of only using natural reservoirs?
I'm not sure, but it might be due to geology.  Most of the Klang Valley sits on what is essentially a limestone outcrop.  Taking away too much groundwater too quickly might mean the limestone becomes too brittle to support the weight of the soil and building above it, leading to sinkholes.
&gt; Is Selangor providing water to Putrajaya?
Yes, because Putrajaya is a Federal Territory located within Selangor's borders.
&gt;  Is that what the article is about?
No.  The article is about Selangor's new Menteri Besar revoking a previously signed agreement with the Federal government signed by his predecessor.  The agreement, in general terms, was that the Federal government would offset the cost of the state government's nationalization of the state's four water concessionaires in return for providing the necessary approvals for a new water treatment plant in the state. 
Here, "Putrajaya" actually refers to the Federal government, in much the same sense as Americans would say "Washington".
&gt;  What happened to the Pahang pipeline?
The pipeline/tunnel is completed.  However, it needs a water treatment plant to process the supplied water.  That water treatment plant is the one that the state government was supposed to issue approvals for under the cancelled agreement.
Let's go a little deeper to explain why this has happened.
Part of the manifesto of the current state government when they took over two General Elections ago was to take the management of water within the state of Selangor out of federal and corporate hands and into state hands.  As part of this, they froze the original project for the Langat 2 water treatment plant, forcing the Federal government to take over ownership of the project so that it could proceed.  When submissions were made to the state authorities for the construction of the project, the state government essentially placed a lot of stumbling blocks that prevented construction from actually beginning.
Following the water crisis in the Klang Valley in the summer of 2014, the then-Menteri Besar decided to work out a deal with the Federal government - the state would stop blocking the project if the Federal government stopped blocking the state's attempts at taking over the management of water supply from the concessionaires.  This deal was basically against the political line of the previous Menteri Besar's party, and later formed the argument for the ouster of that Menteri Besar, Now the current Menteri Besar is bringing the direction of the water supply issue in the state back in line.
 The real story behind this is basically politics.
As a liberatarian, I think 'Starve the Beast' is a great idea. But here's the thing- 
* Government should sell all assets at mkt price. It should not arm twist private players in paying higher price than what market would clear. An auction, especially reverse auction is a great price discovery method to find the right mkt price. 
* If you sell assets at prices lower than market price then private companies will not pass on the benefit to consumers, they will keep those profits for themselves. 
* Coal is a substitute for oil, coal private players would have just sold the energy slightly cheaper than oil per Kilojoule. Now they will sell at close to price of oil and maybe even close to expensive green sources. 
Tl ;dr - Coal players would have pocketed the gain since they compete with other energy player. Selling coal for as cheap as Sibal was saying by govt. taking a loss would mean we are putting a tax on green energy sources. 

Just picked up the game.  The demo is a bit confusing compared to the real thing.  For instance, in the demo you get crammed of information and you have no idea what you're doing but just kill this and that, unlike the real thing you get the "adventure" feel where you get to expolre things meet new monsters, find new plants, mine new ores there is a whole lot more than the demo.

- demo is a brief sample of the combat/quest system which is just a part of what makes MH a great game.

When I started playing like 8 months ago at the silver level (currently mg1). People would always say to save until the 4th round regardless of pistol victory/loss. They would even dispute the fact that you should buy after a win to maintain the advantage.

TF W+ TF E+ Lich Bane.
 His items were Rabadons Deathcap, Zhonyas Hourglass, Morellonomicon, Lich Bane, and Mejais (Likely 20 Stacks). 
This means the gold card had a base damage of 175%xTF's base AD, with 175 Base Damage (He's level 17, assuming E max 3rd), and a 155% AP scaling. 
Twisted Fate's base AD will be 102, giving him 102 Physical Damage, and 76 Magic Damage (Due to Lich Bane). TF's AP will be (assuming 21/X/X with all AP damage dealing masteries maxed out) 120+120+80+80+180+15+15+6 or 616, which multiplied by 1.43 is 880 AP. With a 155% AP Scaling, this equates to 1364 Damage. 
Twisted Fates Total Damage right now is 1440 Magic Damage and 102 Physical Damage. With Havoc, its is now 1483.2 Magic Damage and 102 Physical Damage. 
Yasuo has no MR (assuming he is not running MR runes), leading to him only having his 30 base MR. TF gets 28 effective MR on Yasuo after factoring masteries, and only 5 effective MR on Yasuo after factoring runes. That is basically 5% effective HP against TF's magic damage burst. Yasuo has 1416 HP (keep in mind Yasuo has taken some damage), with a 215 shield on passive. 
TF has insane AP Scalings on-hit, and as long as Yasuo had taken around 170 damage, Yasuo would have been one shot. If yasuo had gotten a Q off on Janna, and lifestealed, he wouldnt have died in one gold card. 
End justifies the means. Just like Hitler, who also was regularly on the history channel.
The history channel *is* Hitler.
Isn't it more likely that people say whatever it is they need to say to get on the good side of their current audience? I don't doubt Anita said she wasn't a gamer (I've heard her say it), I don't doubt Anita also said she was a gamer.. and that she hated gamers.
I don't Milo said he wasn't a gamer (I've seen him write it!), I don't doubt Milo said he was a gamer... and that he loves gamers. 
When you're in a position that relies on social media, you tend to say what you need to say to reach the audience. 
- They're probably both liars. 
Firstly;
&gt;Gamer**s**gate
You've been here for months and don't know there's no S in the term?
Second
&gt;Was GG made by assholes when it started
Arguable. The start of GG had serious overlap with the 'Quinnspiracy', in which many people went too far. The first month or so of Gamergate was marked as much by happenings, as it was by bad information and overemotional unfiltered, finally unleashed anger at the colluding hypocrites.
The reason for the bad rep is in those months, and it comes from a mixture of actual mistakes GG has made, the 3rd party trolls and the demonization that ignored reality and strove to defend any GG target regardless of wrongdoing. Many people against GG refuse to see how GG has changed since then. Many others do acknowledge GG has 'gotten less evil' over time, but still demand some sort of grand gesture to make up for that first month, ignoring that the vast majority of GG got involved *after* that. 
TLDR The bad rep of GG is partly deserved but hugely inflated. Probably about 20% fair bad reputation, 80% inflated and made up.
La plupart des mes opinions sur r/quebec sont downvotees jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient cachées carrement. Je pense que le syndicalisme a changé de vocation dans les 20 ou 30 dernières années et ne constitue plus uniquement une force de changement positive. Il fait plutot obstacle au changement. Je ne pourrais pas me trouver plus loin du hivemind de r/quebec.

&gt;Je pense parfois à changer d'emploi mais à quel prix?
Regarde jusqu'à ce que tu trouves plus intéressant ailleurs et quittes de façon civilisée. Ta job c'est pas ta blonde t'es remplaçable pour ton employeur autant que ton employeur devrait être remplaçable pour toi. Je donne des conférences à des jeunes dans les millieux défavorisés et je leur démontre que même avec un train de vie modeste, un revenu décent ça prend quand même 3 à 6 mois d'autonomie dans ton compte de banque pour vivre confortablement et de façon libre et autonome. 3 à 6 mois c'est assez pour .. perdre ta job, ta blonde, tomber en dépression, planter ton char, et revirer tout ça de bord. 
Just saying, je suis très fervant de la responsabilité, de l'autonomie et la liberté individuelle. Aucune job sur cette terre va valloir mon bonheur ou ma santé. Et si l'endroit où je suis m'offre des conditions médiocres, c'est à moi de ne pas être une femme battue et changer les choses pour le mieux.

&gt;I don't care how much schools charge, students who don't work hard, do the assignment, and come to class prepared to engage with the material on a meaningful level deserve to fail and forfeit however much they paid as a result.
I care how much PUBLIC SCHOOLS cost and so should you. These schools now cost so much money that the average person cannot afford to go to one without putting themselves in years of debt from $50,000+ in student loans. Students are taking a risk by accepting the loans and they aren't even guaranteed to get a job that pays enough to pay off their student loan in any reasonable amount of time. 
when college tuition gets to a certain amount then the cost benefit for the average person is not there. 
While keeping up with an ex you still like over the phone, txt, or e-mail sometimes works, seeing each other in person is never a good idea.  It is not for the reason you think however, the main reason it does not work is that it is accomplishing the exact opposite of what you want.  You want to keep dating her, but she does not.  By staying with her you don't really show her what she is missing and she can drag this out until she is emotionally settled on someone else.  When you make a clean break, walk away and start dating other people it has the added benefit of showing that person your value as a person.  You will also enjoy dating other people whether you believe it now or not.  
If you want to have any chance with this girl you need to walk away as quickly as possible and move on with your life.  If you are lucky she will miss you and want you back once you have moved on, but it's probably too late for that.  If you find someone else you might not want to get back with her anyway, and she probably already looks down on you because you stuck around instead of walking away.  When you don't make that clean break it creates an unequal power relationship which will change how the other person sees you.  Source:  I took this advise years ago and have been happily married for 3 and a half years to the girl that broke it off with me.  Immediately moved on with my life and started dating again, we kept in touch and when we both realized what we left behind it was much easier to start over. Been together 9 years in total and 7 since the breakup.  Sticking around actually accomplishes the exact opposite of what you want.
&gt; I mostly know what I'm doing that's NOT working, but I'd like ideas on what I SHOULD be doing. (i.e. I dash attack too much but what should I replace it with?) I know boost grab is something I need to be able to perform more consistently but what else? I really feel like my neutral game leaves a lot to be desired. How can I deal with DD camping? Just needle camping? Should I strictly be forcing approaches instead of approaching myself?

I think at this point you can't really just look at the game as a series of options that you use or don't use. Your movement where it's at right now simply doesn't give you many options. Sheik has a pretty short dash length, so whenever you run i've noticed you pick one of 4 options: dash attack/boost grab/jump/roll which becomes very linear and predictable. If you work on anything, work on your movement. For example if you learn how to wavedash you can wavedash back from your dash, which can open up your tilt game. So before you get into the technicalities, you can do a bunch of movement drills. Start with learning how to wavedash back, then wavedash out of shield. Learn to shffl if you haven't already(you play pm so I assume you can do this). Then you can mix it up. Try to dash forward, wavedash back and dash forward again. Watch videos of sheik players and learn how to combine your dashes and wavedashes to improve your movement game.

&gt; I believe my bonus is taxed at a higher rate. 
Generally speaking, no. At the end of the day, it's usually all ordinary income.
&gt; Would it make sense to increase my contributions for my bonus pay period and then change it afterwards?
Not really. If you are financially doing well, then you should look into maximizing your 401k at $18,000 for the year. 15% contribution should be able to do that before the end of the year with your projected 22% bonus income. You will also easily get the match for both salary and bonus at 15%.
*** - don't change anything.
This is why we have a gator hunting season in Florida. They grow too big, too ballsy and too many in numbers. So, once a year for 3 months after the eggs hatch and it starts getting cold you can go out and take 2 alligators per tag.
In order to get a tag you have to enter a lotto. I think it was roughly $300 to enter. If you get chosen they'll charge you the money and send you two tags.
After that you get into the hunt, skinning, mounting and eating them but I'm on mobile so I'm not go there.
That's why we kill alligators in Florida.
From what little I've tried on my Sorc with a geared tank pet (treek), xp rate is significantly slower than dps/healing or dps/dps combos.  
However, and this is a big caveat, I could also take on champion-level mobs with relative ease where I would struggle in the DPS spec.  It's a battle of attrition, but you've got the advantage and just whittle them down until death.
TL/DR:
Disadvantage in XP rate
Advantage in big game hunting
So sad. I can't imagine this happening to me. I have a friend who lost their dog after taking it to a Banfield Clinic in a PetSmart for a teeth cleaning. They came to pick him up but we're told he had died during the cleaning. They later received an anonymous email from one of the employees saying that the "anesthesiologist" who administered the anesthesia had no formal training and had given the dog too much so it never woke up. For a fucking teeth cleaning... Breaks my heart. 
Another Banfield/PetSmart story... My boxer got a MRSA infection in his toe after having leg surgery for a broken leg (he had nerve damage, which caused him to knuckle, which led to a toe injury that got infected, long story). He had been being treated by an actual vet but we had recently moved away and I decided to take him to Banfield to have his toe looked at. After weeks (and more than $1,000 in medication), the infection was only getting worse. Banfield told me they needed to amputate his leg. At this point, my wife and I took him back to his regular vet in our hometown for a second opinion. They told me that the medication they had prescribed at Banfield was "not even close" to the treatment for MRSA. As a result, the infection had spread. He didn't end up needing a leg amputation, but we did have to amputate his toe, which would have been completely unnecessary if we'd been prescribed the correct medication to begin with. I realize how lucky we got to only lose a toe when I hear other stories of how bad PetSmart/Banfield is. 
.. Never take your pet to a PetSmart. NEVER. 
This is heartbreaking. 
I took my dog to Petsmart twice when he was just a pup. The second time, we were told that he was so horrible with the staff, they needed several people to try to control him. He was 6 months, less than 10 pounds, and never ever put up a fight when I groomed him. He was terrified of groomers for a long time, to the point that he would shake uncontrollably whenever we took him anywhere. He was always afraid we were going to the groomer again. It's been years and I finally found a groomer he's not terrified of. 
- Petsmart is awful, don't take your pets there 
Seriously.
Last week we took my Miniature Schauzer in to the pet hospital they have in some Petsmart in the morning because he kept throwing up, and told us to come pick him up around 4 - it just seemed like a routine tummyache. We'd taken him there dozens of times when things like this happened.
They called us at about 1 saying that nothing they did was helping and he just kept getting worse the longer he was there, and they were worried that he'd die before we came to pick him up and wanted us to get there in time to say our goodbyes. They set us up in a private room, and about 10 minutes after we got there he was gone.
He was 14, which is at the high end of the spectrum for that breed, but the people who worked there were just so kind and accommodating for us, they didn't rush us out of the room, they gave us plenty of time to grieve, and when we just went to pick up his ashes today they had all signed a card for us, since we had always taken him there and they all knew him.
- Don't lump in the shitheads at one location to all their locations. Some of them are just the best people ever.
I was taking my dog to Petco for this exact reason, but she still got mistreated terribly a little over a week ago. The groomer kept her caged for over three hours in the back while she took care of the "more important" customers. There was no warning when I brought her in for her appointment, and it's on her file that she already has anxiety issues because she was rescued from a bad home. When she finally got to my dog (which just so happened to be when I was tired of walking and was sitting in my car outside), she just dipped her in water, shredded her nails, and gave her back wet with a ribbon tied far too tight around her neck. 
Short haired dog, under 20lbs. She was anxious and upset for the rest of the day, and I had to fix the absolute disaster the "groomer" managed to create. All we needed was a bath and nail clipping, something that normally takes less than half an hour total. 
Called corporate TWICE because the manager refused to call me back about it. Went to the store, and apparently they have employees that pretend to be the manager and have no problem telling a weekly customer (with grooming every few months) that they don't want my business. Manager finally called me back and said that she supported the groomer's decision and that my dog isn't welcome back, but she would happily return my money.
Not to mention she made sure to let me know that the previous groomer, who my dog loved and we never had a problem with, was fired for "wasting resources" (aka, giving anxious dogs a squirt of calming spray and taking the time to make sure nails were done properly).
 Windows don't mean shit unless you sit there the entire time, and even then the groomer might not give a fuck. 
I worked for Petsmart a year ago. I was a dog bather. The "training" they had us do was all computer based. It took only 2-3 hours to get through all the material. Then they just throw you in with the groomers with no real hands on training. In the 8 months I worked there (yes, ONLY 8), I saw some terrible things happen to some great dogs. One of the groomers who had worked there for 4 years had an 8 week old puppy in the back and was blowdrying it. The puppy was terrified of the blowdryer and was so scared that it hung itself on the lead attached to the table. Luckily, it was okay. I didn't work there much longer after that. I have plenty of other horror stories from working there. PetSmart will never get my business ever again.

I am lvling an account on LAN. I had saved up 6800ish ip and it got me almost a full set of runes. You will want at least a standard ad/ap rune page as they really help for early trades and csing.
You can get flat/scaling mr blues and either health or armor yellows and use for both pages, magic pen reds for ap and physical damage reds for ad. Ap quints and ad or attack speed quints. 
I'm sure someone has done the math on the ip you would need to get a complete set. 
Tldr I suggest runes first.
Hi, here are my thoughts on the issue--whether or not anyone cares. I honestly don't care if people promote their content or not. However, if a member of the community is just spamming their links hoping for views, subs, and donations--that's obnoxious. The rules were created since the beginning in that there is no self-promotion.

The reason why self-promotion was limited in the first place was probably because this community used to be young and we didn't want all the posts on the subreddit to be: "Hey, watch my stream. Please Favorite, Like, Sub, Donate. I will rare summon on stream thanks to your donations. Shout outs to xxasianxbabygirlxx for the sub." This is nonsense. Now that we have a much larger and hopefully mature community, it may be worth reviewing this rule if the community wants it.
Self-promoting for non-website and non-moderators is okay from what I understand.

 Don't just spam out your links, and don't blindly upvote your own content or ask anyone else to!
Why? Because reddit is a community, not a platform for self-promotion.
edit:changed non-moderations to non-moderators because I can't brain.
So the Molex website has an incredibly useful feature: they'll tell you what part numbers mate with what.  
So plugging in (pun intended) your male PCB mount connector, I found the appropriate mating female connector.  Going from that female connector, I found the male mating parts, and the crimp terminals are linked here.  [LINK](  You'll want to pick the third or fourth option, depending on the gauge of wire you're using.  
To find the housing for them, click on the part number of the male pins you're getting, then under "use with" they give you the part numbers of the housing, which is here.  [LINK](
Looking at them, I don't think they're a direct match, since they're two different series.  The molex website says they're compatible, and the pitch between connectors matches, so I think it should work out for you.  
  Use [these crimp terminals]( with [this housing]( and you should be good to go.
If you were right, then autoclicking wouldn't be as popular as it is. Why is it more effective to click fast, if clicking 5 times per second would be good enough?
You are right in some ways, if you click 5 times per second or 10, you'll do the same damage to an entity, but a player isn't a zombie and works different, even though they are both entities.
Do a test, try clicking 5 times per second and look how much knockback someone gets, and then do make an macro so you can click 15 times per second. Me, and others have tested this before - you get more knockback and it's way easier to hit people while being in a combo. If autoclicking, or clicking fast at all didn't give an advantage it wouldn't be this popular.

Why are there people that doubleclick? Why is that even against the rules if it doesn't give you an advantage? You are clicking, so your aim won't be as good as if you were not clicking, clicking (over) 5 times per second is extremely easy and almost anyone can do it with no to little practice. But if you use a double click macro and click 10 times per second instead of 5 - you randomly start doing better in fights, while actually nothing has changed following your logic. 
Why do you give more knockback if you click fast, why is it easier to hit people if you click fast, why do people complain so much if it's not an issue at all? Why is autoclicking against the rules if it barely gives an advantage, yes you might get better aim if you don't have to click, but with a little practice your aim barely even changes if you click (unless if you jitter, but jitterclicking is useless to then)
You won't do more damage if you click 100 times per second or 5, but it gives more knockback, you will get the next hit even if you are the person getting combo'd, fast clicking can give a huge advantage over people that click only 5 times per second.
&gt; Autoclicking doesn't do much in a fight.
If I would be autoclicking, let's say 20 clicks per second, I would litterally combo you up in the air and you would not be able to do anything about it if you would be clicking 5 times per second. 
But if we would both be clicking 5 times per second, the knockback you get will be similar and is based off ping instead, and knockback is extremely important in fights these days; the more knockback you give, you bigger the chances are you will win.
Because of ToggleSprint, you  are able to combo and sprint and the same time without having to tab your W-key. Which means, if you give a lot of knockback you can still sprint towards them and keep hitting them until they jump and receive enough knockback to be out of your reach. They also can't hit you because on their screen they will be out of your reach because of the knockback; which is called a combo.

&gt; Minecraft does not register anything over 5 cps so all of the other clicks mean nothing.
I probably said it at least 5 times, but I'm gonna say it again - the clicks mean a lot, but you won't take extra damage. If you would, no one would play it anymore. 
You indirectly do take extra damage, because as I said earlier, fast clicking and/or autoclicking gives you the advantage in a fight, if you get somebody in a combo (which will be easy if you click fast) you will be hitting them a lot more than they *can* hit you, which results them indirectly taking more damage, and losing the fight. 
I probably repeated myself multiple times, but I'm trying to make clear that, yes, fast clicking **DOES** matter. And it's useful, not useless. I rushed this wall of text, so if you still disagree I can take my time to proof that I'm right in this one.

*** In short, you're right. If you click 100 times per second or 5, you will do the same damage, but it helps you in fights a lot because it's easier to hit people first, makes up for missed hits and you give more knockback which results you in being "better" than others and winning more fights.

lol
Here's the thing about make up: Yes, you look "prettier" with it. But, people get used to seeing you that way, and if they see you without it, you look strange to them. You should go a week without any make up. You are the same person either way. 
Also, if you always wear make up, there will be no difference if you are going out and want to look nice... You will look the same as every day. Honestly, I'm 34 and only wear make up for special occasions. That makes people think and say "wow you look great". Whereas, if I looked like that every day, there would be no wow moment, or any difference at all. 
Another thing is that guys don't give a shit about make up. They don't notice it or care. Until, they get used to seeing you with it. Then if they see you without it, something will be off about the way you look, and not in a good way. Ask any guy and he'll tell you something that took me years to notice: some of the hottest and sexiest looking females I've ever seen were wearing no make up, t shirt, jeans and a ponytail. If you present yourself in a way that makes people appreciate your natural beauty, the occasional make up will be a step up. Wearing make up all the time, makes your natural beauty (which is obvious in the no make up shot) a step down. 
 No make up. Be yourself. 

Legs for sure. I used to play a rail walker in my early days of T10 and even when I got level 100. Keep in mind that this was before the rail buff from DOTM, so I have plenty of railing experience :) Although legs are definitely not the best movement type in the game, they're best for rails because they can get virtually everywhere and stay still when you stop. Wheels and tank treads slide a little now, but they do stay relatively still. However, they are much more prone to tesla attacks which rails have very little defense against. Hovers wobble too much and Fliers are out of the question, so the only other alternative is a sled. I have recently gotten a lot into sleds, and it takes a little getting used to. A proper sled can get anywhere on the map go faster than anything else on your team except UWDd or thruster sticks, and cling to walls. The only problem is that rails are so big that it requires a big bot, and sleds should be nimble and lightweight so they can climb up everything and go fast. 
**I would recommend legs, but anything except hovers and fliers would work. It depends on your ideal play style. Hope his helps :)**
Our teamplay can be better, won't change the fact that they can just straight up outskill my five without needing any teamplay at all, which proves my point of they do nothing special?
Their teamplay is trash compared to most good european teams, sorry to say, they can just outskill certain teams, but they will never beat fnatic or NIP at their current stages simply because they are matched, if not bested at a skill standpoint, and completely trumped at a teamplay standpoint.
They do nothing special, thanks for responding.
I hate that this myth is so pervasive and persistent in our culture. Exercise doesn't magically negate the effects of poisoning your body. You might look healthy on the outside, but you are still killing yourself. Most people understand that you can't just exercise to counteract the effects of smoking. No one would say, "You just consumed arsenic? You better go for a run!" Why do people, then, think it is different when it comes to alcohol and crappy food?
 that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
I just gave up drinking coke 5 weeks ago. I used to wake up every night with crippling acid reflux and I'd vomit acid like the little dinosaur that kills Newman in Jurassic Park. I've only done so once in the last 4 weeks.
- Coke turns you into [this guy](
The exception here is that we all CHOSE to pay the money for access to a game that we were VERY WELL informed was going to be in development for a long time and would be very broken at times. Just because your specific bug(s) haven't been magically fixed by the devs overnight gives you no right to berate them. They made the generous decision to offer us a chance to be involved in the development process by paying a reduced rate over the release cost. If you didn't want to be part of it, you could have waited until release and paid full retail. TL/DR: HTFU and deal with the consequences of your actions like an adult.
I'm not sure if this helps but here are my thoughts on this:  
Economy:  
Economy is a strange beast in this game (though it can be argued it's a strange beast in real life as well).  You have to keep an eye out on it daily as it fluctuates.  There's usually a known trend at the beginning of a new patch, but after is more like rolling dice.  What you were selling like hot cakes for two weeks grinds to a complete halt as some other thing is "all the rage".  Sound familiar to some real life events probably.  As a Weaver main, the reasons  items you sell will be bought are the same as before with one addition: vanity.  
Gear:  
I'd do a comparison of the current crafted crafting gear over the gear that can be bought from NPCs.  For example, the Ehcati Smithing Gloves is not that much different then a fully mended Artisan's Mitts if you're willing to take a hit of minus 3 CP.  Then there's the fact that Artisan's Spectacles is currently still the best head gear.  Take a look here from some ideas:  
  
Desynthesis:  
Desythesis is pretty important because quite a bit of the newer gear has the demimateria generated as part of their recipe but I wouldn't necessary consider the economy revolving around it (yet) though that might be server dependent.  
 Look at the Marketboard and see if you can make what's being sold.  
WoW is not diverse. You have PVP, which mostly dead last I played, and PVE. Which is regurgitating the same missions against different factions with slightly modified criteria and raids for end game that are mostly reptitive once the gimmick is discovered. Plus, they took out a lot of the build variety that made creating your build different and, truthfully, made it easier for noobs to not f*ck up a build.
I digress, if you think WoW is diverse, you are not seeing it, or you love WoW. The same can be said of people who like BT as much as you like WoW; however it is hypocritical to sit back and say one repetitive game is better than another. Especially when both cost similar money to play.
 His opinion is just as correct as yours, as they are subjective. However, you cannot quantify expensive as being $X and exclude other games because you feel it is justified. That is moving the goal posts.
I can only give you my $.02 here. I have a wife and three kiddos. I love Battletech and Mechwarrior and so does my son. 
Most people that game, especially on consoles routinely drop as much on a few $60 games every other month or every few months they may play for a few weeks and then drop or sell off. 
This is a game that is constantly being developed and at its core is really fun and scratches that 'mech itch I have as said BT/MW fan. I don't mind at all spending a hundo every 6 months or whatever. I don't currently subscribe to any other games so without MWO I'd be spending that on other crap to entertain myself anyway.
- you're going to spend $$$ on entertainment anyway. If you don't enjoy the game, spend your money on what you do enjoy.
See you on the battlefield o7
I attribute my mastering and enjoyment of both the locusts and the cicada chasis solely because of this reason.
Being a student, I have no way to buy any of these packs. I was veteren founder, and that;s the most I have ever given to this game. Of course I occasionally buy some MC during sales, thats about it. 
If your willing to just play and enjoy one or two chasis, grinding for modules to fully kit out all the variants is still good fun. The trial mechs are fine....but they're still trial mechs...
I'll save up and sometimes buy mechs outside my weight class just to try them, though that is limited as well to mechbays.
 If you cannot spend the big money, then you gotta tailor your experience to one or two mech types. Get to love them and you'll be fine.
&gt; Most people that game, especially on consoles routinely drop as much on a few $60 games every other month or every few months they may play for a few weeks and then drop or sell off.
You're walking into a very dark alley there my friend.
&gt; This is a game that is constantly being developed
Many are, this is no exception.
&gt; - you're going to spend $$$ on entertainment anyway.
So you have given up on reason.
&gt; See you on the battlefield o7
I hope so. IS for life! o7
No reason to hold off on using the yellow and flares.  Even the reds can be added in after only a small number of games.  
  
As for the rest:  
  
I rarely use technology cards, most people I've used them with never really seemed that interested, a little fiddly for what they bring to the game,so I only break them out for novelty with players who know the game inside-out.  
  
Reward deck, on the the other hand, is fantastic and really breathes life into defensive allying.  You can add it in after only a few games as well, practically no additional complexity from base.  
  
Hazards can make the game a *little* more stressful, so I only use them with relatively comfortable players and, even then, not always.  
  
Never played with the space stations, but I imagine they would be one of the last things to try.  
  
Don't forget about power and flare variants, as mentioned in the rulebook.  There is plenty of mileage to be had in the base game, what with hidden, rotating, &amp; double powers, as well as the freewheeling flares which is great fun if a little chaotic.  
  
***: get yellow aliens and flares going as soon as your second game, reds almost immediately after that, and then toy with tech and variants to see what appeals before moving on to expansions (starting with Cosmic Incursion).
In fairness, i'm playing in a few games where i'm the only one who remembers what happened a few sessions ago. Sometimes i have to remind **My DM(s)** what was going on and the plot hook(s) (s)he threw at us.
Some people just have a better memory then others, for my sessions i recommend to my players to get their notepads ready because if they forget it and ignore certain things, bad things will happen and i will TPK partys for forgetting information i hinted towards. It only took 2 TPK's before my players figured it out that writing down a few things will really help them massively. PS: This doesn't mean if i gave very small slight hints that i'll tpk a group for not picking up on it but if they actually forgot how certain npcs personalitys work or that they asked for information about a town that was being raided by &lt;insert something here&gt; that there will be reprocussions from such things if they don't deal with it.(Good or bad)
Another thing that really helps is; before the session starts let THEM do a recap of what happened the previous session.
Alternatively; Try a player diary approach, let each (litterate) pc keep a diary of their adventures in character form which i **KNOW** for a fact that if they do it, they'll actually remember whats metagame knowledge and what they know in character.
 I'm a bit harsher then most dm's when it comes to things like this but its because i put in the time to make the world come to life for them to live in, i answer their questions but if they ignore then information that they had access to, i will punish it because it annoys me.
Eight years ago my father found a wallet on the street with $6000 cash in it with cards and all. It belongs to a man in his mid 20s from the same lower socio-economic suburb of Australia like ourselves. My farther decided to return it with all its contents but after hearing the story behind this you will understand why he probably regrets it.
Upon looking at the mans ID and the circumstances in which the wallet was found i urged my father to keep the money as the man in my judgement was almost definitely a drug dealer and we needed the money.
My father being the good man that he is with a poor refugee background disagreed with me and said the man probably withdrew the money to buy furniture and had he lost his wallet he would want someone to return it as well.
My father then found the man's address and after confirming that it was in fact him on the ID my farther gave the man his wallet with the money at his house. The man after counting the money in front of my father pocketed the wallet then began aggressively threatening my farther and fuming at the mouth and threatened to call the police if my father doesn't leave the property immediately.
My father didn't even get thanked.
My father finds $6000 AUD, tries to return it, the owner he returned it to takes the wallet, doesn't thank my father but instead threatens my father. That is what being good gets you.
If you want to focus efforts, just go after the bugs, then the cyborgs, then the illuminate. 
That's the order they became available and they're even listed in the on-ship encyclopedia in the same order, so that's the logical progression to take them out. Anyone sensible enough to realize that efforts need to be focused, should be sensible enough to notice that pattern, which is the closest thing to an "official" priority list.
As more people get closer too unlocking all the stratagems, you'll probably see more focus, as less people will be distracted by going to other systems to score better gear.
 you know what's up, get the bugs and lets the braindead hordes go after whatever, they're too stupid to cooperate effectively anyway.
Funny. I've played CM exclusively since FIFA 10. Switched to FUT in FIFA 15. Playing against the CPU will never be the same.
The CPU is very predictable, even at the hardest dificulty. If you don't attack it, it doesn't try too hard to regain possession, even if it's losing like 3-0. If you cut every possible pass the CPU just holds possession until you free some space up for it to use and even then it's NEVER aggressive.
Winger gets a nice through ball and has the entire field for himself? No worries, the CPU stops right before the penalty area and turns, waits for you to come and reorganize your defense and then starts to furiously pass the ball.
Oh I forgot. The CPU almost never scores early on. It just casually misses crazy chances left and right, so you have time to get your shit together and start playing.

I don't know, the CPU is just largely pointless to play against.
----
**** played CM for years. CPU is really predictable and lenient if you are passive. Too boring once you realize the patterns and just annoying to play against.
G-d does actually maintain relationships with all non-Jewish national and people. One thing that is a core Jewish belief is that G-d has a part in the day to day world, every aspect of the world, and that He renews Creation at every moment. So this being true, it must reason that G-d also is influencing the world of all non-Jews.
G-d also maintains  a relationship on the individual level. Before the Jewish people existed there were also prophets and followers of G-d. Adam, non-Jew. Eve non-JEw. Noah, non-Jew. But both are considered to have been saintly and that they spoke with G-d directly.  Today still there are non-Jews that believe in our G-d, but are not considered Jewish. Some pray and study with us. They are called Noahides. They follow seven basic commandments given to the entire world. They are then expanded on. If your interested check out  So yea. G-d's involved. 
Tl:DR: G-d maintains a relationship with all non-Jewish people. Individually there are non-Jews called Noahides that follow our same G-d while following certain moral and ethical behavior. 
I jokingly refer to my painting as 'Paint by numbers', because in my mind it does feel like it at times and it is how I start my approach to painting models. How ever you are interpreting the phrase 'paint by numbers' as an inherantly negative connotation when it is simply a method of approach to painting. 'Painting by numbers' in it self is not a good or bad way to paint models or anything else for that matter. I have seen fantastic art created as a result of 'paint by numbers', there is nothing wrong with the approach, it all comes down to how much effort and creativity you add to the approach itself.
When I look at a model I assign aspects of it a colour in much the same way you would with a 'paint by numbers' image. For example "Armor plating will be white/beige, Robes will be red, any trim will be gold". Like any 'paint by numbers' picture, the detail is all there already in the physical model, I just have to apply the right colours to bring it to life. Once the base colours are filled in, it is really up to you how much extra effort you put in with other effects like drybrushing, washes, blending etc to make it really stand out, but it all stems from that starting point.
To someone starting out it is a good aproach to have and is a great foundation to start building upon. It wont imediately get you professional looking models, but it can yield some very good results and provide a base with which to experiment with until someone has the confidence to try more advanced techniques.
**TL:DR** Is painting minatures 'just like paint by numbers'? Yes it can be. Is this a bad thing? No, not at all and it should not be.
objectively it's either that or Average Canadian supports the bill.
You can't really just assume since there wasn't much of a response that everyone does/would agree with your point of view. 
Analogy time.  Let's say we have a country where 75% of the population supports keeping the owning of sharks illegal.  And the government passes a bill saying that they are going to keep owning sharks illegal.  0.2% of the population (that would be the same as 100,000 Canadians compared to their entire population) decides to protest this bill.  One of these Canadians is in support of this bill.  So he goes onto a website and says:
 &gt; Lackluster response to criminal bill: Average Canadian apathetic and uninformed at best.
Because he just assumes that if everyone was properly informed they would agree with him.  
 don't claim an entire nation is apathetic and uniformed because YOU didn't get a response YOU wanted.
It's, money, but not quite. Cryptocurrencies are kind of a money-commodity hybrid that allow free trade without governmental oversight or control. They foster a healthy and good black market outside of typically corrupt power structures.
Dogecoin is a bit different though. This is a crypto with a personality. It is a digitized, tradeable form of happiness. Its kind of an example of what it would be like if hugs and smiles were worth money. Seems somewhat naive, and potentially vulnerable, but the community is so bonded that it has a natural circle the.herd effect that has allowed it to survive some serious blows that would have collapsed any other group.
TL:DR: crypto is digital gold. Doge is digital gold combined with digital hugs.
I don't really believe in the concept of "the one." Upon finding someone "perfect" for me, I remain unconvinced that I would know, and I'm fairly sure I wouldn't be perfect for them. Worst of all, I've seen someone "perfect" for me turn into somebody completely different.
Tl:dr, I hope not.
Big Ben is better than both, and stats even show it. He has just as many rings as Eli, yet his TD/INT Ratio is better, he has a higher completion percentage, he's taken way less sacks and has more wins in the regular season. Big Ben has never really been known for his passing skills. He's always been deemed a hand it off, control the pace of the game and let the defense keep us in the game if need be. But when needed, he makes the drive successful and makes the throws necessary to do so, i.e. Super Bowl 43. I've always said I'd take Big Ben in crunch time over Peyton. Rivers deserves no recognition for HoF talk.
Eli needs to play lights out and inflate his stats for a few years or get another SB win before he should be considered. His play gives the perception that his SBs were luck, amazing supporting cast, or whatever counterargument you can provide. He's never had flashy numbers and he's always in the mix for league leader in interceptions thrown and turnovers. Im just not sold on Eli. I do admit his throw on the corner to Cruz (correct me if im wrong, I just vividly remember the throw) was money. Amazing throw. I give him props for that. But other than that throw, his career to me is iffy. In my eyes, that is the only thing he's done that ever mattered or had drastic ramifications. If he can get one more I say he gets in. Otherwise, he'll just get in because his name is "Manning."
 Big Ben, first ballot; Eli will get in because of his last name; Rivers deserves no consideration, yet.
I have wondered about this for years...what would really happen to the military if everything fell apart. I spent 12+ years as a Cav Scout (19D) in the Army. Deployed twice to Iraq, have been stationed in Germany, Korea, etc. Left as an E-6 after my last tour in Iraq.  To me, it seems to depend on the heart of the soldier, the moral sense of what is right, what type of unit they are in, and the mentality of others in their unit.  There are so many variables. If all hope seemed lost, how many would leave and return to their families? How much and what type of equipment would they have? Depending on how things went down, they might be a long ways from home. I have known many good soldiers, but there are also quite a few that I would never want to cross their path in a lawless world.  Counter423, keep a close team of like-minded people (ideally people in your squad), a rough plan that you all and your immediate families know, and you'll survive.
Bullet point version of the article:
* 2015’s House Bill 152 would require alcohol license holders to self-report any violations of local, state or federal alcohol laws, rules or regulations to the Georgia Department of Revenue within 45 days. It would also set a 45-day deadline for cities and counties to report any violations within their jurisdiction to the Department of Revenue. 
* Under current law, cities and counties are supposed to report violations to the department. The bill modernizes the language, requiring each local government to “adopt a policy and implement a process” for reporting.
        
* The new bill would allow the revenue commissioner to impose fines of up to $750 for license holders that fail to report violations. It does not specify a penalty for cities and counties.
* Bar is defined as a place that derives 75 percent or more of its revenue from alcoholic beverages.
* Under the city’s alcohol ordinance, Statesboro officially has no bars, only restaurants that serve alcohol. These are either “sports restaurants,” required only to have a food permit, or ordinary restaurants, required to derive more than 50 percent of their revenue from food sales — but with this reported to the city through an unaudited process.
        
* Putting the 75 percent rule in state law gives the Department of Revenue power over a distinct line between restaurants and bars. The department will be able to look at monthly sales tax reports, which already classify food and drink revenues separately.
* The bill does not limit the 21 minimum age for bouncers to those who work in bars as defined by the 75 percent rule. Instead, a bouncer is separately defined as “an individual primarily performing duties related to verifying age for admittance, security, maintaining order, or safety, or a combination thereof,” and that “no person shall allow or require” someone under age 21 to work as a bouncer “in an establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed.”
*  The bill specifies no new minimum age for bartenders or servers. As is now the case, they would need only be 18 or over to work at restaurants that serve alcohol; but at bars as defined by the 75 percent rule, the legislation would prohibit most employees, as well as customers, under age 21, since they could not be allowed in the door. An exception would be if the younger person were accompanied by “his or her parent, guardian or spouse who is 21 years of age or older.”
---
TL;DR
* Bars are defined in the bill.
* Self-reporting is required and modernized to fit today's standards.
* Bouncer is separately defined in the bill.
* Bartenders and waitresses in Statesboro would not be effected by this bill.

Uniqlo!!!!!!! They have REALLY long legs and fit athletics sized legs! They need to be tailored but I'm far to excited by the fact that they're too long to do it. They're fairly thick as well which makes it perfect for any weather! Plus they were part of the "sell out sale" because it's a colour that no one wants... Good thing is that I'm fairly girl next door blonde so it works really well with my complexion. 

 As Japanese as uniqlo is, they have some great sizing for bigger(not fat)/taller people
I would say that believing her is a good thing but we shouldn't be mistaken into not believing the accused as well. If we believe both parties and empathise with their perspectives we have the greatest likely hood of prosecuting the guilty, protecting the innocent and providing support where it is needed.
 Belief is good we just cant limit it to only one party.
When I initially wrote this response I misinterpreted the statistic  and assumed that the 97% value was not for the statistical estimation of annual rapes but for all alleged rapes reported to the police. Having now looked up the statistics which state ["Just 15 per cent went to the police, telling researchers it was “too embarrassing”, “too trivial” or a “private/family matter”."]( This would mean that the paragraph you are commenting on is actually factually incorrect albeit well intentioned.
In light of the massive 85% non reporting rate the police conviction rate of 3% sees a significant rise to 20% which when you include cases dropped due to the emotional strain of the experience in addition to the other factors begins to look more reasonable, when compared to rates for other crimes. [For cases where there is an arrest 40% are convicted of a felony and 48% receive at least some conviction. Rape in particular has low rates of Pretrial release of rape defendants 48% for rape compared to 58% for all other violent crimes. (1990's data)]( of course the police and justice system could definitely stand to improve but I would suggest that the main improvements that need to be changed are to accessibility, treatment of the plaintiff, invasiveness of initial interviews and greater encouragement to come forward.
**TLDR** It was never my intention to insinuate that the 97% figure was incorrect only that it was in many ways an inevitability in the light of our legal systems and I now have a greater realisation of how important it is to encourage higher levels of reporting. (sorry for blabbing in response to your very concise response)
So this morning I had an idea while I was doing my skin care routine. You see, I have been having a problem finding a good foundation that I like because I have fine lines and big pores so it seems like everything I try either settles into my lines and pores and makes them look worse or the powders make me look dry and cakey. I have tried all kinds of things from drug store BB creams to higher end powders like IT celebration.. Nothing worked for me, soooo I took my favorite moisturizer and on the back of my hand mixed in some mineral foundation with a small brush. I put it on my face just like I would moisturizer and it worked!  It gave me a sheer coverage that didn't settle in lines or pores  and evened out my skin tone. It left me looking like I wasn't wearing makeup, which I like. 
Maybe this is common knowledge and I am just behind on times since I am fairly new to makeup. If so please disregard, but it made me happy. lol
 I made tinted moisturizer and love it. 
&gt; room to grow
&gt; I'm learning every day at this new position and I'm loving it.
These are 2 very key things. I would actually recommend that you stay in your company and grow professionally as much as you can until you plateau (i.e. get bored, learned everything, can't get promoted anymore). It sounds like this company can provide you with lots of training that you can indeed write on your resume and it has a positive work environment with mentors -- this is much better than what most people have.
I am a big believer in taking time off school to do this work. You are earning money. You are filling your resume with accomplishments from the job and new skills. You are learning.
Schools, community colleges, and universities will still be here 1 year, 5 years, 10 years down the road -- they aren't going anywhere. But the oppurtinity to do meaninful work in a positive work environment with room to grow? Now *that* is rare!!!
If you are so inclined, I actually suggest you try taking (free) online courses in something you are interested in. There are so many of them, especially related to IT. 
**Stay in this good company until you have plateau'd. A good company is very rare and learn as much as you can in this oppurtinity. I don't think there's anything wrong with waiting 2 years to postpone your (formal) education. Consider taking online courses to round out your resume.**
I consider this an AI problem, not an issue with people not paying attention to what they're shooting. Also he probably runs beams which deal too much damage too quickly for the recent fix to work. 
Recently they made it so that small hits to shields wouldn't cause a bounty to be placed on your head, but I get one every time with my beam lasers.
Also, back to the AI bit, if a ship crosses your screen in the span of less than a second your reaction time has to be spot on to not shoot them, and not all of us have the reaction time of a late teen/early 20 something anymore. Even at around .4 seconds to react I've already shot them and have a measly 200/300 credit bounty on my head that I must go pay off immediately or be hunted. 
it still needs work
Lol my SO definitely eye rolls about how into the game i get. I still tell her whenever i do something cool like this or overcome an obstacle. 
A few days ago i was really struggling with the first hr pink rath fight and was triple carted several times. I was getting really frustrated so i set the game down and tried venting to her, still got some eye rolls. The next morning first thing I did was go into zen-mode and i beat the rath! I wasn't going to tell her this time but she looked over at me and asked how the hunt was going. It was so sweet and really suprised me!
 
 just tell her anyways and maybe she'll stop rolling her eyes?
Yes. The young man was a passenger in the Suv that was stopped on the road. In the SUV was his girlfriend. Apparently they were in an argument and he had thrown his or her glasses out of the car and they stopped to pick them up, but he was still upset and was just being a douche bag on the oncoming traffic side of the road.
The fucked up thing was, there was plenty of space to pull over on the shoulder, but she had literally put the fucking car in park in the left lane. 
2 20 year old kids arguing, parked on the road to retrieve glasses.
When I was a kid, I always heard some stories about my crazy uncle. He was only 14 when he started to hallucinate and my grandfather sent him to an asylum. He was basically forgot him in there until he was like, 40, when, my grandfather was dying of ELA and decided to say where he was and that he was sorry for having abandoned him.
My mom and her brother managed to find him, and when he came back we were there to welcome him, I will never forget the look on his face, he was terrified, so they let him stay at the garden, seated in a bench, in peace, what was his wish. After a few minutes my little sister, who was 6 years old, went next to him to say hello, he grabbed her neck with his huge hands, threw her in the ground and started to beat her. I was the only one paying attention so I started to scream. He came to me, grabbed me by my hair and beated me too. 
Nobody was warned that he might get violent, but it turned out that the place where he had been sent was almost a concentration camp (I live in Brazil, where recently many psychiatric institutions have had their brutal "treatments" uncovered and were shut down).
Over the years in there he was constantly raped, beaten up, electrocuted and all sorts of unimaginable suffering. My other uncle was the one who had picked him up, and didn't mention that he was deeply traumatized (he was a stupid drunk man).
He didn't beat us too hard because it all happened really fast and he was pretty weak, but it was scary as shit to see a mad man beating my sister and then coming after me. My family was able to hold him quickly and prevent something bad from happening.
He was taken to my grandmother's house where after  while he got used to live in society again, but he has the mental age of a 2 year old kid. He doesn't speak much (except for asking where is his father, the bastard who put him in that shit hole).
TL; DR: When I met my crazy uncle, me and my sister were beaten in a rage attack of a really disturbed man.
It wasn't what I saw, but what I heard at first then saw.
September 11th 2001. I was in third grade, in California, it was a school day but it started off odd.
Back then, as soon as the first person in my family woke up they'd turn on the news. I would watch the news and then some MTV before getting onto the bus. For whatever reason, nobody turned the TV on 'til after I left, they turned it on just in time to see plane 2 hit.
I didn't know.
I was on the Special Ed bus because of my wheelchair and all the buses, like every other district, had  short wave radios for communications between buses and then between buses and the base. 
Because the bus was a short bus (sat about 27 with one wheelchair or 24 with two wheelchairs, the back two seats were removable) everyone could hear the radio and thus everything that was going on with Base and other buses. 
We had all gotten used to the constant back and forth chatter (buses calling in traffic reports, mechanical issues, trouble with kids, and Base responding and calling out weather and traffic updates, sending different buses to different stops than usual to pick up the slack of broken buses or traffic issues and such) and it was rather soothing.
Now the SPED buses also had AM/FM radios. My bus driver usually had our on, a country music station or 101.9 The N, but this morning she hadn't turned it on all morning, her day started at 4 AM.
I was napping slightly when suddenly Base called out for every bus equipped with a AM/FM radio to turn it off. The speaker was very calm, very collected, but I remember waking up completely because that had never been done before.
Then the 'Bus Radio' was...silent. No chatter, no static. It was completely dead.
Then when we got to my school, the teachers were waiting for everyone. The SPED kids' teachers always met them at the bus, state law saying SPED kids cannot be left unsupervised if they are in the 'all day class' as it was called, but all the teachers of the school were out there to meet all their kids and shepard us to our classrooms.
This was weird too, as we usually had at least a half hour recess before school truly started. Kids would play or eat breakfast before the bell rang.
Breakfast was brought to the classrooms that morning. Lunch would be the same.
 I found out what happened in the classroom.
My third grade teacher was a bitch, one of those teachers that you wonder why the hell they went into elementary teaching at least. 
Each classroom in my school, and even the cafeteria, was equipped with a TV. My teacher hated it, never showed us movies or documentaries or whatever have you. I was surprised to learn she hadn't unplugged the damn thing.
She had it on that day, all day, on CNN. She only explained what was happening in the barest of ways.
It was like a bad disaster flick and all we were told that planes hit some towers in New York City. Teacher of the year everybody.
Now this teacher was also one of those types that thought if she wasn't working us to the bone we were doomed to be failures in life. No free time, no real parties. Lessons, classwork, coulldn't do homework until after school, and, if we were finished in class she gave us busy-work.
We had free time all day that day.
That's what I remember, that was the scariest day of my life.
 9/11/01, nothing was normal that day for anyone.
I had 'friends (basically what I like to call 'footy fags' who think because they play sport they're the best and untouchable)' who used to do this on a 6 lane highway, they asked me earlier if I wanted to come of course I said no they responded with 'what are you a pussy? UnAustralian_Aussies a PUSSY!!!' and I responded with 'No, clearly unlike you I have a perception of self preservation, however im going to consider you don't know what that means, it means I know that it's a complete stupid to step on a 6 lane highway riddled with b doubles so once again. No!'
They aren't my fronds anymkre
TL:DR: ex-fronds invite me to play chicken on a 6 lane highway
When I was younger, around 6 - 10 years old, my parents would fight *a lot*. I always witnessed them verbally insult each other and threaten each other with pretty pointless shit. 
Anyways, there was one day where my parents were really going at it. (I think I was 10 years old.) I knew my father would hit my mom sometimes, but he would always snap out of it and apologize because he felt bad about doing it. That day though, my dad was drunk off of his ass. He came home stumbling through the door and ready to pick a fight with my mom, who was laying down in their bedroom. I tried my best to convince him to just lay on the couch until he "felt better". He just yelled at me and shoved me out of the way and continued down the hallway, into the bedroom. 
I was pretty mad that he would just shove me like that, so I went to blow off my steam with some cartoons and juice. I kept the TV volume kind of low, just in case one of my parents needed me. 
I was having a good time watching my favorite shows when all of a sudden I hear some thrashing about going on in my parents' bedroom. At first, I didn't think much of it because it didn't really sound like anything to worry about. I continued my TV marathon when I heard my mom calling me. It sounded like she was gasping for air, so I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a glass of water, and ran back to the bedroom. 
As soon as I opened the door, I was met with the sight of my father trying to strangle my mom to death with a telephone cord. 
My mom's face was almost blue, and she was kicking her legs around like a fish out of water. My dad, still drunk off his ass, had the cord wrapped around my mom's neck, trying all he could to strangle her. 
I was horrified. I remember standing there for a few seconds before I snapped out of it and threw the glass of water right at my dad's face, causing him to let go of the phone cord. My mom scrambled towards me, grabbing her cellphone from the night stand to call the cops. 
I had never been so scared in my entire life. To think I almost witnessed my dad kill my mom right in front of my eyes really messed me up for some time afterwards. My parents are still together, they never left each other, but they still do have their differences. After the incident, my dad was taken to jail, but my mom decided not to press any charges because she still loved him. (Bless her soul.) I'm just glad my younger brother didn't witness any of that. He was staying at my grandma's because she was to take him to a doctor's appointment the next morning. 
**** Bad case of domestic violence between my parents. Scarred me for a long time. 
Not particularly terrible, but it was to ten year old me. 
It was a fall evening, probably early November, right after Halloween. It was dusk, and my mom and I were outside finishing the classic autumn chore: raking. I was bagging a pile of leaves when I heard a small voice yell, "hey!" from up the street. Our neighbor, no older than four at the time, was standing in his front yard. "Help!" he said. I turned to my mom and asked if I could go help the boy. Granted with permission, I head up the hill. 
As it turns out, his dogs had escaped and were now running around his yard, outside of the fence. I recruit my twin sister and older brother to help retrieve the two terriers. It wasn't easy, and they escaped from our small hands many times, but eventually we succeeded. Or so we thought. The boy released the dogs, and once more we had to retrieve them. 
I remember thinking how odd it was that this family still had their Halloween decorations out, especially one so creepy. The decoration was made to look like a man, lying on the ground. It bled from the mouth and moved its arms robotically. Once the dogs were released by the boy, they immediately ran to the thing and began licking its face. More than creeped out by it, my sister went back down to our house to tell our mother of the ghastly sight while my brother and I continued to chase the dogs. When my sister returned, she relayed back to us what our mother had told her: it's just a decoration, pay no mind. So we didn't. 
It didn't take long before we recaptured the dogs and returned them to their yard, as we had figured out their pattern. It was long dark by now, and before we left we asked the boy where his parents were. We hadn't seen them all night, why weren't they helping? "My mommy is at work," he said.
"What about your dad?" We didn't want to leave the boy alone.
Without saying a word, he pointed to the Halloween decoration. *Oh FUCK*. 
We go to get our mom, insisting she come up, as something was *seriously* wrong. When she does, we show her the decoration. Or what we *thought* was a decoration. 
Without a word to us, she pulls out her phone and dials 911. 
As it turns out, the decoration *was* the boy's father, who was having a stroke. Had we not been there, he would not have been discovered until midnight, when the mother returned home. He would have died. However, he luckily made a full recovery. 
Like I said, not a huge deal, but it was to me when it happened. 

*** 10 year old me accompanied with my siblings help out our young neighbor only to discover that what we previously thought was a Halloween decoration was in fact the boy's father having a stroke. 
I witnessed something just the other day that I believe will scar me for quite some time.  
We were in the city for the St. Patrick's day parade.  It had since died off and we were making a walk back when I witnessed something that I will never forget.  I remember looking up while walking and seeing a man, let's call him Steve, shove a relatively older man, Bob probably in his early 60s, to the ground.  At this point, Steve is on top of Bob and just not holding back.  Punch after punch to the head/face of Bob, while he is doing nothing to stop Steve.  Now Steve was also accompanied by his girlfriend, I'm going to name her Sue.  The entire time Steve is ruthlessly beating Bob, Sue is next to them kicking Bob in the head and side of the body.  Finally Steve gets up and kicks Bob a few times and starts yelling something that I could not make out as we, and other people who had stopped on the side of the road, started to approach them.  
Steve and Sue were clearly very intoxicated and the last I remember of the two were them running away as a man chased them.  We approached Bob with a couple other people and he was completely unresponsive.  He was bleeding from the ear, both eyes, and his nose.  Now I've seen my fair share of fights, but have never seen a defenseless person just get beat senseless like that before.  
I have never been much of a fighter, but after seeing that happen I have contemplated becoming a pacifist.  This happened two days ago and I can't seem to get that horrific image out of my mind.  I regret that I did not step in or do anything at all to help, it was as if I just froze when I saw it happen.  I do not know what ended up happening to any of them, all that I know is that the police were called as people were telling us to leave, being young adults they did not want us to have to see this gruesome sight anymore.
tl;dr
Defenseless man beat completely senseless.
Back in 2004, i was staying at a cabin in west virginia which i have visited many times before. I arrived a day before my friends and when it turned dark i decided to hike to a little water fall and thought to take some pictures of the fall and skies for my then GF. Well on my walk back to the cabin i heard a noise behind me and turned around to catch a glimpse of a figure in dark clothing dash behind a tree. I waited flashlught pinned on this tree for a couple of seconds, then took out my pistol and announced that i had a gun, nothing. Then i started to walk backwards for roughly 20 yards and then sprinted. Well i didn't want to lead who ever it was back to the cabin, so i took a path that i knew looped close to where it was after a mile and a half. After about what seemed like forever i slowed down to catch my breath. Turned around and again to find nothing. When i arrived back at the cabin i found the door cracked open, i then ran to my car and booked it to the nearest motel roughly an hour away and called my friends saying the trip was off, never told them what happened fearing that they would not take me seriously. To this day that was the scariest shit i have ever been through and still dont know who or what opened that door.
Took a walk away from my cabin was followed by a dark figure and upon my return to the cabin the door was open.
Was a few years back (I was about 15), friends and I in town after a firework show, it's about 10, we leave McDonalds and a drunk guy (about 50) is outside and he seems to be confused. We try to help him out, he says he needs to get a bus, we walk him to a bus stop, during which time he takes a liking to me. We get to the stop, he doesn't get on bus and instead follows us an keeps asking to fight me. I see a police officer down the street, tell him about ordeal, he cautions him and tells us just to avoid him, we walk back past him at the bus stop, at this point he is standing in front of a bus waving both of his arms, he notices me, reaches for a knife out of his pocket and begins to chase my friends and I up a street. Him being 50, gets exhausted and gives up.

 15 year old me helps drunk guy out, he then chases me with knife
Oh sure, a dog will be your best friend and save your life, but will it shit in a box and act too cool for you the way a cat will?
 fuck cats, dogs rule
My story is rather long, but I will try to make it as brief as possible.  My friend had a huge passion for making movies, heck, we all did, and we spent most of our high school weekends in my woods or out at someone’s house making short films.  None of them were that amazing, but we loved it.  

One summer by buddy decided he wanted to propose to his girlfriend.  She loved his films, and supported him, so what better way to propose then through a movie?  The movie was basically a Lord of the Rings type movie.  The film would be called “The Heart of a Warrior.”  

In the movie my buddy, playing the main character, would have to fight his way through Satan and his demons, portrayed by us, to win the battle for the heart of his lady.  My character was Satan’s right hand demon, named blindness.  My character would be in a sort of battle with Brazen, another demon, to defeat the warrior and take the maiden.  Each of our characters would be represented by an animal at various points in the movie, Blindness being a wolf.  My buddy had a husky that we were going to use.  

Long story short, we had practiced our dark speech for our parts daily, had costumes, cameras, weapons and everything we needed.  I was at a girl’s house and my buddy was coming to pick me up for a movie meeting.  I went outside and sat on the front of her car in the driveway waiting for my friend to come get me.  We were in the middle of nowhere, Ohio.  Her driveway goes up to the road, on the left is a hedge that lines her yard all the way to the driveway.  On the right is a giant tree blocking the light from a safety light on the lightpost so that only about 8 feet of her driveway is lit.  As I sat there, the most massive (four feet tall), demonic, horrific looking wolf slowly walked into the light, stopped, and stared straight into my eyes.  I was frozen solid for about ten seconds.  It then turned its head, and walked behind the hedge where I could no longer see it.  I jumped in the car locked the doors and started calling my friend and the girl whose house I was at.  Neither would answer.  I got brave enough to run to her door and knock on the door so I could come inside.  The door connects to her living room, where her, her mother, father, and sisters were all watching a movie.  I was knocking as furiously and loudly as I possibly could but no one would answer. I could hear the movie, I could hear their remarks to each other.  I knocked for about two minutes until I gave up and ran back to the car.  Finally my buddy answered his phone.  I asked where he was and he said he had been sitting in the driveway for ten minutes.  I started screaming “YOU ARE NOT HERE!”  He started yelling back saying he was and that he had been to this house a hundred times.  After about a minute or so he said, “dude… I am somehow at the wrong house down the road…”  He came to get me, I jumped in his car and we took off.  The girl finally called me back and I asked why she wouldn’t answer the door.  She told me no one had knocked and her phone never rang.  

To this day I have no idea what that was, or why it happened.  I am a very strong Christian and believe some spiritual warfare was at play, judge me if you want, I know what I saw and it changed me.  We never ended up making the movie because his relationship fell apart, yet somehow, I was glad the entire time because I was terrified to become that demon again.

 I was playing a demon in a movie portrayed as a wolf, and saw the most demonic, and horrifying wolf-like creature I have ever seen.
Two things. In October of 2010 I was driving my normal route to work on the interstate at about 60 mph which of course was nice because normally its a slow roll all the way into the city. I was in that sort of hypnotic autopilot mode, but distinctly remember seeing the cab of an 18 wheeler in the far right lane jerk up and back. That means hard brakes. I immediately hit my brakes as I watched the truck jackknife across all 4 lanes of traffic and strike the wall about 20 yards in front of me. I was able to stop but the mini van in lane 3 had nowhere to go and I remember seeing the front of his van go under the solid steel train car the truck was carrying. I checked my mirrors to make sure no one was going to hit me then exited my car and ran to the van. Mike (I found later to be the drivers name) was going into shock, had a gaping cut over his eye and was pinned in by the steering wheel. I crawled in the back seat to keep him calm and keep him talking. He's OK now. But the adrenaline hit afterward and I lost it. 
Second just a few days ago I watched the tail end of an SUV scream by my side mirror then hit the median and flip into oncoming traffic. 
- bad drivers everywhere. 

Edit: Mike's seatbelt and airbag saved his life. Please use them. The end. 
I'm late to this party, but here it goes anyway. I was about 18 or 19 years old driving my beat up old pick up truck. It was my first vehicle, it was a 1984 Chevy s 10. I was driving toward my house and my little brother was with me in the truck. Coming up the road my light is green so of course I go through the light and all the sudden this woman is coming straight at us. She was turning left so she was running a red light, and also when I looked out of my window she was grabbing for something in the seat next to her not paying attention. To this day I dont know how we didnt get hit. She was so close to the door of my side of the truck that I could have reached out and touched the grill of her SUV. All I could do was throw my arm out over my brother and close my eyes, and wait. But nothing happened. I heard screeching, I felt the truck bump up over something, and I slammed on the breaks. When I opened my eyes I was in a parking lot that was on the right side of the street a little ways up from the intersection. Everyone that was in that parking lot was looking at us with their eyes wide and mouths open. I looked over at my brother and he was pale as a sheet and had this "HOLY SHIT" look on his face. I was so overwhelmed by fear and relief that I burst into tears. The scariest thing of course was the idea that my little brother could have been severely hurt. Had that lady hit us, I would either be dead or seriously fucked up. 
** somehow escaped what should have been a t-bone accident and wound up in a parking lot a few meters away instead.**
So my older brother and some of his friends went shooting on my grandparents farm. We like to shoot/blow up stuff that we don't need anymore such as dryers, dishwashers, etc. On this day we shot up an old vacuum. When it was all destroyed we got the genius idea to use the metal handle, prop it up and put a shotgun shell on it and try to shoot the pin and make it fire. After many tries we finally hear a loud bang. We look around and we see one of my brothers friends holding his neck and blood running through his hand. He lets go and there's a small gash on his neck. Apparently the shell kicked back into his neck and grazed. He said he didn't need medical attention and it didn't hurt. 
**Tried shooting a shotgun shell and because Newton's Third Law the shell hit a friend in the neck**
One time in the elementary school I was working on a project during class time on the library computers with my partner. I guess we clicked on spam and it wouldn't close and  because we were researching Brazil it was a, may I say, risqué link. But shit I was in 4th grade I had no idea what had even happened. Anyway, teacher yells at us in front of everyone and takes us to the assistant principal's office where he then interrogated the shit out of us. I WAS A FOURTH GRADE GIRL WHY THE FUCK WOULD I BE LOOKING UP PORN? Well I could either lie and confess that I did it on purpose or I would be sent to the principal's.  
Alas, I was convicted and had in-school suspension. Word spread like fire at the playground that I was into naked girls. You could say the rest of the school year was not the greatest year of my life. 
sometimes the assistant principal scares the shit out of eight year old you and then you confess you're into Brazilian porn rather than having to go to the principal's office. 
Friend falling to what what would eventually be his death. 
We are at a house party in an flat/apartment at the top of a building. It was an old building so the apartment was basically the loft of this building all the walls were slanted. As it was the top of the building the windows were built out of the roof. A few guys were going out the bedroom window climbing over the roof and in the kitchen window. This was about 3am so everyone was post club and wated on booze and pills at least. The friend I am chatting to decides to join the fun as we were sitting on the end of a bed facing the bedroom window. He loses his grip on the roof tiles and goes sliding down the roof managing to grab the gutter as he falls without even getting up I can see his fingers clinging to the edge and before it had sunk in they were gone. Panic sets in and we all leg it down to the street where he'd landed. He is sitting propped up against the wall. Later, we find out he has landed on his ass and broken his hips, ribs, arms etc. Where he has fallen is set slightly away from the actual road so I call an ambulance and go out to the street to try and show them where he is. A cop car stops and I mistakenly think they heard the call and are trying to help, instead they try to arrest me for trying to pick up prostitutes. Everything gets explained and he ends up in hospital. A few weeks later he is released for hospital and I go round to visit him, no answer.  He is dead. Intentional overdose stated as cause of death. Two days later the Dad phones me and tries to blame me. 
TLDR Roof fall, almost arrested, guy dies, Dad blames me. 
When I was about 7 we lived in South Africa. At about 4am my Great Dane started barking along with my other two dogs. I heard this huge smash of glass (seriously big, I was in such a deep sleep and it's still managed to startle me)  For some reason I thought someone had fallen down the stairs into the glass table. (7 yr old brain) all of a sudden there were huge bangs which turned out to be gunshots, they are so much louder and scarier I'm real life. I hear screaming and my dad ran in my room and picked me up then we ran to his room. He put me on the bed and got his gun and my mums revolver out of the drawers. My dad them raced to the stairs to make sure they don't come up. He had been a lieutenant in the military so I thought he would know how to keep them away. At the same time there were constant gunshots and I was screaming under my covers. My mum meanwhile tried calling the police but they are so corrupt they didn't give a crap. The gunshots stopped and I feared my dad was killed so I ran to the stairs and luckily he's standing there unscathed. The police didn't end up arriving for 4 hours. They shot one of my dogs and the others ran to the other side of the house. It turns out our electric/barbed fence hadn't been shut by the maid properly and they smashed our huge window to take our plasma TV. SIX of them all with guns. In the morning we woke up to find the windows above the bed smashed so bullets on the floor. If my dad had stayed standing in the room he would have been shot directly in the head. To this day I freak out when I hear glass break. I suffered from PTSD after that incident combined with other things like being held at gunpoint Ect. Luckily I moved to nz 5 years ago and we just got our citizenship. 
 armed robbery when I was 7 dog shot and dad nearly died. Police were corrupt.
It was my first day as a Teaching Associate in my doc program and they had us previously paired with tenured profs to learn the ropes.  My mentor decided I was good enough to go alone for classes while he joined a protest over raising tuition and cutting the budget in Harrisburg.  One of my students kept looking a bit flushed, but I figured she was hungover (as several had already proclaimed themselves to be before class).  About halfway through the lecture, she weakly raised her hand to inform me she couldn't see...
I kicked all my kids out of the room except for she and her best friend.  Realized I didn't have my cell with me and I was in one of the few rooms without a phone.  Told the best friend to watch over her, went to a prof's office in the next hallway and asked her to call campus security because one of my students needed to go to a hospital ASAP.  She placed the call and then ran back with me to the room.
Ended up holding the girl's hand while she was terrified and eventually had to go outside to tell my next class that I was "running a bit behind schedule" and to go get a coffee.  Something that was shown patently false when the EMTs arrived with a stretcher and the prof from down the hall and I held the doors for them.  After second class, where I was probably almost noncoherent, I had to write up emails to my mentor, the department chair, and campus security with what all happened.  We had to contact the student's family to inform them that their daughter was now in a hospital.  

It turned out she was going into some form of diabetic shock or something and had never been diagnosed with diabetes before.  She thanked me once she came back to class the next week, but still, thinking that you're watching one of your students die and feeling helpless to prevent it is one of the most terrifying things ever, let alone your first day on the job.  
***:  First day alone as a Teaching Associate, student nearly dies (or at least came close to diabetic coma) in my classroom after uttering the words "I can't see".  Student gets taken to hospital.
When I was 16 I was round at a friends house just hanging out, playing some Halo. We took a break so he could go to the toilet and I could go get a drink from the kitchen. 
Now a little backstory on the house layout. My friends room is at one end of it, the toilet is pretty much right beside his room, and the kitchen is at the other end of the house and you have to walk past the living room to get there.
Back to the story. As I'm walking to the kitchen, I glance into the living room and see his (soon to be) step-dad take a swing at his mother and catch her right above her right eye, knocking her out almost immediately. Now at the time I was around 5'10" and 138lbs, his step-dad was 6'1" and nearly 250lbs. 
My first response was to yell out his mothers name to try get a response, my yelling seemed to make the step-dad snap out of it and he realised what he did and kind of freaked out. He stepped back and tried swinging at me but missed, due in part to my reflexes and his being very drunk. He took another swing and this time I stepped up under it and punched him in the jaw. He threw me to the ground and went outside after this.
My friend came out of the toilet and went over to his mother (he could hear all this from the toilet he later told me), and woke her up while I went to check on the step-dad. He was coming back up the stairs with an axe.
My friend grabbed a butchers knife from the kitchen and threw it at me while he called 111 to get the cops. I told his step-dad to either leave or I will cut him, and he kept coming at me. So I waited until he got just about level with the door before flinging the knife at him while kicking the door closed in his face, the knife caught his arm and the door broke his nose from the impact. 
We then locked the door and made sure his mother was safe while we waited for the cops to come and arrest him.
 Friends step-dad gets drunk and hits his mother, we have to fight back for our own safety
Had friends die and seen other motorcyclist wreck in the worst ways. Still doesn't stop me. I just ride like everyone is trying to kill me, which helps because I put so much distance between me and anyone else and keep an eye on every, little thing. Staying alert keeps you on two wheels. I've also spent countless hours learning how to crash in the safest way possible (yeah, contradictory for some, I know. But there's procedures) and can even turn a high side into a low side. I love my bike, I can't give it up out of fear, I mean I also live a pretty dangerous life in general. I am a welder in the port of tampa, so Florida sun, smoke and loud noises, heavy lifting, super high heights and enough amperage to kill a person and I do all that on a daily basis. I eat like a little piggy, I'm joining the military and I ride a motorcycle. I think I've accepted that what I do is dangerous so it's why I don't have that "sobering moment" like you had. That or my love of riding and living the way I do just overdoes my fear of death. 
&amp; Disclaimer - I'm glad you are happy with the way you've changed your ways, I'm by no means arguing that you were wrong for deciding motorcycles weren't best for you. I'm just showing two sides of the coin. I just like to share that there are some people out there who love to ride, most times I hear someone mention motorcycles outside of r/Motorcycles and r/bikesgonewild it always turns into motorists jumping on the hate wagon for motorcycles and their riders. 
In fifth grade while taking the bus to school we passed by a little park next to an apartment complex. In one of the trees a kid hung himself. It was one of the girls on the bus brother and I remember hearing her screaming at the bus driver to stop but he just kept going. I think that was the right thing to do but her screaming was just awful. What's worse is she was someone I never got along with, so I felt like all I  could do was watch. First time I had seen death and I had nightmares about it for three years. Still one of the only things I can remember clearly from my childhood.
Saw someone who had hung themselves from a tree in fifth grade.
The day I got back from my first deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom, me and two buddies went for a drive and to go get dinner.  I was in the back seat, sitting behind the driver.  The guy decided it'd be a good idea to show off how fast his new car was, and how well it handled (Me and the other passenger had deployed, he had stayed behind).  The very last thing I said to him before the crash was "Dude, if you get me killed in this thing, I'm gonna come back and haunt your ass."
He hit a patch of debris (I think it might have been broken glass, I seem to remember seeing some bright reflective stuff in the air behind us), and that made him lose control.  He drifted towards the side of the road, and over-corrected (if he hadn't, we'd have landed in the lobby of a Little Caesars).  There was just enough of a rise in the road so that our momentum carried us up and forward with a left-ward yaw.  When we did make contact with the road again, we crossed the center-line and collided nearly head-on with a little Ford Ranger (we were in a 2002 Toyota Celica).
The impact broke the front-seat passenger's neck, and even though we were all wearing seatbelts, the angle and severity of the collision drove his head into the head of the driver.  The front-seat passenger died on the scene.  The head-butt separated the hemispheres of the driver's brain and he died around 2am the next morning.  His parents later told me that when they went to see him, his head had swelled to the size of a watermelon.
I hit my head on the back window, and that knocked me out (the back window on a 2000-era Toyota Celica is positioned almost perfectly to do exactly that.  Pretty serious design flaw if you ask me.)  According to the police report, witnesses heard a screaming woman in the back seat.  So it's officially a matter of record: I scream like a girl.
When I came to in the hospital, the last thing that I remembered, (at the time.  The accident all came flooding back to me over the next two weeks, in vivid detail... what a fun experience THAT was), was that I had been deployed.  The ER doctors told me I'd been in a vehicle accident.  I'd assumed that we'd been attacked on the bus-ride to work, and I'd somehow survived to be airlifted out.  They were asking me if I knew where I was. "Oman?"  A lot of concerned looks between doctors.  They told me I was home, which made NO sense.
I was clearly in agony, so they gave me morphine.  That's how I found out that I'm allergic to morphine.  My veins were on fire, the walls were melting and the doctors all had lizard tails under their white doctor coats.
** So it's a toss-up for me.  The scariest thing I've ever witnessed is either a fatal head-butt or a bad trip from some REALLY powerful medication.**
During the blizzard of 1978 a small dog jumped into our back seat of our car. My dad had to go to work for the Army. We ended up bonding with the dog and we kept him after finding no one that took ownership.
In 1979, my dad got orders to Ft Sill. We moved and lived in Lawton, Ok. This was a different time and Ok. was much more open field and free. (I haven't been back since). This wonderful dog would help warn us of pending thunder storms and the possibility of a tornado. We saw a few and ran from 2 that I remember. 
All of this is leading to one night my dog didn't come home. Being a free roaming, well trained dog we were a little worry he might have been hit by a car. The next night I was in tears (I was 9). We heard a scratch at the door and it was my dog. I was elated. I went to pet him and he yelped. I looked down and was startled to see someone or something had sliced open his side. The gash went from behind his left leg to high on his neck. I could see the shoulder bone and the muscle surrounding it. I was scared to death for him. We convinced our dad to take him to the vet (standard in the 70's for poor people was to put them out of their misery). He received multiple stitches and survived the ordeal. 
Two years later and back in Indianapolis he was hit by a car. His neck was limp and he had blood coming out of his mouth and from his side. He was still alive, but barely. I couldn't believe my (his) luck. My parents ran him to the vet, but his injuries were to great and he was put down. Of course, I was devastated. To this day (I'm 43) I have never allowed myself to love another animal as deeply as I loved him. My wife has tried to get me to love our pets, but I can't because I know how quickly they can be taken.
And just last week we had to put down our chihuahua that we had for 16.5 years. We got him as a puppy and he grew up with my children. They all attended the appointment to say goodbye. Watching my children cry over his death brought back those old memories and I knew what they were feeling. As a father their is nothing tougher than watching your children hurting and knowing you can't make it better. I could only offer my shoulder and a tissue. 
Sorry, for the long story. I wanted to pass it along because I needed to talk about it. This seemed like the right thread. RIP to both of my only loved dogs (as I tear up writing this). 
 Watched 2 of my dogs die
One time at the gym when I was doing my heavy deadlifts and squats I saw a female friend/acquaintance of mine, I smiled, waved hello, that was it. 
Found it like a week later that at one point during the day she saw me looking at her and laughing at her for sucking at the gym. There was no point in my workout that I did that, I literally had my headphones on and was working out solo not giving a shit about anything. For fuck's sake I wear long, polka dot socks to the gym, I don't care about appearance or being snooty or anything. I guess she just constructed shit in her head.
female friend got self-conscious and thought I was making fun of her, people need to realize that nobody at the gym gives a fuck about anyone else. Just shut the fuck up and lift. 
I did not think about a nationalized pharmacare program until last year, and I really do believe its a great idea.
I am 20 years old and last September I was diagnosed with a large brain tumour called a Prolactinoma. It is a common type of benign tumour however my Neurosurgeon had never encountered one of this size. It is a genetic problem that caused it and therefore there was nothing I could do to prevent it. Thankfully I was able to avoid an extremely risky surgery to have it removed because there is a drug that targets the hormone the tumour was made of and would stop the tumour from growing, allowing in to shrink over time. Since I have been on this medication the tumour has shrank around 80-90% of its original size. 
However the drug is very expensive and without insurance it would be impossible for me to afford. Right now I am on my Mothers insurance plan but when it runs out this year I will have to find a new one to cover me, and even with insurance the 20% cost of the drug I need to cover is expensive. Due to the small number of people needing this drug it is far too expensive for most people to afford without some kind of subsidy. I have had to put my university education on hold and have struggled maintaining full time work because of my situation. Like our healthcare system, a national pharmacare plan would help millions of Canadians who need support to afford their prescription medicine. I have to take my meds possibly for the rest of my life to ensure my tumour does not return and my condition has given me a drastic disadvantage in life. 
Its the conservative morons who always preach that we live in a society where everyone is on an equal playing field and we all just need to pull up our bootstraps. Well my bootstraps were trimmed short because of my Genes, and the current federal government would rather pretend this problem does not exist and focus on the scary terrorists who are gonna come an get u. I have always supported the LPC in the past but I am starting to realize they will never offer real solutions and only try and steal the left vote by paying lip service to their ideals. I think its about time the NDP get a fair shot at running the country. However god damn unlikely it is for them to win, I would rather vote on my principles then bow my head to a liberal government who will not achieve anything real. The NDP is the only party that has given support to national pharmacare. 
Edit: TL/DR The drugs that save my life from a tumour cost me too much $$$. I will struggle to afford university without subsidized pharmacare. Con government wants to pretend people like me do not exist. Vote NDP?
haha alright I see. I already thought tl stood for 'too long', but it makes sense now:) thank you!
ps: I'm probably the only one who reads all the incoherent drunken rants before seeing the tldr then;p
A Lot of great info in this thread! 
I don't have assetto corsa yet, (but its a game I plan on getting when not I'm completely broke) 
but an incredibly affordable Logitech g27 landed in my lap at my job(the day after I researched racing wheels for the first time)  I really dug racing games before the logitech g27, but man after using this for a couple of days its the best gaming related accessory I have ever bought. Not only did it increase my passion for racing games I have been teaching people the basics of driving stick shift with it without having them blow my motor in my car. 

tldr- A g27 fell into my lap by chance, I needed to change my underwear immediately,  2 days later im browsing this subreddit.  
Looking at his stats, I wanted to build health, attack, defence and accuracy. My first ISO was Steady.  
  I'll copy a paste from user [568624]( from   (with a bit of formatting)
  
&gt; I've got 4 Steady, 3 Forceful and 1 Stalwart. That gives him:
&gt; +2145 Health, +688 Attack, +344 Defense and +602 Accuracy. It looks like a solid enough build to give him everything he needs to hurt people. To be honest, I came up with this build focusing on his "Frenzy" buff.
For a focus on his "Enchanted Armor" buff, that build would be: 3 Patient, 2 Steady, 2 Forceful, and 1 Stalwart. That gives him:
&gt; +2574 Health, +430 Attack, +516 Defense and +602 Accuracy. I sacrificed a bit of attack to boost Health and Defense since he's going to focus on protecting. He still has pretty good attack this way.
&gt;A mix build would be: 3 Steady, 2 Patient, 2 Forceful and 1 Stalwart. That gives him:
&gt; +2574 Health, +516 Attack, +430 Defense and +602 Accuracy. Gives him a good mix of Health, Attack and Defense so he can either focus on "Frenzy" or "Enchanted Armor". I might use this one personally.
  
 
  

Buff Emphasis | Build
---|---
Frenzy buff | 4 Steady, 3 Forceful 1 Stalwart  
Enchanted Armor | 3 Patient, 2 Steady, 2 Forceful, 1 Stalwart  
Weaker mix of both | 3 Steady, 2 Patient, 2 Forceful 1 Stalwart
Please remember, this is just some guy on the internet, s/he is not necessarily a statistics major. Consider this, but play with it! :D
Suppose the Apple service (+ ATV) does deliver the content and features [live + (immediate) on demand + DVRish service) I want and I am currently renting a DVR box, it would make sense to switch: lose the rental fees, get a better interface. It's potentially even a partial win for the cable company in a way, as they offload equipment servicing costs. 
That's definitely a win for the consumer, and presumable Apple. However, I don't think it's going to be the win for your wallet that everyone is hoping for. 
* I don't expect any of these companies to take a haircut on their earnings/revenue. I expect that the net cost of the service to a subscriber is going to stay the same, maybe less rental fees if we're lucky (unless you cut out some of the content you desire... which will probably be packaged in a way that you won't be able to without losing a lot of content). The cable operators simply raise internet pricing to compensate for TV subscriber losses. 
* I expect the features to be less than optimal, although not necessarily worse than the status quo. No more DVR, imperfect content availability, mixed bag of on-demand with ads, mixed bag of live programming, mixed streaming quality, still some fragmentation to get what you want.
Now, for cordcutters this may pose an opportunity to get some additional content. But I fully expect Apple to find the upper limit of what cordcutters as a group are willing to pay.
It needs to be pretty damn slick to get me to abandon my WMC + hdhomerun on HTPC.

 This is not necessarily going to save anyone money over a cable package, but will likely/hopefully lead to an improved experience.

&gt; I'd rather pay the same cost and have 100% of the channels be stuff I enjoy, than pay that amount and only get 10% of channels I like.
This is one of the most nonsensical things I have ever read on the internet.
 /u/RandyHoward would rather pay the same amount for less product.  His cable company is ripping him off by giving him too much stuff for his money!
HELP ME /u/TL-DR-BOT!
I found this on the front page. 
Basically TVs favorite Chocolate Einstein breaks it down like only he can. I love this guy. He takes an incredibly complex and high brow topic and makes it very accessible to those of us who aren't astronomy oriented. 
TL:DR; NdGT talks astronomy, physics and abstract math for 3 hours, and trashes Christianity a couple of times while he does it.

Yes, in GBW's second term there was an increase to the federal minimum wage under the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. Jeb Bush now wants to eliminate that federal minimum wage and leave it up to states. If that happens, states with lower or no minimum wage (Louisiana Alabama Mississippi Tennessee and South Carolina currently have none) will attract far more jobs from states which maintain a livable minimum wage. In order to get these jobs back, the other states will have to drop minimum wage to compete with them, leading to an overall reduction of wages for everyone. 
Your argument is stupid because Jeb is proposing exactly the opposite of what happened under W.
The harm is that we're spending too much time arguing that the minimum wage in NYC needs to be high, while someone else argues that value is too high for someone in Kansas.
Yes.  Both people are probably right.  The cost of living varies too widely for a federal minimum to be a valid solution to anyone's problem.
Stop trying to set a federal minimum that makes sense for both NYC and Kansas.  Any value set for both is going to either be too high for one locality, or too low for the other.  It makes for great political talking points and plenty of distractions from relevant federal issues.
A federal minimum wage is about as worthless as a federal standard for the number of lanes on a road.  Let local problem be met with local solutions.  The federal government should spend their time focussing on federal problems.  
 Opportunity cost is the harm in leaving it be.
Actually, the answer there is usually gerrymandering. They've set it up so that the votes of moderate, liberals, and minorities basically count for less than those of conservatives. They claim to love American democracy, then systematically pervert, subvert, and flagrantly break its core tenants in order to win. The issue isn't just that our voter turnout is low, it much more complex. Money in politics, media that is complicit (or incompetent), gerrymandered districts, active discouragement/disenfranchisement, etc. All of those things also (not coincidentally) help lower voter turnout.
 Complex political issues don't have one underlying cause. Who would have thought?
I'd say you pretty much still *need* a mandatory minimum wage above the poverty line to avoid corporate subsidies through social services on unsustainable business models. Because 'dirty' corporations will abuse every loophole they can find.
For example: In Germany there are a lot of strong unions, but the law is still kinda flawed in favor of corporations. There are a lot of things they can do through subcontractors (which coincidentally happen to be owned by board members/high management), 'mandatory/pro corporate unions (if they have enough members competing unions lose all leverage and have to accept the same terms).
And then there's other stuff like intentionally poor work time scheduling. Instead of hiring full time employees, they use mostly part time workers (that are cheaper, because insurance and stuff) combined with a very low staff ceiling to force people into flexible schedules, that require them to be available *all week* to get their 20h or something, which prevents them from having multiple jobs due to the unreliable schedule (and getting fired if you're a no show), which again forces them into social services. Those things effectively subsides shitty corporate behavior with govt. taxes, that they shouldn't 'receive' at all.
 minimum wage doesn't fix major issues in the system, *but* it closes some of the worst loopholes, that corporations use to fuck with people.
&gt; This is supply and demand at its most basic. When the cost of something, whether it be a television or a worker, decreases, more of it is bought.
Assume a spherical cow?  You could probably find a pretty cheap Geforce 7900, I have one on my desk right now, but demand for them is rather astoundingly low.
&gt;Thus the cost of their product goes down. 
Again, why?  If the employee salary decreases, the employer is under NO obligation to lower prices unless the demand for the product the employee is selling changes.  Now it very well might, because a lower end retail store is going to find without a minimum wage their customers have even less to spend, so demand would drop, but this sounds like a race to the bottom.
&gt;Now, you might say that the lowered cost of production won't translate to lowered cost of goods (and thus higher demand), and that the increased profits won't be reinvested into the company.
Well, given that we have a minimum wage right now and companies are still sitting on piles of cash as their productivity skyrockets but real wages stagnate, yeah, 'reinvesting' hasn't really been seen.
&gt;There are several things wrong with this. (a) The stockholders more or less keep a company responsible for reinvesting excess profits back into the company for expansion.
For a publicly traded firm, you might be able to make this argument.  "Pay us dividends, or invest in something", but again, companies are sitting on rather large piles of cash right now, even without removing a minimum wage.
For a company owned privately, there are no stockholders to appease in the first place.
&gt;It would take a massive collusion between all of the companies of a given sector of the economy to ensure that they all don't lower their prices.
... Yeah... because we've never seen companies manage to do that.  I mean it's not like we are expected to pay thousands of dollars for a cheap rock from the ground because of some cartel.
It's profitable for companies to collude more than compete, and if you've managed to become quite profitable, it's pretty easy to ensure no one ever gets to force 'real competition'.  How does eliminating the minimum wage fix that?
&gt;Thus, the market forces these companies to lower the prices. 
And it sounds like saying "in a perfect economy that ran by rules which clearly don't reflect the reality of the economy".  I can use ideal gas law to model some systems, but it fails if I try to model every gas that way.
In practice, minimum wage jobs aren't used for large scale employment in the US with sectors that have demand which scales primarily based on that same minimum wage labor.  You can 'invest' in a ton of PhDs to design a new computer chip, pay more PhDs, get more product, and you will create demand for your product, but those aren't minimum wage jobs.
EDIT:   The US doesn't necessarily have an 'efficient market' economy, and assuming it would if we eliminated the minimum wage seems silly. 
At first I was "wow........he's really listening." Then I was "wait, ELIMINATE it? Like, 'here, shithead, here's your 3.34 an hour...'" I'm bitter. 
I think it would be best if you educated yourself on marijuana. If you want him to trust you, don't tell your parents. Furthermore, this is his choice and he'll likely continue to do it no matter how Mich anyone tries to forbid it. 16 is around the age when most people first start smoking pot, so this really isn't something uncommon. If you really think he shouldn't be smoking, then you need to talk to him and tell him the **facts** about what he's doing to himself. Don't try to scare him into thinking it's going to kill him, because it won't and it can't. Some of the harmful effects of smoking include tar build up in the lungs, and memory loss. You can truthfully persuade with arguments like that, but I guarantee you he will just scoff at you if you try to tell him its deadly or can make you violent. 
tell him the facts, don't tell parents, he will make his own choices.
19 here. I go as much as possible, probably 20-30 times a year. Maybe its just where I live, but I rarely if ever have bad experiences at the theater. In my life, money has never been tighter than right now, and I usually only have money for food, but going to the movies is just something I couldn't do without. 

Maybe I just have really bad impulse control, but I could not stand waiting for a movie I want to see to be released online or on Blu Ray. And if the options are between torrenting and going to the movies, I feel better about going to the movies.

Also the main issue I have with watching stuff at home isn't the size of the screen, but the sound. I love that huge theater sound, with bass that you can feel in your chest. Yes I know I could get a great speaker set up, but honestly the money I spend on that I would much rather spend on going to theater.
Furthermore to those who complain about prices (specifically those living in the US, I know some countries have ridiculous prices): #1 You do not have to buy concessions #2 Many movie theatres have special morning deals, for instance the AMC Theaters have $6 tickets before Noon (when incidentally the theaters are also less crowded).
Honestly I don't really get why more young people aren't going to the movies. I can understand the adults who have work and other things to balance, and may end up paying for 4+ people. But teenagers who are only paying for one ticket, it seems like a pretty great way to spend the afternoon with friends.
 They can take our lives, but they'll never take OUR MOVIE THEATERS!
Always love it when people wish physical harm on others out of jealousy. Fact of the matter is yeah, he's probably going to get hit and it's definitely going to hurt. But not only is Brady the GOAT but he's also one of the most durable with only the one fluke ACL tear. So I think it's much more likely it'll be the Jets dicks going limp after Brady shoves his straight down your metaphorical throats. 
 Bring on the season. Please. 
It'd be better if AMD had more cards with HBM other than the 390 and 390x. The way AMD launches new series is adding new architecture to the higher end cards and previous gen gets rebranded and becomes the new mid tier. While not everyone is able to afford all the fanciest tech, HBM is a huge selling point and a huge competitive advantage if HBM has significant performance increases as rumored that the 390x is comparable to the GTX TitanX. 
Sadly, not everyone will be able to afford a 390/390x. 
I'm sure everyone already notices that when nVidia releases a new architecture, it's included in the upper half of the new series (GTX X50, X60, X70, X80) and AMD may have to try harder to win market share. They seriously need to stop rebranding. 
nvidia will catch up to AMD and release GTX 1000s with GTX 1050-1080 with HBM before AMD can put HBM on the rest of their own series :'(
Saying that retard is the proper medical term to refer to someone with a cognitive disability is like saying that negro is the proper term to refer to an African-American.  you would be right, if it was still the 1950s.
&gt; "preys upon human tendencies" as a problem, because that is essentially an immensely biased way of putting a negative spin on anything. There has hardly been a single successful video game in history that doesn't exploit human psychology.
Whilst that may be true, I just can't dismiss that people prey upon human psychology is a good thing. Is there some sort of balance that other person believe in? Eg. Oh, you can exploit people's greed but not their laziness? Where's the line to be drawn?
&amp;nbsp;
I wasn't really referring to anything in particular about the Frost thing, yes it is an issue - but I was going to put a small warning on it. If you do such a thing, please just put out what your going to do. People like security and stability, not things in limbo and uncertainty. Not just: Oh, it will open soon™.
Power Creep:
Again, it was just a reminder. Once I have written up this part I shall give multiple solutions that I have thought of. Of course, mine may/may not be viable, correct or otherwise and people shall either side with me, point out flaws or dismiss it all together - and that's fine, I'm not saying I'm the pinnacle and have the best ideas. I am hella flawed and this is certainly one of the biggest and possibly hardest problem to fix in Warframe. It will not be easy.
No, you are not coming off as a fanboy, defending is good, this is how solutions come to pass, I have flaws in my thinking - other people calling them out can fix them. This list has been in the making for a while, and only somewhat accelerated because of the Vaults being so shrouded in 'mystery' and the AFK detection system. I wish these vaults not to be a negative thing, so I am rushing to hopefully change things they have possibly considered.
I feel in gaming as well as politics, once law or changes have been made, they are quite hard to change or reverse, as we have seen with Viver. The community backlash was IMMENSE and had to be for a simple change.
Tl;dr
Preying upon people's "7 sins" is not cool in my book.
Power creep needs to be looked at, will consider your points - this was only a dot point and not fleshed out.
Void Vault is new, please tell your players EXACTLY how it will work not just hey guys, it's a surprise.
Because the goods don't exist, or you're not high enough of a priority to get them. This is assuming you unchecked the "automatic" box and have it set to buy. This happens a ton in multiplayer games, where the game will go through phases of shortages. There is always a machine parts storage at the start, an artillery shortage, and a canned food shortage. There is simply not enough iron in the world.

 just because you want to buy something doesn't mean it's in stock
Its based on practicing proactive medicine instead of reactive medicine.  Basically, you nip conditions early on and get them under control in order to hopefully avoid much more costly conditions in the future.
For example, a person has hypertension but does not see a doctor regularly because of cost or he sees a doctor but cannot afford his medication.  For a few decades he doesn't really notice any issues (hypertension takes a while to damage the body enough for symptoms to occur.)  In his 50s, the patient comes to the hospital with advanced kidney disease.  At this point, his hypertension has done irrepairable damage to his kidneys, and he has to undergo dialysis for the rest of his life unless he is lucky enough to match for a kidney transplant.
The cost that Medicare pays to providers per session for dialysis in my area is $138.  Someone in kidney failure should expect to go to a dialysis center between 2-3x a week.  You can see how the costs racks up pretty quick.  However, if the patient had been able to see his doctor for evaluations and gotten medication to control his hypertension, he could have possibly controlled his hypertension for around $122/year (linosopril is $6/mo and factor in annual visit with 50 copay for checkups).  It would cost less to control his medication for a year than go through one session of dialysis (only one of many possible complications from uncontrolled hypertension).
This highly oversimplifies how healthcare works, but I think the example holds. Let me know if I got something completely wrong or can clarify!
 it's way cheaper to give patients proactive care than deal with the consequences later.
Robin is one of three S-ranked units in my completely arbitrary Awakening character tier system.
Classic run wise: GOAT availability. You can design their caps and growths whichever way you want (though I am in agreement that Luck is Fire Emblem's dump stat). Access to any class that isn't unique like Lord/Taguel/Manakete/Villager. Gets two great abilities as a Tier 1 unit, and same upon promotion. Starting off as a Tactician ensures balanced growths.
Min max run: Robin's utility can be split into being a Galeforce master as a female version, or as a father that passes great stats down to potentially two kids. 
You can do nearly everything with Robin, so your imagination's your only limit.
PS: I went with a Hero MaMU paired with Sumia for first run, Grandmaster &gt; Dark Flier FeMU paired with Chrom for second run, and currently running Swordmaster MaMU paired with Lucina if you're curious.
These times are in game times not YouTube time marks.
That Strike to Alexander at 1:05 ish in the first.
Edit: Drop by Sim-Walker at the start of the second. Cost a TD on a beautiful pass.
Beautiful pass to TE at 9:47 in second dropped :(
4:55ish second the play by play guy is making jokes that Gibson made a routine catch and that is progress for these WR's.
At 2:00 minute warning for first half Rams are 1/7 on 3rd down and had a few yards to go get two false starts in a row. At this point Sam has a terrible completeion % and 60ish yards. 5 to 6 drops and 50 yards left on the field by WR's/TE's
10:55 in 3rd stays strong in face of pressure gets rocked delivers a decent pass droppped. At this point Aikeman wants to throw in the towel for Bradford.
10:13 4th Dropped TD on a great tight window throw. Second TD pass dropped this game. 9th drop by my count so far in this game. (I have a more liberal view of drops than most as in did it hit your hands? Yes = drop)
1:51:52 on the YouTube mark Aikeman says he feels bad for Bradford. I think Troy is ready to go down on the feidl and start murdering WR's/TE's and Lineman.

EAGLES FANS! lol look at 1:55:00 Time on the YouTube mark. Sam starts a fast paced hurry up offense. Starts murdering the Redskins Defense with amazing passes and quick Decisions.
5:50 left in the game Lance Kendricks drops a 3rd droppped TD. This pass was a little off the mark this time.
Even after reliving that horrible horrible offense we could have still won that game. A lot of passes droppped three TD's left on the ground. We even were down by 7 in scoring position with a few minutes left in the game and NO WR could even come close to open back to back times and Sam gets hit. 
TSummary Sam was balling out hard and had 0 help from his team all game.
I don't disagree with this idea, but implementation is the part that makes me hesitate.  Categorization is a complicated beast that is prone to opinionated bias.  
Let me give you a for instance:
For many, many, many years (months?  years?  a lot of time) I have been hugely disappointed that Mass Effect won RPG of the Year over Borderlands.  Mass Effect has some RPG elements, but in my opinion (Notice opinion) was just a shadow of an example of the RPG genre compared to Borderlands, which even there is not my first choice when thinking of an RPG example.  
Even in a genre that should be extremely broad, like Incremental Games, there is a lot of opinion as to what should or should not be placed in that category.  If I said that Borderlands was an Incremental, most people (myself included) would cry shenanigans.  However, at the most literal definition, you are earning money and experience that you use to improve your character so that you can fight stronger enemies and gain more money and experience.
Back on the original topic.  I don't really see how we could easily sub-categorize incremental games with a great deal of opinion.  People would say that Tap Titans in virtually the same as Clicker Heroes and Tap Tap Infinity.  However, Tap Titans is mobile, Clicker Heroes is web based and Tap Tap Infinity is both.  AdVenture Capitalist has a lot of the same elements and Clicking Bad and Idle Oil Tycoon, but I wouldn't say they are anything even close to the same game or the same category.
What I would love to see (And now that I think about it, I don't know why I wouldn't do it myself) is an Incremental Review Site or Blog.  If such a thing exists, would could provide links in the Ultimate List to the game's review and let people draw their own conclusions as to what game it is similar to and if they want to give it a try.
Just my two copper pieces.  Take it for what you will.
 Good idea, but maybe hard to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I know there's a lot of pointed disinterest in this idea, but it's not a bad one at all. The point isn't wether or not there are active developers or if "they are all incremental games". The problem is that *incremental* isn't a genre in the *gameplay* sense, but in the *mechanics* sense. If someone asks you what "type of game" something is and you say *platformer*, how are they going to know you mean Maplestory and not Super Meatboy? If you had said "mmo" or "arcade" instead, it would have made a lot more sense from the beginning not only what you were talking about, but also gives them context for if they want to check it out, or understand discussion about it. That's becasue "mmo" and "arcade" aren't related to mechanics, they are related to gameplay style, and one can instantly have a base idea for what the viewpoint, setting, mechanics, graphics, and gui are probably going to be like, which is the point entirely.
MY PROPOSAL:
Consider that a dark room is COMPLETELY different than cookie clicker, but is still "incremental". Describing a title with a simple preexisting subgenre would be both instantly understandable and very useful...
* Cookie clicker clicking bad, adventure capitalist, swarm simulator (games whose purpose is to aquire resources first and foremost, to prestige, to upgrade production speed): *tycoon incremental*
* A dark room, kittens game, critter mound, (an expanding population with complex needs, war and exploration): *civ incremental*
* A dark room, candy box, ect (upgrades are used to get better stats in minigames and unlock new play styles, ect): *rpg incremental*
Some games have both civ and rpg elements, specifically thinking of a dark room, which could be called a civ/rpg incremental. However, since *all* incrementals have tycoon elements, "tycoons incrementals" would simply be all games that don't deviate from the base model by including other elements.
~~just my two cents have a great day~~
**** Just use the same genres used in other game types.
&gt; Let's use some numbers here. Say you get an 80 watt speaker and you hook that up to the 40 watt PA you have. It's not loud enough so you start pushing the amplifier harder. Pretty soon you're clipping.
That isn't how it works at all.  It is perfectly safe to run 500W speakers at 1W for ever, in fact my horn loaded cabs are so efficient that if they saw more than 100 - 200W they would be far too loud for most local venues and they are loaded with 500W drivers.
You will get clipping if you try and get more power out of an amplifier than it provides or you can do some serious damage if you present a lower load to your amp than it can handle 2ohm load on most shitty amps will drive them way too hard.
Using some numbers you could make an enclosure that was say 100dB/W/m loaded with for arguments sake a 800W driver.  You could hook that up to a 1W SET valve amp and get about 100dB out of it, for every doubling of power you will get an extra 3dB.
&gt;The jist of it is, you want to compare the peak or instantaneous power ratings of speakers,
You do not want to do this at all.  Only look at RMS rates.  Another example, I run two subs loaded with 600W 8ohm drivers in parallel which presents a 4ohm load (actually around 3 becasue of the horn loading but that's another post entirely).  That is an RMS rating which matters, the manufacturer could do what car audio guys love and slap a 1.8kW max on that because they don't mean anything.  I power these subs with 49V RMS because I know that is here they approach xmax in their passband.  I run them with a 1200W RMS amp and I can run that close to full power which gives me plenty of headroom and as long as the compressors do their job no risk.
tl,dr; You will be fine, power is simply a product of voltage and impedance and the number of watts a speaker sees from an amplifier is directly related to these.  When a speaker is playing softly it is obviously receiving fewer volts since it's impedance stays the same (it actually varies based on frequency but once again whole other post).  This means that in practice your speakers will be seeing far fewer watts than your amp can put out at most times, I have 10W hifi speakers and run them with a 3W SET amp and at most times they would even be getting 0.1W because they are ridiculously efficient.
Alright, so here I'm gonna go being a bit "dumb" as Josh would say, and a bit of a "neckbeard" as Matt would call me. Triangle didn't float my boat, so to speak. I didn't think it was bad, but I personally didn't derive much enjoyment from it. The beginning sequence in which she's growing more angry with her child, then throws her stained dress into a large duffle bag and then shows up childless to the docks felt like they were telegraphing "what a tweest" five minutes in. Admittedly, I assumed this meant she'd killed her kid in a fit of rage. Once it got into the time stuff, I thought it was pretty cool that the it wasn't just one causality loop, but two nested inside a larger one, but there were a bunch of plot holes that frustrated me like her being able to hide from her future self, the selective replication of looped objects, and the fact that there are two copies of her OUTSIDE her own loop. If you do the math on the boat, she passes through three stages of boarding, trying to change, then becoming gunman. In the boarding stage she fights the gunman she eventually becomes, but in the change phase she encounters a version of herself she never becomes, and who is engaged in a similar but ostensibly counter-point cyclical loop. This suggests to me that not only is there here double loop nested in the larger one, but a parallel loop that crosses her's without ever actually being her's. Finally, the woman we meet in the beginning who abuses her child, answers the doorbell, and gets hammered to death isn't even in any loop at all as the woman who shows up at the docks is the one who killed her and has been in a loop this whole time. I guess what I'm saying is it's cool when you get time copies of people, but this movie had copies that weren't temporally derived from each other, like alternate reality twins or something. Overall I'd say the movie was well shot, had some interesting concepts, and for the amount of time-wackiness it bit off, held it together pretty well, but ultimately it fell flat for me. I'd rate it like a 6/10 and probably wouldn't be averse to suggesting it to people if they were into time-wackiness.  
Edit:  I'm dumb and/or a neckbeard, I thought Triangle was meh.
Armors would be cool. Something for us to revisit once we've revamped our characters (since for Armors to be cool, they've gotta show up on your character!).
We'd likely do this by reformatting a lot of our passives into the four classic armor slots (hands, legs, body, helmet), and limiting you to one of each per run.
This'd be a solid way to add lots of classic MM flavor, and I can think of how we'd tie it into the narrative.
- I'd love to do this -- can't promise it just yet, though.
That's such a nice story :) I'm glad you had a good time.
I went to see Coheed and Cambria a couple of years back and as much as I enjoyed them, the 2nd support act blew me away. They're called Arcane Roots, the singer came onto the stage in a suit, the band set up and then he just started going insane (in a good way). He was leaping around the stage, so into the music. By the end, he'd lost his jacket, was soaked through with sweat (it was a red/black suit, so the fact that I could even see the sweat should tell you how into it this guy was) and you'd probably have a hard time saying there were same guy if you saw a before and after picture.
Oddly enough, that same year I went to see Fozzy and got far more into both of the support acts, Voodoo Vegas and Breed 77. I ended up talking to every member of those bands while hanging at the bar while Fozzy were on stage. They are all so nice. It was also Breed's last tour gig before they announced their new singer, who sang one of the songs with them at the gig I went to. I went up to him after the gig and told him how great he was, it blew my mind when they announced he was the new singer!
Gigs are awesome, never underestimate the support acts.
After playing for awhile I don't think it's the learning curve that turns people away.  It's isolation.  If you stay in the safe part of the game staring at mining lasers and running your hundredth mission its just not fun.  I'm fairly confident you give most MMO palyers the chance to get out interacting with people and socializing they will be much more likely to stick around.
Hi-sec sucks get out as soon as you can.
Haha! Love this!  As a former radio/TV broadcast professional, I can fill you in on what the button actually means.  PTY is an abbreviation for "**P**rogram **TY**pe", and CAT is an abbreviation for "**CAT**egory."  (This isn't the same as HD radio - this only applies to analog FM radio broadcasts.)  Some FM radio stations broadcast RDS (Radio Data System) information that shows information about the station such as program type category (Country, Rock, Alternative), radio text (station name/song title &amp; artist currently playing/request line info., etc.), traffic information, and call letters such as KIIS or WDAY. 
*** - The **P**rogram **TY**pe **CAT**egory button lets you find FM radio stations that have the program type you're wanting to listen to (such as Country, Rock, Alternative).
Removing the words "A Hideo Kojima Production" and crediting Konami sounds like a stupid idea considering the average fan of their franchises' opinion of the company. Who actually buys products because they are Konami? I'm not up on all their franchises but MGS and SH seem like the only ones still going. Unless Dance Dance Revolution is still a thing? If it is I am sure the fans give zero fucks that Konami is behind it, if they even know. Such is Konami and their control issues though, this may be their first step into failure. I imagine whatever happens, Kojima will be better off without them
 FUCK KONAMI!!!
Fair point. Although, I mostly meant "learning" as "first year of driving," rather than as "first week of driving." Heck, I've driven for 9 years, and I still feel like I'm learning. I drive as cautiously as possible, always use my signals, make no sudden moves, and try to predict the actions of others, but the road can still offer new situations that you need to learn to navigate safely.
 I wouldn't want anyone outside of my family in the first year of driving to drive my car, much less someone in the first week of driving. That's the reason most people learn in a family member's car, I think.
When I was still wet behind the ears I got a job washing dishes at the ritziest place in the city. Our head Chef (we'll call him Steve) studied in France and won a few awards in his career.
 We also had a prestigious cooking college in town so every year we'd take a handful of culinary students for some on-the-job training so they could get their hours to graduate and out of every dozen students who came through I'd say that maybe one had what it took to survive in a kitchen. This was Steve's opinion as well. I'd catch Steve muttering or talking to the regular staff about how these kids are no damn good and don't want to work.
Fast forward a few months and I end up doing some prep work and managed to cook a few meals on the line during slow periods. No culinary student was hired.
Long story short, years later I was handpicked by Steve to work at his son's newly opened restaurant. 
So yeah, any chef who's been around awhile certainly values a hard worker and a quick learner over a piece of paper. I would recommend getting a culinary text book so you have a good working knowledge of the base techniques and apply to places with a menu you're comfortable with. 
 Good chances. It happens all the time.
&gt;Interestingly enough throughout the series Toby gets made more and more boring and flat out unlikeable.
hmmm intertesting
&gt;He writes a series of crime novels
There is more to this. Let's go down this rabbit hole shall we?
So a very boring man who write crime novels, as his only source of escape. Consider also that he has unrequited feelings for Pam. Maybe he could win her over? Nope she got married. His little girl? Nope won't talk to him. The promise of Costa Rica? Gone. How is it that someone like Michael Scott has been in more relationships than him?! Toby masks his pain by delving ever deeper into his first passion and the only thing that comforts him now. Writing his crime novels. Still he yearns for human interaction, for intimacy. How is Michael getting so lucky? Why did Pam reject him?! The pain is too much. He redoubles his efforts on writing but the more he writes the more he yearns for affection.  Slowly the two merge into one. The result? Murder. The method? Only one of the most personal ways. Strangulation. 
Toby doesn't lose his mind, he merely gives into his desires. He begins strangling the life out of others and this makes him feel *alive* he picks out a sweet mild mannered girl. Tracks her activies and attacks her during a nightly jog. Toby has gotten arrogant, he didn't notice the bystander. There is a brawl, but Toby manages to run away. As the bystander is checking the body and reaching into his pocket to get his cell phone a cop pulls up. The bystander tries to explain what happened, but it's too late, she's dead. Strangled. Cut down in the primer of her life. Mr. Bystander is arrested on suspicion of murder.  
Proving that fate is indeed ironic Toby is selected for jury duty. Overcome with rage Mr. Bystander lashes out at Toby and tries to strangle him.
**Toby is the Scranton Strangler** 
Fuck you for leaving.  I almost wish you were dead, because at least then I could have closure.  You were our coach, our rock, our *dad*, and then you just fucked off like we were nothing to you.  I understand you're "sorry" but that doesn't fix that you hurt us and I don't trust you anymore.  My brothers and I being adults doesn't mean you can treat us like we're nothing to you now that we're no longer naive and chubby cheeked.  You claim you left because of mom's passive aggressive emotional abuse, but you fail to understand that you left *us* in the crossfire of her worst behavior yet.  You painted a huge target on us for her emotional and verbal abuse and left us no support when we needed it most.  You pretend everything is okay and we've forgiven you but we never did and probably never will.  I was asked if I would let you see my future children and I said I didn't know.  Before I would have loved for them to hear your stupid tales of baseball and pranks, but now I wouldn't want them to deal with your toxic bullshit.
 Dad, you were my everything, and now I'm not even inviting you to my college graduation.  You don't deserve to be part of my life anymore.
Shannon, one of my closest friends for years after bumping into her at the pizza place that her foster parents owned. We used to walk around for miles in every direction from town, talk a lot, and waste time on the weekends doing literally nothing. She began to fall into a bad crowd with smoking, drugs, etc, after she got molested by some creep who pretended to be her uncle. He manipulated her, and her foster parents didn't give a shit. I was the only other person than her who testified when the police came over and made a video record because I was 12 and couldn't go to court. Her life ended up fucked because nobody really cared about her, and at one point I was her only friend, around this time you kept telling me to stay away from her and get her out of my life because "she was a bad influence on me". I always disagreed under the logic "I am a good influence on her". Eventually you got what you wanted though, I did push her away, and I did "focus on my schoolwork". She tried to commit suicide after her foster parents kicked her out, and I haven't heard from her since she asked me for help the day before her attempt. I abandoned one of my closest friends when they needed me most because you told me to. 
To conclude, I just want you to stop shouting all the time, stop hitting me, and for the first time in both of our lives maybe accept me for who I am. I'm not a bad kid, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs - I just sit at home enjoying myself with games, or go out to the weekly mtg tournament on the train. I don't want to be scared of you, and you getting more and more angry because I'm scared doesn't solve anything. The entire family needs serious therapy. I want to sit in the same room as you without risking my self and what I enjoy because you might explode. I want you to stop acting like you're the best parent in the world because of how much stuff you've bought - I don't want money, I want love. All the money just goes into hobbies you hate anyway, mostly mtg cards.
I just want to be happy. 
Mom, i hate your personality. With a burning fiery passion. You always think the world revolves around you and want nothing but the best when you put ZERO work towards your "best". Don't get me wrong. I do love you, but some days i wish you would shut the fuck up and realize that the world is not yours.
Dad, Some days your a fucking dick, other days your an awesome dad, i just wish that your cool side was always there. I don't know how you and my mother got together, she is such the polar opposite from you. But hey, without her i wouldn't be around. 
All in all, I do love my parents, its just there flaws that stand out so much to me and it just pisses me off. But i have flaws as well. I love my family. I just can't stand being around them. They don't really pay any attention to what i say and are usually assholes about it when i don't speak very often around them. But that's only because they don't listen to me. When ever i come home from a long day at school. I always want to tell them about my day. But i'm ignored. My dad uses his god damn tablet that he never puts down and my mom is always on her phone. When ever they want me to spend "family time" with them. They are always glued to there screens. Then when i pull out my phone i get bitched at. 
I always spend my time in my room or out with friends. They always complain that i'm never around. I always want to speak up and tell them why. But my parents always have a way to flip my words and make me seem like the ass. 
My relationship has gotten better with my parents as i grow older but the ignoring aspect didn't really go away, Hopefully it gets better. I do love my family. I just can't stand them some days.
tl;dr
Parents ignore me at home, complain when i don't talk to them

Stacia is actually a troll whose mind has been destroyed by Sopor Slime
Proof: The incoherent design of the story as well as the lack of capitals appear to be a typing quirk, and the odd events such as the misfortune with the fire mixed with the almost "Soap Opera" like drama are likely due to the fear that is created in her own world via drinking the [Sopor Slime]( from the Recuperacoon
&gt; "It is stated that submergement into Sopor Slime aides sleep and helps "assuage the terrible visions of blood and carnage that plague the dark subconscious of [their] species". These terrible visions may be a result of the subjugglator's psychic powers." 
It seems likely that Stacia's partial hallucination on events has lead her to believe in her fears such as the fire. These manifestations are essentially how troll society has pacified to the point at which she has embraced the imaginary school life which she lives in as her own, and as she has grown partial immunity to the slime, her thoughts have become more incoherent and her mind has fallen victim to the fantasy world she has created around the Homestuck cast. In a similar way to how Calliope engages herself with the narrative of Homestuck (Through texts), Stacia has engaged herself with the characters themselves.
 Stacia is a troll who drinks from her recuperacoon, and is suffering the effects of Sopor Slime consumption, and I just read 19 pages of the worst fanfiction I will ever read.

no it doesnt, yes you would get 10 chestersons instead of 5, giving you double the money. but it also doubles your prestige time losing a lot of artifacts/hour.  
lets say you kill 10 chestersons without WI , gives you 10 x base gold
killing 10 with WI means 5 x base and 5 x base+1level. since you kill next level chestersons they will drop more gold. and you can simply not kill a boss and grind chestersons for days if you want to. 
  
  
no you will not get more money you will actually get less
I have the same or a similar problem.  Definitely check your form and don't push yourself, because you will pull/tear something and it will keep you from squatting/deadlifting/moving in general.  Put me out of commission for about two months.
Along with all the other suggestions, what helped me was deloading and ensuring my form was perfect - trying a whole lot of tiny changes in my foot placement until I found the position that helped my glutes engage and took the stress off the inner thigh.  
Another biggie - depth.  I figured out I was forcing myself lower than my mobility allowed, causing my glutes to lose tension and placing a whole lot of stress on those weaker muscles in the groin/inner thigh.  I just go to parallel now and it's extraordinary the difference it's made.  Maybe not as impressive as ATG but I'll take injury-free lifting over that any day of the week.
So this turned into a tl; dr - Form.  Depth.  Don't push yourself.
You're gonna need a partner who doesn't mind getting sextra close during your squat. Have them lay down, face up underneath you; then drop trough and perform your squat. If your butthole is tight going down, loosens at the bottom, and tightens going back up, you have buttwink. 
Don't be a loose butthole.
Thanks! 
There goes my master plan for ultra ganz.. 
 you die.
So I've kind of run out of options.
I have issues with my right shoulder - lack of ROM and pain in certain positions.  I am certain I have throwers shoulder, as I was a thrower in high school and never did anything to counter this.
I went to the doctor, they examined and X-Rayed me, and said nothing was wrong with my shoulder.  I went to another doctor, they examined my shoulder and the X-Rays and said "structurally your shoulder is fine."  My insurance will not cover a different opinion because of doctor shopping, and my doctor said that if I still had pain in *2 months* that she would schedule an MRI for me.
Yet they ignore that I've told them that if I preform as few as 6 forceful throws my arm starts to go numb (so likely my muscle is being impinged in the extreme range of motion).
 So do I just fucking deal with it or could I, with little risk, attempt to fix my shoulder myself?  I can't wait 2 months.
To clarify the ROM I'm missing: if I attempt to do the behind the back hands touching stretch, my right arm cannot reach my left shoulder blade without forcibly being moved that, and it will go numb if left there.
Did you physically have the baby, or did your wife? I have an 8 month old (I'm the dad) and I feel you either way. I kept with it, but my intensity wasn't there. Just don't stop... ever. Something is better than nothing, and within a few months you'll be back in full swing. My wife on the other hand, she basically had to take off for about 7 months or so and is just getting back into the groove of things. 
TL:DR; if you're the dad, stick with it, don't expect mad gainz, just workout to maintain. If you're the mom, good luck, you'll have to wait it out :(
If you take Whey Protein you don't really need BCAAs. Creatine is a great supplement, just drink lot's of water and don't spend a lot. Basic Creatine Monhydrate is super cheap from Optimum and other places and doesn't require loading. The only other supplements to take are maybe a multi, fish oil, and I've had good results with Glutamine for recovery (it's also super cheap). Other than that there aren't many supplements that are worth the money.
 **** Protein, Creatine, multi+fish oil and maybe Glutamine. That's pretty much the standard for supplement stacks
**Honestly, I'd just go with the era you like the look of the most.**
If you want Medieval then go for Medieval 2. It's probably my favourite game in the series and it's got a pretty active and fantastic modding community. As with the original Rome you'd think they're pretty dated but they're still both very playable and you'd hardly notice their age when you get into it. However neither of these seem to be in the sale.
Shogun 2 is arguably the most solid in the series and has a very good multiplayer community. There isn't much in terms of unit variety though and the campaign map is pretty small. Definitely the best if you want to zoom in on the battlefield, you see lots of action going on between the units. It's a pretty good game to enter the series in personally.
If you want an early modern period then your best bet is either Empire, Napoleon or Fall of the Samurai. Empire is pretty buggy and glitchy but has the largest campaign map of all of the Total War games. Napoleon is a smaller scale version of Empire but is a much more refined and solid game than Empire. Fall of the Samurai is the only in the series I haven't played, if somebody could shed some light on this one, please tell me.
Rome 2 and Attila are the newest in the series. Rome 2 had a rocky release but is a very solid game. They play a little bit differently to the earlier games in the series but are still incredibly fun to play, I would say Attila is the most difficult in the series and definitely keeps you on edge through the whole campaign.
** Shogun 2 or Napoleon for solid, Attila or Rome 2 for newest, Empire for largest scale.**
Viktor got a huge rework before becoming FOTM, and kennen's w got changed before he was good in competitive again too. Diana is being seen mostly because xiye brought it out in iem katowice and faker brought it out in lck last night. 
koreans usually figure out the op champs first after they get changed, then other regions just copy the koreans
I feel compelled to say this bc I've never seen this argument made, downvotes be damned. 
Have you ever tried using an autotuner? You actually have to be pretty close on pitch initially for an auto tuner to correct it onto key without hearing an awful glitch. You have to be even closer to on pitch to add an autotuner and not even perceive that it's been applied. 
This is for singing of course. In a nutshell (from a soundwave point of view) the difference between singing and speaking is that singing utilizes single pitches or frequencies, while speaking uses multiple frequencies with no pitch. Which is why you can speak over any song and it sounds "on key" 
The way autotune works is that it forces whatever signal it receives into a single pitch, meant for singing. When applying autotune to a multiple frequencies, such as speaking or rapping, the autotune gets confused and the result is the glitchiness that a lot of people (myself included) find annoying. 
Rappers that use autotune are doing so purely for style however annoying that style might be. The argument that autotune implies a lack of talent bc it allows the computer to do all of the work is flawed bc any speaking/rapping no matter how good when run through an autotune will all sound the way you are familiar with. 

This all depends on what you'd actually be doing for them, which you're not very specific about. If this type of job is offered to industrial engineers versus say business analysts, I suspect it may come with some level of hands on project management, or possibly some process/automation engineering. Compared with a typical industrial engineer grad, you may be lacking a few skills that they have some training with, but in my experience, you'd both need to learn on the job anyway, so you realistically won't be far behind. Excel, Access, and other MS office stuff is pretty much a requirement for anyone doing anything related to business data. Possibly AutoCAD or similar if you end up doing any layout projects. You won't know some terms and jargon, but you could pick that up pretty quick. Speaking for myself and others I know in supply chain/logistics-majority of us had to learn quite a bit at the first job and still do as we move around the industry. FWIW a colleague of mine has a ChemE degree and has been in this industry for many years now. My degree doesn't exactly relate either, but is technical.
It's probably not a big deal, they'll be training you to do what they need you to do
i cannot remember anything of countdown to final crisis but the ending, and something about Lobo worshipping a fish...
-MASSIVE SPOILERS-
Basicly, throughout the whole series, Booster had been making progressively more of an ass of himself, loosing sponsors left right and center, while a mysterious hero actually did his job. Halfway through the series, he manages in very unheroic fashion, to get himself killed trying to disgrace that other hero (think his name was supernova or something). Booster was buried with an empty funeral. His sidekick whose name escapes me, figures the world needs more heroes since all the old school ones disappeared (again), so he tracks down Boosters great great great granddad, who was supposed to be some great humanitarian worker.
#
Well, Booster forefather turns out to be a lazy slob, who used to be a highschool superstar athlete/ameri-football player, fucked up in a major game and decided to spent the rest of his life smoking pot. So boosters sidekick trying to turn him into Booster Gold 2.0, goes about as well as you might expect.
Well towards the end it turns out that boosters little gold ball of a sidekick is actually trying to blow up the timestream because reasons, but right before he can turn on the universe-end-a-tron-3000, he is foiled by supernova, who reveals himself to be Booster gold who had faked his own death (and did some light time travel). Unfortunately the universe-end-a-tron-3000 is still active and tearing holes in the universe, so Boosters great great and so forth, yells to booster: "go long" (or some similar ameri-football phrase), booster throws the universe-end-a-tron-3000 to him who jumps into a blackhole/volcano (and somehow survives - something about the timestream correcting itself -.-).
The reason it was so great, was because it was because it was both a great story of redemption (for Booster great great great etc.), and it gave a great perspective on Booster (when given the choice between sacrificing himself for others, or enjoying the #based life, he chose  sacrifice without second thoughts)
why he needed to ruin his reputation and fake his own death is a whole different story, which boils down to needing a way to work against his supercomputer sidekick without it being suspicious against him and ruining the plan, which could only be done if the sidekick truly believed him to be death/allowed him to die. i could go on but i've already passed the 2400 character mark...
This one goes out to the boys in blue and gold!
Now since i couldnt decide which game to give a review for, i'd like to write my three favourite games, in no particular order as they're mostly different genders.
* First of all, [MAG]( from the PS3.
MAG was a multiplayer FPS with no single player mode. It set in a future where all conflicts were resolved by military contractors (Not a very exciting history) with three playable factions, S.V.E.R., Raven and Valor, the player at the creation of a character was asked to choose between these, SVER had close range weapons that had a load of damage but not too much precision, Raven had long range weapons with not as much damage as SVER but very high precision and Valor got the middle range with stats somewhere in between. 
What made MAG shine was it's gamemodes, with the smallest one being 32 vs 32 and the biggest one being an all out 128 vs 128 gamemode with multiple tiers of objectives and multiple leaderships, all these persons were divided in platoons of 32 people each, which were subdivided in squads of 8 people each, each squad, team, and platoon had a leader with special abilities (selected randomly) these leaders could call defensive strikes, offensive strikes (assuming the anti air defenses were down), whole sattelite sweeps which showed everyone on the map and talk to their whole platoon or in the case of the OIC (leader of the team in that match) to all 4 platoons and to the individual leaders.
With such massive gamemodes, the winner was often determined by teamwork, and even in these massive battlefields, each soldier was important due to the number of bullets required to kill someone (Differing here from CoD). A headshot would kill someone in about 3 or 4 hits, where body shots would need up to 15 hits depending on the tier of armor you were wearing (I'll come back to this soon), a single man could take entire squads with enough skill, while it required a team to hold a point due to the massive amount of people that would be coming to protect it.
Another highlight of MAG would be the different possible loadouts, each player could choose what kind of armor he could wear, however, heavier armor makes you slower and unable to carry as much, a medkit or a repair kit would have the same restrictions, and lighter armor would actually make you faster.
Last but not least, the vehicles, when attacking, 2 of the squadrons of each them had an APC (Think of a tank, but not as durable) while defending teams had powered humvees, to contrarrest these vehicles soldiers could equip RPGs or keep blockades up (which would count as another objective as they needed to be blown up using c4 in the typical fashion) These vehicles were often forward spawns for squadrons that had them and made them very valuable as they could pack quite a punch.
Overall, i think MAG was the best FPS i've ever played and there's so many things i couldnt write due to lack of space that i recommend you to see an actual review or video of it, it definitely ruined other FPS for me.
* For the second game, the obligatory [Portal 2](
Im not going to tell you everything about this game like i did with MAG, instead, i must only say that it's a change from most of the games i've played that involved fun new mechanics in what it's basically a puzzle solving game, the flawless historyline combined with the mechanics of thinking with portals make this game one of the best i've ever played. Not to mention the amazing graphics and the fact that it runs on nearly anything thanks to the source engine.
Shall you go through it on multiplayer, you'll find yourself murdering your companion through different methods while Glados awards each of you Science collaboration points through an history made for two robots.
Shall you go through it on single player you'll find yourself alternating between laugh, amazement and other emotions that you didnt know you had as you continue exploring Arperture Science in it's magnificent ambience.
Overall, if you're looking for something different than other single player campaign games, portal is for you.
* Last but not least, it is [Resistance: Fall of Man]( another PS3 exclusive:
This starts as the typical FPS campaign (With co-op if you prefer it!), as you become an American soldier who comes to Europe to aid in an advanced alien invasion (I'll try not to spoil too much of the history) and go through the ranks trying your best to discover the "source" of the "invasion" that started somewhere in europe.
What distinguishes this game from others is the weapons, being alien weapons they get very special shots, like a sniper that slows time, a gun that can shoot trackers, a magnum that can make it's shoots implode, with a variety of different enemies, there's plenty of things to test your special weapons on and the addition of co-op really adds to the cake.
While i also loved Resistance 2 and 3, i feel that the first one is the best due to the original weapons and nostalgia. You'll love it.
Thanks for reading.

 The MAG one is long because i had to explain the game, but portal 2 and resistance arent THAT long, so go read those (or dont, im a piece of text not a cop)
Dishonored  
Dishonored was the first stealth game which made me love the genre. before I was stuck in Call of duty land and other first person where the world was closed but dishonored offered everything what a single player should do.  
Game play. 
Game play was awesome in my opinion. each map was so big and free roam with plenty of things to do. there were side quests and different ways of entering a building. you can either infiltrate or just keep climbing util you get to your destination. the side quests had it's own story and which was still interesting and helped you in your single mission. I also loved the stealth mechanics as it was challenging and fun. the fighting mechanics were fairly good and we had multiple weapons and power that meant which we had the power to whether kill or just knock out the opponent.  or chop is head down and take it where ever you want him to be.
Graphics.  
I really liked the oil painting style of the game and the game still looks beautiful even now when we played it. the scenery was amazing and we could spend time taking screenshots of the plague rotten dun wall.  
Story. 
Although the story was short but with the vast open area to explore was good. the story was interesting. moreover the side quests and story of dun wall was also amazing, and it felt like the game could be even good without the main story it self. with multiple ending which depended how you treated you're opponents.  
Powers.  
I just loved the powers and just now simply wish I had the powers in real life too.  with blinking to bending time or mind controlling other was simply a joyful experience.  
In contrast Dishonored was an amazing game and had much to offer. even tho the game was short but the amount of time people spent was too much. I myself have finished the game 5 times and wishing that more games get like this. with side quests and a open world to explore which might help us on our journey. even tho I pirated the game I still feel like giving the dev double the money for creating this game. people gave it 9.2/10 or 8/10 I would give it a 15/10 a must play. Bethesda usually makes addictive games from skyrim to just a single player dishonored. this game is a brath taking one.    
  
-Great graphics- with oil painting style
-vast open world
-Multiple ways to get to your destination  
-Interesting side quest  
-Good stealth mechanics  
-Nice combat system.  
-Blood and glore   
-Good story  
-15/10  
The game I want:  
I would love GTA 5 through steam since I have been interested in that game for a long time. with all sand box experience. I would love to get the game but sadly it got banned in my country because of drug reference and violence I would love to get this game.  
Here is my steam id:   
P.s sorry for my grammar and shitty explaining And thanks for the giveaway! Good luck to all the opponents :)
I used to have a blog about indie games so I'll try and translate my first ever review as best as I can: 
&gt; Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if the fate of humanity was in the hands of a young girl? No? Well Daniel Remar the creator of Iji sure did. And he answered that question beautifully in the form of a sidescroller shooter-RPG.
&gt; Trying not to spoil the story I will mention only that the plot of the game revolves around an alien invasion,a scientific complex and of course our heroine Iji.
&gt; The art  style is quite simplistic yet you can tell a lot of thought and work went into it. The background sceneries are quite beautiful and really give you the feel of whats happening outside of the complex during the invasion. Graphics somewhat remind me of Flashback or even Another World and other platformers from a bigone era.
&gt; The story is told through short cutscenes, data logs scattered throughout the levels of the game and Iji's communication with other members of the human race, mainly her brother.
The gameplay is, (and I say this with all the weight of the term) old school , in the spirit of Metroid , with lots of walking around, discovering new areas, upgrading weapons, etc. The weapons themselves offer some variety although they are pretty much the standard arsenal for a game including aliens : machinegun, shotgun , grenade and melee attack (in this case a kick). The variety comes from the fact that you are able to use both human and alien weapons, as well as unlock and upgrade different abilities and powers. This is done in strategically positioned upgrade stations and used as currency are nano bots which you can collect from defeated enemies.
&gt; Overall this is a game that I highly recommend, not only because its probably the best of Daniel Remars work but because it is great fun, and its low requirements guarantee hours of entertainment on even the weakest PC.
&gt; The game can be [downloaded for free]( from Remars web page and as an extra you can download a high quality soundtrack.

As for a hate review , that's a little tougher for me , cause my philosophy is "there are no good or bad games , just games that a lot of people like , and games that fewer people like" but I think my recent disappointment with GTA San Andreas' steam version qualifies.
&gt; I have held back on writing a review about this but I shall be silent no more!
&gt; Note that this is a review or the CURRENT steam version of the game .
&gt; All right R* you effed up , and you effed up hard. Here I was , thinking that the whole idea of patches was to make a game better. Instead what do we get? Lower resolutions , black screen freezes and dubious controller support. Wow , thanks I guess, I'll just mod it for 1080p and to use analog triggers for gas/brake on my 360 controller. What is that R*? I cant? Your brilliant state of the art update made all the mods incompatible? Well at least I still can listen to the great soundtrack. What? I cant do that either? You have removed some of the best songs because you were too stingy to pay royalties?
&gt; IRONY ALERT: 
CJ actually sings fragments of some of the removed songs when left idle ("You dropped a bomb on me" for instance )
R* advertise the PC version of GTA 5 having 160 songs more than the console version and at the same time they remove songs from the other game in the series set in the same city.
&gt; On a more personal note:
I bought this game in hopes of reliving my adolescent years but I guess that was too much to ask for. I have been stuck on Fender Ketchup mission for a while. If you are familliar with it you'll know that you have to drive dangerously while a mobster is tied to the hood of your car in order to scare the living bejeezus out of him. The problem however is the scare-o-meter fills up but nothing happens. That is if the mission starts at all , most of the time the game just freezes when walking into the mission blip or the casino that you need to enter to get to the mission blip.
&gt;  Not modable, less songs , glitches and freezes. Dont buy this , in its current state this is like a beta version of the game we used to know and love. We are paying the same amount of money for less content , which hardly seems fair.
I will be entering for Styx , which I posted a [request]( for not too long ago , or if you are feeling extra generous Shadow of Mordor maybe?
[Steam ID](
For Maya, you don't have to be support at ALL!
Look at a build like [this](
First off, there are only TWO survivability skills (sweet release and inertia) and from my experience, they are MORE than fine!
Second of all, notice how I have converge + sub-sequence + ruin + suspension + wreck + chain reaction. That allows me to 1. slag everything, 2. put a lot of singularities everywhere, 3. have the ultimate form of crowd control, 4. gain MASSIVE DPS increase (wreck) whenever I have something phase locked, 5. kill MANY enemies within one phaselock (usually around 3), 6. bounce off bullets everywhere when I have something phase locked, which means even more DPS and crowd control ability.
And also notice how I don't have a single skill that helps others. Maya, while being the best support class, is also arguably the best solo class (and one of the easier classes to play as).
***: Maya isn't tied down to support role. She can DPS crazy shit.
If you're trolling then you don't need to make a long post about how you were trolling: that just makes you look like even more of an idiot than before, just also one trying to save face because they have no spine.
 git gud
I don't even play PS2 anymore, someone give me  a TLDR. What did I miss?
If the headline read "Chemists claim to have solved **a** riddle of how life began on Earth", then it seems like it would be correct.
It's possible that they were planning on putting that "a" there but forgot, or it's also possible that they deliberately left the "a" out so that it can still have that meaning, but it also looks more impressive and thus entices more people to click the article because it could also mean "Chemists claim to have solved **the** riddle of how life began on Earth".
 It's either a typo or clickbait.
The most accurate timeline would depend on the hormone levels and body chemistry of the individual along with their knowledge, experience and psychological profile on the topic.  
  Go through the cycle a few times with someone, observe and take notes would be your best chart forward. 
gt; it's different for each of us. 
They don't quite dice it up into little pieces, but I'm pretty sure its a lot closer to that than simply removing it from the womb. And by the right to life, I mean the right to not be killed specifically, I said the right to life because I hear that phrase so much that its easy to just slip into it. But yeah, its the right to not be killed (part of the greater right to not have force initiated against you) which is the a tual right, not simply to life.
 I misspoke, right to life means right to not be killed.
So I am not an expert, but something about the piece jumped out to me very clearly. The author's reasoning for why climate change is not dangerous is that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been higher at some other point in time and that plants consume carbon dioxide, so higher levels of CO2 should be beneficial to them.
Both of these may be true, but the danger in climate change is not that we are moving to a higher level of CO2 overall, but how quickly we are doing it.
&gt;Over the past 150 million years, carbon dioxide had been drawn down steadily (by plants) from about 3,000 parts per million to about 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution
This quote from the piece (assuming these statistics are true) would mean that the average rate of change in CO2 levels in the atmosphere over the last 150 million years was 0.00001813 ppm per year.
&gt;Human fossil fuel use and clearing land for crops have boosted carbon dioxide from its lowest level in the history of the Earth back to 400 parts per million today.
Now, if we take the beginning of the industrial revolution to be 1760 that means that over the last 255 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have changed from 280 ppm to 400 ppm. That is an average change of 0.470588 ppm per year.
That is almost 26000 times faster than the natural rate of change (over the last 150 million years) in atmospheric CO2 levels. If CO2 levels really do affect global temperatures, then we are causing a change that by Earth's standards may be fairly small, but we are causing it to happen very quickly. Most of the species on the planet that are not suited for warmer climates will have a hard time adapting at the rate that the atmosphere is warming.
Now, the argument that I just made against the author's stance may not be any more valid than his was. The carbon dioxide levels were only given at the start and end of the 150-million-year-period mentioned in the piece, and so I used those values. Chances are that carbon dioxide levels did not change in a linear fashion over that time period, and so life on Earth was probably keeping up with a higher rate of change in atmospheric CO2 levels at some times, and a lower one at others. But [as far as I know]( the rate of change now is much greater than it ever has been in the past, perhaps excluding some previous global catastrophes.

 It's not the level of CO2 that we need to worry about, its the fact that this level is changing so much faster than the world is used to.
~~Hey man, congratulations on the acceptance. Hope this giant clusterfuck of a thread serves a couple of important lessons:~~

~~1) Many things contributed to you getting that acceptance letter: GPA, MCAT, life story, interview, etc. The list also includes your race/ ethnicity. Unless you marked "Decline to answer" under AMCAS' race question, you cannot continue to claim that your URM status didn't give you an advantage. It absolutely does not mean that you got into a medical school just because you're black, but your race/ethnicity certainly gave you a luxury that many other applicants don't have. Seriously, you're in denial if you don't believe or understand that (which some of your posts seem to indicate).~~

~~2) This is only the beginning. You will see the same racism in medical school, residency, and when you're an attending. You will have idiot patients who doubt your skill because of the color of your skin. Don't let it get to your. Work harder to prove them wrong. You'll make a great doctor one day!~~

~~TL/DR: Be real. Be strong.~~
**Go away, troll.**
Wrong decision is very common cricket and Bangladesh is experienced with them. Umpire can give lbw decision which is very debatable. However, the situation of this match is very different. The match official ignored some regulation steps. For example,in run outs, Umpire usually goes to upstairs for even though it is evident that it was a out. Umpire showed blatant carelessness by not going upstairs,especially it was a wicket. Same goes for catch out of Mahmudullah. There was room for more verification,more angles,and zoom. This kind of indifference actually breaks the morale. India certainly a superior team and without this problem they would win. This attitude only shows ICC's indifference to other cricket nations
 Problem is not wrong decisions; it's the attitude. 
It is because pure egg is not as "smooth" as a mixture of egg,  water (milk),  and corn starch.  Forgive me,  I'm not a native speaker. To make the explanation short,  corn starch and water can disrupt the protein structure of pure egg yolk+egg white.
Also, when we are making any fried egg dish,  we add two table spoon of water,  half tea spoon of corn starch,  and a pinch of salt to the egg as we use chopsticks to mix the yolk with the white.  Then,  on a hot pan,  add oil first to prevent sticking. Once you pour the mixture into the pan,  TURN THE FIRE OFF after maybe 10-15 sec.  Then gently use a spatula to make sure each side of the mixture is coagulated a bit (so that the egg is not too hard).  Then remove the eggs,  prepare the tomato sauce with the fire back on and put the eggs back at last to heat it up again.  (of course, dun do that for too long). 
I hope you guys can understand my English. If you follow my instructions, you can have some smooth eggs to enjoy. 
Yea my method will make an easy dish become not easy.  But... who doesn't like soft,  smooth eggs? 
As an actuary, I can verify that it is a complicated process that involves many assumptions and relies on several dependencies.
Your mention of replacement costs, to me, indicates you are talking about property insurance of some kind, home for example.
With property insurance, you as the insured would pick your deductible level.  Pricing would then be calculated as the probabilities of different loss amounts, (total loss - deductible), times the loss amount.  Calculating the probabilities is the bulk of the work.  They are calculated by rating criteria.  These vary by insurance type and provider, but a general list would begin with age, gender, home age, geographic region, home value, claims history, etc...
The above process is standardized by creating curves of multiplicative factors based on rating criteria, so providers can calculate a quick rate for you when you ask for a quote.  Underwriters then verify that you match the rating criteria that was used to quote you a rate.
TL;DR
[Expected Losses per Insured]*[Rating Criteria Factors] + 
[Costs of Doing Business] = [Premium]
Underwriters verify your Rating Criteria's to be applied.

Sometimes your body doesn't do labor the way you read. I never dialated. My contractions were never consistent for 2 days before my water breaking. Water broke, still wasn't technically dialated. My body didn't even give me contractions after my water broke but for 20 min apart. I knew I was in pre labor for 2 days and the doctors/ family didn't believe me. My bloody show was shushed off by the idea it was just old blood because I never started to dialate! So TLDR you don't have to dialate to start labor. I trusted my instincts and got things ready fast! Thank god! 
On what planet do you think this is OK?  Who in the hell are you or the government or anyone else for that manner to tell the bandwidth providers how they should set their pricing?  
The internet is not a public good, it's a privately paid for technology these days.  The days of ARPANET are long behind us and if you want these companies to sink large amounts of capital into infrastructure to increase available bandwidth, you jolly well can't be telling them what to charge for the result. 
Moreover, all this NN rhetoric is at complete odds with reality.  I have been on the internet since it WAS ARAPANET and price per unit bandwidth has been steadily dropping while availability has been increasing *without big bad government involvement*.  
Worst of all, you people don't grasp that this especially appeals to the political droolers like Obama.  He and his bunch know that he got elected on a fluke.  (The dislike of Bush the 1st time, and the Conservatives that didn't show up to vote for Romney the 2nd time.)  These people  know they cannot consistently win a straightup, fair election.  Reality is biased to center right politics in the US.  So ... they want to do what all Chicago politicians do - cheat and game the system.  How does NN play into this?  Simple, these clowns have wanted the horribly misnamed "Fairness Doctrine" reinstated. If they can get this shoved down the throat of the internet, their biggest political enemies - like, say, Fox - will be forced to give what the FCC decides is "equal time".  They want this, because in the competitive marketplace of ideas, the right and center right is just crushing the other media outlets in viewership, readership, listeners, and so forth.   NN + FD gives them a way to force people that support them to be given air time at the expense of their political opposition.
"No big deal", you say?  "I hate the right anyway", you say?  Oh yeah?  American politics is cyclical.  Sooner or later, some version of a rightwinger will get into power.  If the left has established the precedent that NN can be construed to be lead to the Fairness Doctrine - and make no mistake the droolers in question EXACTLY want this - *then what stops the political right from doing the exact same thing?*  
Net Neutrality is unnecessary, unfair, and a danger to free speech.  It should be opposed by anyone who likes to be free.  Not the phony "I want what I want and I don't want to pay for it" kind of freedom, but the "Everyone should be free to speak their mind as they wish" kind of freedom.
I am not a parent but i know of a family friend who raised one of the most mature kids i have ever met. While raising his kid the rule he told me about was the "no bullshit" rule. He told me not to sugar coat everything and tell your kid how things really are straight up. I don't know how exactly he did it but there was never a santa or tooth fairy for the kid but he still got the gifts and rewards. The kid knows about how bad the world can be and there is so much about this little 9 year old that makes him so mature and seem a lot older than he is.
 no bullshit rule. Never lie to your kid just say how things are straight up.
Kid here. About to leave for college this fall. As someone most people will complement my parents on for having "raised me really well" etc, I can say that one of the best things my parents did was back up whatever they said, every time. "Do that, and you will get spanked" was never an empty threat. They didn't tell me "no" on anything they were not willing to punish me over, and they never did the "don't do that. Hey, I said don't. I'll spank you! Okay, 1...2...don't let me get to three! I'll get there. I'll do it! Okay, fine, three, now please stop or I really will have to spank you" thing. 
Time out was almost never used.
Punishments that minorly embarrass your kids are very memorable, such as the day I wouldn't quit yelling at the dinner table and had to wear underwear on my head for the rest of dinner as a 5 year old. Or having to sing the "pretty pony" song from my female cousin's favorite toy (as a boy, I hated this, and still remember it to this day).
Also, don't be afraid to tell your kids that money is the issue instead of making up some BS excuse (if they are old enough to understand). Your kids will figure it out eventually, and it's better to be straightforward with stuff instead of having them listen to your BS answer and feel bad because they think that you think that they can't be trusted or handle the truth. Be honest.
Finally, to anyone with kids, you are *not* raising kids. You are raising adults, who happen to be kids at the moment, so train and treat them like it. The difference this made with my parents and me was huge compared to my friends. You know those kids who seem really mature and know how to talk to adults without issue? They get treated like regular people instead of treated with the "talking to a child" mentality. Trust me.
you just missed some really good advice, and a summary won't do.
Similar yet somehow worse thing happened my freshman year of college. I walked into the community area of my floor and there were two girls that were talking in hushed tones. Me not picking up on this since I had just been hanging out with the rest of the floor doing w/e proceed to ask who died....
Her father had just been in an accident and the look her friend gave me was nothing short of hatred. I apologized and went on my way after letting her know I was just trying to break the tension of what I thought was an awkward moment.
Put foot in mouth about death while floormate's father's life hung in the balance.
I always seem to read the full text and then get really annoyed when I see at the bottom because I really should know better. 
For some reason I thought the rule included something to do with the player having to realize they have a broken stick. Which would make it less of a blown call and more of a grey area because I think there is a case for both Abdelkader completing a motion he committed too and for two distinct motions. But you can only see two motions when it's slowed down and as it happened live he may not have realized it was broken. 
I think it fairly could have gone either way. We got a break, but it wasn't a clear blown call
I feel that by entering in "baldwin" you tigger some event on the map. perhaps you can now interact with certain objects that you couldnt before. we shouldn't assume that this clue is solely related to the words we spell with the deposit boxes. I feel that just like with the first secret, there is some secret image that can be found by deciphering a audio trigger, and that we will have to stand in certain spots to open the secret vault / trigger an event. we know that there are radios all troughout the heists, so maybe one of them acts like the radio for PD:TH. It could also related to the fact that we never found the secret on the Diamond hesit. That secret could be the audio cue. Maybe you can change an audio tape thats in Hoxton Revenge.

maybe spelling baldwin is only the first step in unveiling this mystery, and a non-deposit box related event must occur. we may have to stand in certain positions like in the PD:TH secret, as there are many radios that could play and audio message telling us where to stand (like in PD:TH). maybe investigate Hoxton Revenge's audio tapes?
(either way this has got to be a big hint as to what we should do)
As a developer I'd like to clear something up; unless its an indie studio we basically have no say on what we make. If the 'business' people (wannabe wolfs of wallstreet w.w.w.) say do it we do it with the tools given to us by the device manufacturers and limitations put in place by everybody but us. I've long stopped making games but thats how it is basically.
Now on the other hand theres studios like Mojang(makers of minecraft) where the developer controlled how the game was done because its his company and hes the one making the product and was limited only by the power of the pc.
*** Developers and publishers are different aspects of the gaming business. E.g. Ubisoft and Mojang arent reigned over the same way.***
I don't really know. I try interdicting people coming from the Convoy Zone, but they get away before I scan them for Military intelligence.
What *is* fun is hanging around the convoy zone, side with CSG, and scan all of the CMDRs. The ones carrying Intel are hit with massive (multi-million credit) fines, but this isn't really productive, just frustrating for them.
The main reason we're losing according to Galnet is because our Marines have no supplies, and their guys have loads, meaning it's the trade goal we need to win, or at least stop them from trading. The problem is, they could just drop into Solo and trade away without fear of interdiction, and even those in Open that we interdict and kill will just be a blip in their supply chain, baring some kind of serious and organised blockade, which would be a logistical nightmare.
 Kill Lugh Traders giving weapons to Balandin, or buy a T6 or better and get hauling yourself.
Hm, that's interesting what you're saying about the battery life. I've had the exact opposite experience. Every one I know who has an iPhone is constantly running out of battery in the middle of the day, and having to take their phone chargers with them whenever they go out. That, or buying one of those battery cases. On my Oneplus One I get insane battery life, I'll unplug it in the morning around 6 and by the time I go to sleep at the end of the day it's no lower than 20%, even with heavy usage. 
Also, I don't want to get into any sort of argument, but I'd just like to say that I think with Android, a lot of people aren't prepared to do any sort of research at all on what phone they're buying, and assume a generic no-name phone running android Gingerbread is no better than a Samsung, HTC, or Motorola. I will admit, this is one area where Apple has done well, allowing their consumers to not have to worry about whether they've made the right choice buying their products.
However, when you do your research on the various phones running Android and become acquainted with the different OS versions and what kind of skins certain manufacturers over the OS, it's easy to understand why some people get such a bad first impression of Android. It's a lot to take in. Since Samsung is probably the most popular manufacturer of Android phones, people will typically look towards them for their first Android experience and become very disappointed with how ugly and laggy it can be. This isn't a problem with the OS, but rather with Samsung trying to do too much with their phones. They load tons and tons of bloatware on their phones that slow it down immensely, plus the carrier (Verizon, ATT) bloatware that also comes on the phone. Like I said though, if you do your research you'll find that buying something with a more pure android experience, like a Nexus or Motorola, will make Android much easier and faster to use. I never close apps on my phone. Android Lollipop + 3GBs of RAM make it so that I never have to. On pure Android you don't need to access a task manager to close apps, that's just something that Samsung does.
It's interesting what you say about the jailbreaking/rooting argument. I'd honestly say that most of the stuff you do on a jailbroken iPhone (changing fonts, icons, lockscreen style, downloading third party apps and customizations, widgets) can be done on a non-rooted Android. Rooting and jailbreaking are actually two very different things and can serve very different purposes.
And yeah, I guess you're right about the keyboards. I've found iPhone keyboards to be much more accurate than Android ones, although once you start using swipe typing it's a completely different story.
I like Android better but I promise I'm not a shill, just trying to have a friendly conversation
I've been there and I know what you mean. I went to cosmetology school and worked in salons for a little bit as an assistant (never become a full-blown hairstylist because my heart just wasn't in it). I remember in cosmetology school that shampooing obese clients was a fucking pain because their necks were too big to fit in the sink. Lean them back and there's at least a quarter inch gap because those sinks were made for human necks. This along with the factored in awkward/clumsiness of being a new cosmetology student lead to lots of angry obeasts whose entire backs are sopping after they get shampooed because they were too fucking fat to fit properly in the sink. Or the napes of their necks get left greasy as fuck because there's too much neck fat to even get your fingers back there to scrub.
There was also a big problem with the cutting capes we were provided not being big enough for the girth of their necks. Everyone'd end up just wrapping the cape around them and then sort of haphazardly fastening them shut with clips.
There was one obeast who would frequent the school I went to named Theresa and everyone called her Big T. She was AT LEAST 350 lbs and such a raging, psychotic bitch that it certainly had to be some kind of medical condishun how angry she was. She was the only client whose hair I ever fucked up on purpose because I didn't want her to request to come back to me. I wonder if Big T is still alive or if her ticker gave out yet.
Obeasts have ruined their bodies to the point where they can no longer have their basic needs attended to while getting a haircut.
This whole trading community I've fallen into with CS:GO is interesting. I'm not sure if I hate it or love it, but I do know that everyone is here for a profit. I'm sure there was a time when people just opened cases and traded/sold what they didn't want, and bought what they did. I'm sure it was a pretty cool time to be a part of CS. Now people try to make a living off of something never meant to provide in such a way. It creates some real shitheads in the trading world.
I'll stick with how I use the skin system, not worried about making a buck as much as I open/buy what I like. Hell I traded down from a Kara Scorched MW I un-crated to a M9 Night FT because i like the way the Night looks. Took a ~20$ (per steam analyst) hit but it didn't bother me. The guy i traded it to has traded like 5 times and every time it's been a 1-2$ profit... Seems like a huge waste of time for such small profit. I got scammed for 36$ worth of keys the other day but just chalked it up to being a trading noob... until I realized every time i ask to trade i get 50 scammer requests and have to weed through them like i'm giving interviews.
TL:DR- Play the damn game, stop ruining it for everyone by trying to make a living buying or selling keys/skins. Enjoy it for what it is.
What would you gain from a rebellion? 
A) Succeed, and you killed the creator of the world, and presumably the master of the afterlife. What then? If it was undeniable that God exists, then wouldn't that mean Heaven and Hell exists? With no God, would you go to heaven or hell? Would heaven be in utter chaos after the slaying of its creator? Would Lucifer, the one who wanted to destroy humanity, reign over both heaven and hell, and what would happen to us then? It would be pointless rebelling violently, and God isn't known for taking opinions or people questioning/disobeying him.
B) Fail, face the wrath of God, or beg for forgiveness and hope. You're nothing but a slave now with a pissed off master (who's extremely volatile). 
Honestly, if there is a God and if he's like in the old testament, then I'd say it's better to be without one. You can't slay a God and even if you did the consequences will never be the same.

 You done goofed :(
Look into Soraka if you want a true healer. As someone who mains Sona, I can honestly say her heal is somewhat close to a joke. It costs a large amount of mana early, and doesn't heal that well. Sona is VERY strong at long, sustained trades however. If your adc and you keep having skirmishes with the enemy, you'll outlast them no problem. Sona is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY weak to being engaged on, as her only CC is her E powerchord (Which you typically don't get a point in E until level 4 or 8), or her ultimate. You're either gambling your life with a powerchord, or burning your ultimate just to save your life. Soraka has an AoE silence, which turns into a root if they stay in it at the end. You throw that puddle down and walk away like nothing happened. Nami's E is basically 3 Sona's E powerchords, except applicable on ANY ally, and Nami has her bubbles as well for disengage, counter-engage, or just straight engage if you're good enough. The other main difference is that Sona's heal is not targetted, and I've had cases where it would top of my 90% hp ally instead of healing the 20% one, whereas Nami and Soraka are able to target their heals.  
 Sona isn't the best person to be a healbot.  
EDIT: Soraka's heal goes from 4 to 2 seconds based on points in it, whereas Sona keeps a static 12 second cooldown.
You can if you want, but considering you could straight up drip 11mg/mL, I wouldn't worry too much.
It really becomes a concern when your base has more nicotine than any premade juice does, with the risks increasing with concentration. 
In my case, I'm working with either 60mg/mL VG base, or 100mg/mL PG base, both of which are concentrated enough to be a fume risk as well. So if you're dealing with nasty doses of nicotine per milliliter (i.e. a drop probably contains 20mg) you really have to step up your safety and treat it like you would in a chem lab.
 you're not at much risk with 11mg/mL, but you should be as safe as possible if you start using concentrates. Safety first!
Because this person is putting equality, morality, peace and love before materialism, convienience, selfishness and vanity. A life lived for others, is worth living. Even then, its a massive disservice to suggest they are 'sacrificing" anything. They are choosing, positively to spend each day making THE world a better place. Not just HIS world. We should aspire to a life with such richness, passion, dedication and purity of spirit. Not pity them, or be put off by their earthly circumstances. Nice things, popularity and even personal freedom, history proves, are not important to people who are at the forefront of human progress.
 He IS building a better life. Right here. Right now. For everyone.

I feel I need to preface this by saying I have a limited knowledge of Celtic prehistory, and that someone more qualified than me would be a better speaker, but what I do know about the Celts is quite interesting within the context of these pictures.
First, this find is quite remarkable, but within the scope of Celtic studies its completely understandable. Some of these artifacts almost appear as though they were made in southern Europe, notably in Italy and Greece, which is probably because they were. For many centuries, the Celts maintained trade networks with the Greeks based out of their colonial holdings in Spain, and Gades (Cadiz) in particular, largely due to the fact that the Greeks had easy access to copper and other minerals coming from mines in southern Ireland. This connected the Mediterranean cultures with the Atlantic littoral (think the coast of western Europe), a region currently under study by anthropologists as a new theory to explain the origins of the Celtic world. Trade would have been prevalent in Hellenic times along the coastline between Gades and the British Isles, from southern England to northern Germany, and from Occitania to modern-day Bordeaux; in Roman times, trade would have been rerouted overland as the Romanization of Gaul and then Britain made safe overland routes possible.
Obviously, there are some elements to the artifacts which seem uniquely Celtic. The bends worked into the golden rims of the vase (which is ostensibly Greek, as I think the article confirms) are typical of Celtic artwork and I would say they have been added post-import (but they could very well have been directly commissioned). Something to remember is that it is believed Celts of high status would use these exotic goods as a sign of opulence and wealth and probably did not use them in quite the same way the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans did. Lastly, the humanoid-looking figures on the amphora are not humans but rather animals, which is how anthropologists believe the Celts depicted their gods (similar to how Greek and Roman gods had animal analogues).
Again, not sure this is all entirely accurate - as there are a few theories about Celtic relations with the Mediterranean - but **artifacts come from the Mediterranean to the Celts through Atlantic trade, although the artifacts do feature some uniquely Celtic elements.**

Don't forget that one male top who thinks he can dom everyone irrespective of who they are and always takes it too far then gets kicked out of the community.
Story time:
My ex and I used to switch and at a munch this asshat decided to impose himself upon our relationship because he could't find a bottom (he used to take things too far and ignore safewords etc) he thought himself a hardman because nobody would say anything. well that day he pushed his luck too far while I was at the bar he started trying it on with my girlfriend I saw red walked over pinned him against the wall by the throat and choked him out. 
Unfortunately that got the whole group barred from the pub but it did allow some of the girls who had been with him to speak out and tell people what he had done to them without their consent and got him kicked from all of the surrounding groups.
TL:DR? 
Ass hat tried to dominate my girl, choked him out he wasn't aloud to be part of the community for what was in effect rape 
Currently, football and basketball teams are the revenue producers for the biggest collegiate athletic departments.  A vast majority of the money comes from TV networks (principally, ESPN, Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS) which pay member schools to televise football and basketball games live.  
A majority of the profits are used to finance non-revenue sports (track, soccer, tennis, volleyball, swimming, lacrosse, etc).  Some of this usage is related to Title IX (a very complicated topic but as it relates to sports, it requires equal opportunities for women to participate in collegiate athletics).   
  Paying the athletes market value would be the end of many  non-revenue sports and the accompanying educational opportunities.  
I would pay someone to hire actors, makeup artists, special effects people and writers. I want an elaborate zombie prank. I mean every detail planned out. It cant just be a bunch of zombies suddenly showing up and attacking people. I want this to be like the very beginning of the zombie apocalypse. It has to begin with one person "getting murdered." A crowd will gather, the police will take witness statements, get evidence from the scene etc. (Of course, the police will be informed about the "filming of the movie" the crowd will not though.) There will be a few actors amongst the crowd. The murder victim will slowly rise from beneath the blanket that covers its cold, lifeless body. It will attack one of the actors, start eating him/her in front of the horrified, confused crowd. As they try to make sense of whats going on the zombie will move on to other actors taking a few bites out of their warm, tender bodies then move on to the next. The first actor bitten will now begin to change and bite other actors. Now, by this time the people who watch a lot of horror will have left to prepare for the impending demise of human kind. Those still in disbelieve will have made sense of the situation by the time a few more zombies arise. That's when they begin to panic. I would want this to go on until a herd, maybe 100, zombies arise. 
I know this would need a lot of meticulous planning and really good special effects. I'm willing to work on it though. I think it would be interesting to see how people would react. 
Start a zombie apocalypse panic. 
We had this talk in 2012. It's now almost halfway into 2015.
Imo, Rose got his MVP in 2011 deservedly, but Lebron and Dwight arguably should have been crowned over him. I do acknowledge that he led a great Bulls team into a deep playoffs run(I think their roster was severely underrated, they had many great players besides Rose) 
Durant's ceiling is much higher, and his injury was more recent and less severe. It's been 3+ years and you still haven't given up on Rose. Why should we say the same about Durant when it's only been half a season? Plus, when Durant *did* play there was no question he was still MVP-calibre Durant.
Paul George is on a talentless team. They have some decent role players like Hibbert and George Hill, but no-one near the calibre of Gasol or Butler or Noah.
 your comparisons aren't making sense to me.
So the game is a New Mutants, X-Men style game. We're a bunch of teens with super powers who have to keep it a secret. We eventually had to leave our highschool when we were recruited by a 'mutant highschool/mutant freedom fighter institution' (See Emma Frost &amp; Sebastian Shaw's school).
We're on a mission to break into a government building to steal/destroy the files they have which detail all the mutants in the area and what they are capable of. We decide to stealth in at night, no casualties, no one even knows we were there. We all agree it's best if no one gets hurt so we can expose the files and promote nonviolent protests. Our ingress is through the roof and I fly the computer genius on the roof while our lookout waits by the car on the parking garage top floor across the street. The other flyer is a human torch and scoots himself across while our fighter claws her way up the side of the building. 
We get inside and on to the top floor but just as we get inside, a van crashes through the window on the main floor and Avalanche, Pyro, Toad and The Blob pile out. Pyro and Avalanche start wrecking the place, destroying the street so no backup can approach and blowing up cars. Alarms go off all over the street and throughout the building. The human torch's fire sets off the buildings sprinkler systems (he could only turn it on twice in a day and had a one hour recharge so he took to turning it on and leaving it on for the duration of a mission) and he flies outside, having a super weakness to water. Guards start piling up the stairs to us. Torch asks "Wait, are there security cameras anywhere?"
GM: "In a govt building? Across from a multi-story parking garage? You bet!"
Torch says "Well, I guess we're bad guys now." &lt;Direct quote&gt; and starts fireballing police cars and firetrucks with Pyro. 
This is the end of what you need to know but here's the rest of the session
I take out the guards on the stairs with my sonic blast, lamenting the permanent damage I probably did to their bones and eardrums. Our computer guy crit-fails and formats the hard drive without finding out if there were hard-copies of the files. We smash the window and shove the filing cabinets in the room out the window, so Torch can burn them. Our fighter claws down the building and I fly the computer genius to the ground, which looks like a bomb hit it. Cars twisted and burning on ripped apart roads, hydrants spraying water and power lines sparking everywhere. Our computer guy runs back to the van and I try to assemble the party. Torch is still blowing up firetrucks and police cars and hurling fireballs at anyone approaching the scene. I wildly guesture (he can't hear anything over the fire and explosions) that the mission is done and we need to escape before sentinels arrive. He just laughs and keeps blowing shit up. Our fighter is fighting The Blob and Toad. I blast Toad and Sonic Wall her away from Blob and drag her out of there, crit successing on leadership and diplomacy with charisma bonuses. I get her to the car and eventually Torch flies over to us. We eventually get back to the school after a police chase, crit driving fails, stealth and heaps of problems. We get scolded by the Headmaster for making such a mess and find out they hired the Brotherhood (Blob, Pyro et al.) to cause the diversion. I vow to escape the school, not agreeing with their principles of working with dangerous terrorists and spend my XP points to get a non-lethal sonic blast that does Fatigue damage only (no more serious damage to people who don't deserve it!). 
Torch gets a call from his father who screams at him about a mutant terrorist attack which landed a lot of his friends in critical condition in hospital since, as the GM points out, Torch made his father a volunteer fire-fighter who taught him about fire safety (kinda like a Dexter situation). His father wants to know if he had anything to do with that and they have a frank exchange. 
We had so many amazing adventures like that. I miss rolling with that GM daily. Torch ended up vowing to kill my character for being such a pussy and holding the team back. The GM told me his words were "Hey guys, why don't we kill Logan? It's not like he helps the team and he doesn't get along with us at all." This is after we'd been on numerous adventures, saved each other's lives, escaped Genosha and had some amazing and hilarious times... But that whole escapade is a story for another time.
one of our party decided it'd be easier to be evil

I'm late to the party, but honestly, pretty much every campaign I run ends up with the players doing stuff like that because I tend to be the diplomatic character in my group.
The one that comes to mind is when the PCs were passing through a city that didn't matter. I hadn't written anything out for it, it was just a place that they had to get through to hire a ship. I made the mistake of mentioning that the city was "relatively rich." That off-handed comment set off a heist that would put Oceans 11 to shame.
After intense planning, this is what happened:
The rogue tries to set a small forest fire nearby to pull the militia out of the town. He ends up igniting himself with the pitch, starting a massive conflagration that consumes the whole forest and sees him severely burned, floating unconscious down the river towards the city.
Our rogue was playing the part of the helpless merchant, and had arranged for a wagon wheel to fall off in the middle of the span of one of the bridges, forcing traffic on the bridge to halt. The plan was to use this to prevent reinforcements from arriving at the main objective: a wealthy merchant guild headquarters. Instead, the panic caused by the fire and traffic jam started a riot, and the rogue was lucky to escape with his life as he ran to join the fighters at the merchant's guild.
The guards there were busy trying to load up carts with the gold and goods from the merchant house, which I thought would make the escape part easy. Instead, the party was convinced the best stuff was still hidden inside, and killed their way through three floors of unarmed merchants before realizing the carts outside were, in fact, the big-ticket items of the heist. The thief realized that before the others, and stole a significant percentage before they even realized what had happened. Eventually they got the cargo to the harbor, where they violently seized control and set off to sea.
I was trying so hard to kill them the entire time, but the dice were on their side every step of the way. They bungled their way through the heist, picked up the comatose ranger when he reached the ocean, and made off with a king's ransom in stolen goods. I had planned for them to be hunted down as a result of that, but the campaign ended due to other reasons before that could happen.
I've got a ton of stories like this though, if anyone's interested.
TL:DR-- I described a town as rich without thinking about it, set off the crime of the century.

This reminds me of one of the pivotal moments in our last campaign.

My friend who lives in old Louisville was robbed at gunpoint while walking to class at UofL close to his home. He returned home later that day to find that his house (more specifically his room) was broken into and robbed in a, what was believe to be, separate incidence. 
- Join a gang or fight the toughest guy who lives in old Louisville your first day so you seem like you would put up a fight.
I know sometimes people do this type of thing, but you misinterpret my particular motives.  The overshadowed comment refers to the mainstream (LAMEstream, get it?) media, which likely won't give these rallies much play.  You may have heard that tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating in Ohio, but this received press hardly comparable to the Wisconsin coverage.  I posted because, like one comment already pointed out, many Floridians may not have any idea this is happening, yet would love to participate.
Sometimes people post things for like... real life, rather than made up karma.
*Edit* Spelling.
It depends.  Roma has added very minimal depth over the last year primarily due to the Sensi family being in litigation to sell the club.  If you look at the number of games they play versus the number of players in the squad compared to Milan or Inter they look like minows.  Roma just doesnt have the depth or enough quality to play 2 games a week during the bulk of the season and be competitive throughout.  I'm not looking for a blockbuster deal over the summer window, but I would like to see some depth on the wings (provided they play a 4-2-3-1) an extra central defender (regardless of whether Mexes leaves, since the three CBs take too many cards) and a RB.  To get to the Champs Lge is a huge amount of money compared to the Europa Lge and the same number of games, so I would prefer a fourth place finish, more money for the same number of games.  Yes, the cup is important and I would love to squash those arrogant, money spending, non-Italian pricks of Inter in the next round and take down the shady politician in the final.  
- Rambling, finish 4th, win the cup, add depth in the summer
Why does this debate always centre around promoting women to boards as opposed to top leadership positions in their respective industry (eg partner in law/accounting/engineering firm)? I assume they mean promoting women to being executive directors on boards. Those are the ones who earn the big bucks usually and are selected internally by the corporation on the basis of merit if its a private company or fucking VOTED in if its a public company (so shareholders get out there and vote for more women if you want them in!).
Many directors on boards are non executive directors and are paid a token fee (usually in the range of $10k but as little as $1) for their service but actually have permanent employment elsewhere. Non executive directors are usually specialists in certain critical areas of business, eg law, accounting and banking and finance. They are there to give token board level advice in relation to their area of expertise. They do not make commercial business decisions - only the executive directors do that. Because AT PRESENT more men than women are leaders in these areas, more men than women are represented as non executive directors on boards. If the ASX figures people keep citing includes the number of non executive directors on boards then the figures are fucking misleading. 
The number of women moving into key leadership positions within many areas relevant to business (particularly law, with something like 65% of law grads being female and far more women than men now studying at tertiary level) is increasing every year. These women will likely go on to be the non executive directors of tomorrow. 
The change is happening organically if we just fucking leave it alone. You want to get more women onto boards, keep going with the work/life balance incentives like paid parental leave or subsidised child care. 
I think it's fucking atrocious that people assume that women can't make this change happen themselves. Most of the women I work with and know are extremely good at their jobs, dedicated and ambitious. If they want something they'll get it. They certainly don't want a fucking pity promotion because their darling pretty little selves couldn't get it otherwise.
**the fucking ASX figures are inflated because they count non executive directors who are typically male because men AT PRESENT dominate key leadership positions in areas like law, finance and accounting. Women are steadily increasing their presence in these areas and will be the future non executive directors of tomorrow thus reducing the gender imbalance organically.**
A loose rule I use is:
Wet Season - Wipe down and lube every 2/3 rides.
Dry Season - Wipe down and lube every 1-2 weeks or when dirty
- If your bike is dirty clean it.
As for replacement of gear, syncsynchalt seems to have some good advice.
What I was trying to say in regard to the first point you disagree with is that many "liberal types" (I really don't like to use these collective terms because everybody is different but I hope you know what I mean) are already on board that *some* government programs can be bad and destructive. My experience is that if people arrive at libertarianism it is the social programs like welfare and public education that are the most difficult ones for people to let go of intellectually so to speak. This is my explanation for why most people who don't agree with things like welfare tend to be libertarian (though not always): if they no longer believe in welfare they've probably previously already given up their support of most other programs which inevitably puts them either at the libertarian position or leaning that way.
I agree with you that poverty is inherently arbitrary and ideas of poverty change over time (a person considered living in poverty in the USA today would be considered wealthy compared to a person living in poverty in the Sudan) but this doesn't really make a case against the argument. All the poverty statistics come from the government and government's are the people who decide what threshhold constitutes "poverty"... using their own metrics their own social programs have failed but personally I don't even believe somebody who has a roof over their head and food should be considered in poverty at all. But that's a personal thing, I realise setting an arbitrary line can be useful for some purposes.
I don't think I said that libertarianism is increasing, can you point to where I did say that? Either way I *do* believe it is increasing but I also agree with you that socialist (or perhaps "anti-capitailst") views seem to be on the rise. I don't think these things are mutually exclusive. As various countries like the USA and the UK begin to get into worse situations the people recognise that something is wrong. As discomfort increases people look for answers. In that climate people could move towards libertarianism *or* socialism from their previous position of not really paying attention which would mean both movements would gather steam.
In my opinion history shows socialism doesn't work and freedom does, just from a practical stand point. I also happen to think there is a moral argument that convinces me libertarianism is the consistent and right position, but I know a lot of people are more persuaded by utilitarian arguments and to those people I think honest examination of economics, history and philosophy leads to the conclusion that libertarianism is far better than redistribution/regulation/controls etc.
Just to reply to something you said to shaurz
&gt;A well educated, well informed populace is the best protection against tyranny. There are people who will be brainwashed by whoever attempts to brainwash them (the state, the media, their teachers, whoever) and those who will not. Those who will not are still better off with the education.
Many libertarians (and certainly myself) would argue that the state does the opposite of educating people. Rather it kills creativity, teaches a lot of meaningless facts and biased pro-state history, completely fails to promote critical thinking or economics which are critical in order to form coherent political opinions... the list goes on. And this isn't an opinion either, the facts speak for themselves: the state has been spending more and more over the past 30 years whilst at the same time graduating less and less educated kids. Many children are coming out of *12 years* of state education without the ability to even read or write properly. At the same time private institutions, which are competing with something that is *being given away for free* (always a difficult task) are educating kids to a far higher standard for *less than half the cost*.
People often talk a lot about how Sweden shows how socialism is a good thing, but the truth is Sweden actually has more of a free market in education than the United States: in Sweden the government does give money to parents for their kids education but the parents can decide which private school to send those kids to. The UK on the other hand shares the USA model. As a UK resident I recently spent some time in Sweden and the difference between intelligence in the young people was scary. Simply allowing free markets and *choice* for parents quickly and radically improves education.
 If you want an "educated populace" the last thing you want is government controlling the education.
My dad was in occasional correspondence with some guy in Manchester several years ago. I think their interaction was limited to a few casual comments to each other, they were both on a mailing list (I've mentioned before that my dad is, lamentably, a Man Utd fan). Anyway, he was in England for work and had a couple days off, so he stopped by Manchester. He'd mentioned this on that mailing list, and so the guy he'd been talking to invited him to meet him at the stadium. OT was closed, but the guy had called some people and managed to convince them to give my dad a mini-tour around the stadium and trophy room. Was a pretty nice gesture from a guy he'd never met.
My Manchester United-supporting father got access to a closed Old Trafford with the help of another United fan he barely knew. 
Actually, if we recycled it like Japan and France do, instead of taking it out of use after a government-mandated time limit because "TERRORISTS!", we'd have far, far less waste to worry about - specifically, 96% less (  Most nuclear waste is still usable, but since the Carter administration the government has been afraid to recycle it because they fear it getting "into the wrong hands" - as if terrorists would get it from the US and not Korea or Iran. As for storage, we already have Yucca mountain, but people are still afraid of it because "OMG RADIASHUN FROM NUKE-U-LUR THINGS!"  
 We have the ability to re-use and store waste, the population is just too ill-educated to not be afraid of it, and the politicians follow what the people want, or think they want.
I come from the Ohio Valley, and nuclear is way less radioactive than coal.  I watched plants, fowl, and wildlife die under coal-fired powerplants in the 80's.  That Lil' nuke Generator?   No worries, bummer, but no worries.   
 We got worse here.......
You should check the editor's note they have added to the story: "As a general clarification, ounce for ounce, coal ash released from a power plant delivers more radiation than nuclear waste shielded via water or dry cask storage."
What that means is that nuclear waste is far, far more radioactive over a much, much longer time. However, after being put into radioactively shielded containers, the shielded waste emits 100x less radioactivity then fly ash at the moment of release. Over its radioactive lifetime even shielded waste that is never disturbed, and whose containment never degrades, will still emit several orders of magnitude more radiation than fly ash, however.
 Coal might suck, but nuclear waste is far, far more radioactive than coal waste.
This is silly. This is on par for why do coal power plants not have insurance from domestic terrorists. It's just not financially equitable to insure for catastrophic failure of a large system. The company would be bankrupt either way, so paying X millions per year would only make the power more expensive and not realize any gains in case of failure. On the other hand with the proper security systems essentially their engineering department IS their insurance company. Nuclear power plants have huge amounts of paperwork and quadruple checks for their system testing (even testing concrete strength several times a year). 
** They do have an insurance company, it's their engineering (QA/RCI) departments**
In my apartment complex, the washer only takes about 30min while the dryers take around an hour. This can be a problem if the dryers are going when you want to put yours in the wash and the people don't get their stuff out of the dryers in time. For some reason I feel weird just leaving my laundry sitting around wet in a basket, so generally I just leave it in the washer and check back every 10min or so until the stuff is out of the dryer.
Recently, this happened. I came back about 10min and someone was taking my stuff out of the washer. I'd like to say I handled it well, but in reality I immediately turned around and left. I rationalized this as having to go back to my apt to get quarters instead of loonie + quarter because one of the washing machines takes the loonie + quarter while the other takes only 5 quarters. Thinking I was going to put my next load in the wash as I moved the other into the dryer, I was planning on using the loonie + quarter. Anyways, I waited like 5min and went back, put my stuff in the dryer, my other stuff in the washer... but yeah. Awkward. Yet ultimately it was all because the first people didn't get their stuff out of the dryer, though in retrospect I probably should have just left my stuff in the basket. Of course, the person who moved my laundry could have used the open washer (the fact that one was free was one of the reasons I didn't take mine out), but I guess they didn't have the 5 quarters either.
 I'm a reluctant laundry asshole.
Sorry, there is no such thing as first come first serve when it comes to LEAVING your finished clothes in a machine in a shared laundry facility, period. YOU are the original asshole for leaving your shit in there, I am gonna put it on the table or basket (nicely, not on the floor or anything) the second I need the machine if you aren't there. If that makes me the asshole, then too bad you feel that way. YOU can worry about buying a house, using a laundromat OR set a timer/alarm and be there to get your clothes on time if you don't like it.
 Sorry, but I will move your clothes nicely if you aren't there and won't feel a damn bit guilty for doing it.
A few years ago my sister bought a dog. Whenever I was at her house I'd suggest that instead of letting it poop and piss on the floor, maybe, just maybe, they could think about trying to house train it. They never did.
Anyway, when the inevitable happened and she moved back in with our parents and me\*\*\*\*, it pissed everywhere. I loathed it. I was quite vigilant in keeping my bedroom door shut, but of course once in a while I'd forget or not quite shut it properly, and that little demon would get inside.
One day this occurred, and when I returned I found that he had specifically picked out the one item touching the floor that it was most important he *did not* piss on: My Xbox. It's like the little bastard had intelligently picked out the one thing that would piss me off the most and showered it was his vile stench. Cue trolldog image.
I quite firmly ordered my sister to *clean it the hell up*. Before I go on, let me assure you that this was not some freak, one off occurrence. This was not some crazy, unlikely coincidence that she could not have foreseen. For literally months I had been reminding her weekly that she needed to teach that thing some rules or it would continue to enstench\* her every possession. And every week she ignored me. And every day he did so, and she or her boyfriend\*\* would pick him up, and tell him in the warmest, most cutesy, babyish voice, that he was *such a naughty boy, yes he wass, yes he WASSSS!!!*.
Now the problem with dogs is that understanding English is not one of their strong points. Especially when sarcasm or inappropriate tone it used. Even if he was human, he wouldn't have been old enough to understand such nuanced language. And so he took their words as praise and continued to systematically\*\*\* recolour their carpet from a dull off white to lively yellow. Point is, she **fucking knew** he did this and made *no attempt to stop him*.
Anyway. So she's in my room doing the most half-assed job in the world of cleaning this stuff up. Barely cleaning it one bit, making excuses, obviously trying to get out of this in any way possible. I tell her that she's clearly *not* done and I'd like my floor disinfected. She sees an out, and grabs hold tightly - telling me that somehow *I'm the one being an asshole* and that she *doesn't give a shit that it's her fault*, and she's *not cleaning jack shit*, and storms out.
I'm not the calmest person in the world when people piss me off, but this time I kept surprisingly cool. I simply went to where her nearly dry laundry was hanging up, took her pyjamas, and used them as my rag to soak up the remaining dog piss before neatly hanging them back up where they were and disinfecting the hell out of my hands.
\*Yeah I make up words.
\*\*Who was a douche.
\*\*\*His system was to randomly spray an endless torrent of urine over it until reaching the desired result.
\*\*\*\*Yes I live with my parents; despite the free room I still believe I have the right to a reasonable level of hygiene. 
Every time I tell this story it blows out to way longer than it should. I get like that when I'm angry. Anyway, - sister's dog pissed in my room, she refused to clean it, so I did - with her clothes.
My first wedding was court house, shorts and t-shirts, just a couple witnesses and the officiant.   It was okay, and I always said I would never change a thing.. Years passed and it seemed less special..  Maybe because we fell out of love, who knows. We divorced after 18 years..  
My second marriage, my wife and I wanted to do something special.. We had a medium sized wedding, about 90 people, all close friends and relatives..   She did the white dress, I wore a tux had a best man and a grooms man.. etc..etc..  We took this chance to celebrate our love for each other, and to share that love with our friends and family.. It was a great time, and way more memorable than the first.
Getting dressed up was fun, I am a t-shirt and shorts kind of guy, it gave me an opportunity to see what it's like to dress all fancy.  My wife looked beautiful in her dress..  
Forcing others to dress up, well that didn't happen, except for the groomsmen and the brides maids.. But they all enjoyed it too, they enjoyed picking out the dresses and helping to pick out the suits.
Being the center of attention was weird, but enjoyable, because I knew it was for a good thing, having my friends and family speak about us at the dinner was neat, I never knew someone of them though of us that way. It actually strengthened the bond with some of us, and my father, whom I have hated since I could speak actually said some wonderful things about me, that I don't think he would have ever been able to say otherwise.  Because of that our relationship is healing, and I like that..   
Just remember you are the center of attention because your friends and family are there because they love you and your fiance.  They want to be a part of this union between the two of you, and if they didn't want to be, they wouldn't RSVP that they are coming :)
 -- Experienced both types of weddings, and prefer the big wedding/ceremony over a court house elopement. 
I agree that the wedding isn't for you, it's for your family. We had a wedding for our parents, my grandmother, aunts, uncles, etc. However, we didn't want it big and expensive. We had the ceremony done in our back garden by my dad, and the "reception" was a potluck that I put my mother and mother-in-law in charge of. 

You pay more for things titled "wedding" - our wedding cake was just a nice cake from a baker I like, my wedding dress was just a nice dress, and we spent less than $500 on the whole thing, including invitations and announcements. 

We hated the attention but parents/grandparents needed the event. It was informal, at home, and cheap yet still gave them the memories and satisfaction. Winning!
Edited for formatting but still one big blob o text. WTF.
Totally!!! me and my wife did this and have NO regrets.  We both aren't in any financial situation for an elaborate waste of a few grand.  
We also didn't have to deal with appeasing famility members who could not care any less about you, but an elaborate party thrown to their specifications.  
There was no dressing up, but we wore decent clothes (what we wore on our first date), got a justice of the peace and our private vows.  
Marriage is about two people and committing to each other, not a ceremony.
its all about what you and your future spouce want for each other

When we got married, we sent letters to our respective families that we’re going to get married, and we’d like to keep it intimate. We arranged a trip to Vienna (just an hour flight from where we lived then), invited two friends (the witnesses to the marriage) and had a nice, sunny day, getting married in the morning and eating ice cream and touring the city in the afternoon.
When we arrived back home, we had three more small informal celebrations: One with my wife’s family (~10 people, ~1 hr away), one with my family (~6 ppl, ~6 hrs away) and about a month later we threw a small party for some local friends.
Very, very relaxed, no one needed to get dressed up more than he/she wanted to, and it wasn’t over on a day but was drawn out over several weeks (wedding was in autumn, and the last party in December), which was very nice.
* A++++ would do it again
I am a humanist celebrant. I have married a few couples at this point, experiencing both small ceremonies, medium-sized receptions and a gigantic affair with like 14 in the wedding party and people flying in from all over the country. The following is my perspective having experienced weddings from that angle:
1) People love weddings. It's a perfect excuse to leave the kids with grandma or a neighbor, skip out of work and have a long weekend (for the married folks). A lot of people will drop a lot of things and come to a wedding when they wouldn't come for just any old party. Not everyone loves weddings, obviously, but it's almost certainly going to be a fun occasion.
2) One of the lines I say in my ceremony, directly to the bride and groom, can be paraphrased as, "Look at all of the people here, all the of the important people from each of your lives. This group of people will, in all likelihood, never be gathered in the same place, ever again. And they're all here for you." It really is true. Weddings are basically the gathering of all the people most important in the lives of the two people getting married. Maybe it's selfish to want to gather all those people together, but I think it's an honor to them, too.
With those insights, combined with the fact that I'm an atheist who has no desire for big ceremonies, here's what I would want to do (with the caveat that the woman I end up marrying will obviously have a big say in how this goes):
- No tuxes. If anything, I'll buy a new suit. Bride can do whatever she wants.  
- No wedding party. I don't want to be choosing between my friends and my brothers for who is the best man or who is a groomsman or who is an usher (the adopted stepchild of wedding parties).  
- Short wedding ceremony, performed by a friend. I have several friends who are humanist celebrants, and I would be overjoyed if one of them would perform the ceremony. I had the privilege of marrying one of my best friends to her now-husband, and it was fantastic.  
- Ceremony to be immediately followed by huge party. This is where I'd spend all the money - all on great food and good booze and probably a keg of some really rare beer I have to order months and months ahead of time. I want a shuttle service so nobody has to drive anywhere, babysitting for any kids that are brought along and generally everything to be taken care of so that everybody can really let loose and have the time of their lives.  
- No retreating back to the hotel room with the bride at midnight or whatever. The reality is that, if I'm going to be married, I'll have had sex with the lady in question previously. No reason to make the wedding night about going back and having exhausted sex after a very long day. I want the plan to be going around the hotel everyone is staying at as a couple, visiting parties of friends and families alike until we're the last two people awake, at which point we can go back and pass out, too exhausted to do anything but crawl into bed. I think the wedding night is more about the people who are there for you than about being with each other. The couple has a long, long time to be together, provided everything goes well. Those people will never be around all together again. Why not stay up all night with them?  
 Weddings are special mostly because of the people who come to them, not the couple getting married. Make it a huge party and celebrate that the most important people in your lives are there.
My husband and I are getting "married" in a week, but we actually wandered off and got hitched at the courthouse about 8 months ago. Our close friends and family know, but not everyone does; we didn't want to "cheapen" the whole wedding event for people.
Our ceremony is more or less a mutual friend talking about how awesome we are, and then an exchange of self-written vows and rings (if they come in time - and that is a whole NOTHER story). It will last, including processional and recessional, all of 12 minutes. 
THEN WE PARTY.
We just want a chance to celebrate our love in front of friends and family and this is the best way to do it.
(abridged to leave out boring details) After nearly 5 years of being engaged my fiancée just up and asked, why don't we do it next week?  So we did. City Hall, two witnesses, one suit, one off the rack wedding dress (just as beautiful as custom but way less $) and the whole thing was done. On one hand parents had some disappointment, but also I detected some relief that they wouldn't have to go through prep and all the usual stuff. Also know they're happy (as are we) at being able to keep saved $ which we will be putting towards a house. 
A++++++ Highly Recommended, would elope again!!!
My sister did something similar, except she took it one step further.
Both she and her bf had birthdays in January, so they often did a combined birthday party. Most of the time I'd get an invitation maybe 2 weeks in advance. Last year I got it about a month in advance. I didn't think anything of it at the time, I was just impressed at how organized she was being. They'd decided to rent out the upstairs of a local place, get them to do a custom menu, invite about 10-20 close family &amp; friends for dinner, then have a larger party afterwards for extended family/friends. No one really thought much of it.
Then, during dinner, her bf proposed to her. Everyone was really blown away, especially my parents. I actually didn't see it because I was talking to someone else and not paying attention, which I was kind of bummed about. Dinner ended, more people started arriving. Since it was now an engagement party, many a friend was phoned. Once most of the people were there, my sister made an announcement: not only was it their birthday, and now their engagement party, but they would be getting married later that night.
They went to get changed, and about an hour later, a justice of the peace arrived, some witness papers were signed, and a brief ceremony with custom vows took place. All very sudden. Very few people knew ahead of time, basically only people who had to travel long distances to be there, and my cousin who runs a freelance video production business and so they got him to bring his good camera (which kind of tipped him off a bit). My parents had no idea beforehand. They paid for the entire thing themselves.
TBH I think it was the best wedding I've ever been to, and I hope to some day do something similar.
 My sister threw a surprise wedding, everything went better than expected.
My wife and I had a whirlwind relationship and were married around one year after meeting.  We both agreed at that time that we didn't want a traditional “big wedding” and instead went to the San Francisco courthouse (which is beautiful by the way - if you want a courthouse wedding that is the one) and had a great moment together at the top of steps.  It was just my wife, myself, a friend of ours who had recently returned from Iraq (witness) and the judge.  It was special to us.  However – since no other family or friends were there, our marriage was never fully qualified in their eyes.  For years we were treated as if we were just dating.  Over time we regretted not having at least SOMETHING a little more involved.  I agree that other people shouldn’t be “forced to dress up and stare” as the OP had put it – but honestly I believe that there needs to be some celebration between friends and family to mark this change in your life.  If your friends can't be bothered to come together and wipe the crumbs out of their beards to celebrate your marriage, they need to hit the bricks.  I never wanted a “big wedding” but at this point, I honestly regret not having a wedding at all.  Years later, friends of ours were married at the same San Francisco courthouse.  They dressed up, had a photographer, a small group of friends/family, etc - they didn't spent a lot, but it made a HUGE difference. 
– Didn’t have a traditional wedding – wished we would have had something small to mark the importance of the event. 
I do that all the time, I'll often find myself going best of 3 if the first toss isn't to my liking.
 If the first toss doesn't satisfy, do it twice more.
On cultural dependency. I'm not referring to "ethnic" or any group of people NOT organized by their geographic/economic positions. And I am not saying it's a culture's fault for becoming dependent.
For example, Native Americans on reservations. During the 50's there was a government attempt to break up the reservations and give them welfare, and send them to cities or subsidize rural farming etc. This was an attempt to assimilate the culture of that ethnic group. It resulted in a catastrophic destruction of native culture that has been under seige for hundreds of years.
Now, reservations are epicenters of some of the worst poverty in the nation.
Welfare, especially ethnically targeted welfare, is a terrible system.

As for corporate bailouts, those were absolutely terrible. And Bush is about as guilty as Obama for them, he started TARP. The banks have NOT been responsible with the bailout money, and they simply used it to pad their books and keep their investors from jumping ship.
Why else is the stock market artificially doing well, while unemployment is going up rather than down? Because corporate bailouts do absolutely nothing for the people in poverty that do need help.

**** People in poverty need economic help. Welfare does the exact opposite of help. It suppresses their economic options. Education, and employment are the best way to help.
Welfare on a small scale, such as disability, or temporary unemployment is a good safety net. Our current welfare state targets ethnic groups, and is a corrupt vote farm. Why are inner city schools terrible, while the welfare infrastructure works?
Bailouts are just payoffs to keep rich people rich when they fail at capitalism and economics.
Same idea as OP.  Was with a controlling abusive boyfriend for 5 years (all throughout my teenage years).  Broke up with him.  Reconnected with the high school friends that I wasn't allowed to hang out with.  Went through hell with missing him and toying with the idea of getting back together with him.  I met a guy through my new group of friends that I was interested in but didn't put too much stock into.  My ex-boyfriend came over my house the day after x-mas with the intent of proposing to me (found out later through family) but I couldn't get the other guy out of my head so I kicked my ex-boyfriend out of my house.  I haven't spoken to or seen my ex-boyfriend since.  I am now living with my new boyfriend (the one that I was interested in) and happier than I have ever been.
 Ex-boyfriend is a douche bag.  Happier now with new boyfriend.
I don't think fear-based arguments are suitable for use with even mildly intelligent people.
That said, I do agree with your TL/DR. Flies, honey, vinegar. It's not exactly rocket science.

Use my argument:  "If you don't want to own guns, that's your choice.  Just don't take mine, because then I can't provide cover fire while you are running for your life." 
My experience with the average anti-gun opinionated person is that they generally have never really held an intelligent conversation on gun rights with someone from the opposite side of the fence.  Case in point, while on vacation with my family, I met a native of New York City, a really "Average Joe"-type, almost stereotypical older New Yorker.  (I'm from Mississippi and about 20 years younger, by the way.  Hom much further apart on the spectrum can you get?)  After about 20 minutes of polite conversation, I had him convinced that gun control was not feasible as a way to reduce crime, that the definition of an "assault weapon" would outlaw the majority of hunting rifles used today should a ban ever be pushed through, and that the only reason the government would have to take away the right of the citizens to arm themselves is to prevent them from fighting back against that government.  Of course, some sheople will never be convinced because they are afraid of personal responsibility and think the government best knows how to take care them and would never agree to my above statements.
**TL/DR:**  It's not always what you say, it's how you say it.  And you'll never win over everybody.

**EDIT:**  It was a freakin' joke people, learn to loosen up and you might have more success with your arguments.  That's the one I pull out on the hardcore gun restriction supporter that thinks only the police and military should be armed.  They can never be convinced anyway, so a useless argument based upon a fear scenario is a perfectly legitimate response at that point in the conversation.  Now, thanks for coming out, don't forget to tip the wait staff and I'll be here all week.
I met a girl once after I had gotten into some trouble with the law and they ordered that I start seeing a therapist. I was pretty insecure about the relationship because she came from money and I'm kind of a poor city kid. We were really getting along, but I finally broke if off when she had to move across the country for medical school and I refused to go with her.
I was pretty disappointed the relationship ended, I think, but I swallowed hard and didn't let it get to me. My therapist told me I might grow up never really knowing anybody if I abandon everyone that gets close to me. That kind of shook me up, but then he gets up and keeps saying "It's not your fault. It's not your fault" over and over again and I finally break down and start crying as all the emotions of my miserable childhood come out. After that, I decided to go see about the girl.
I refused a job at the NSA to hook up with a girl in California.
I like achievements and all, but it's rare that I'll play something to 100% completion! 

Dead Rising broke me of the habit when I learned what I would have to go through for a measley 20 points! (7-day survivor, etc). This is valuable time I could spend with other games!

If it's fun, I'll play to 100% completion. If it's a total grind-fest, then Fuck It!
I, too, would like to know the real story, but here is what gets me...
It may or may not have been the wrong choice, I have no basis to make such a claim, but Haley did nothing wrong (as in illegal). People are attempting to stir the political issue pot simply because they don't like the decision, and because they don't like Haley.
First, adding the "Tea Party" to the title is only helping to enrage those who don't care for the "Tea Party."  From all we can tell in the story, this has nothing to do with the Tea Party.
Second, using the word "unjustifiably" is attempting to imply Haley performed some illegal act. She did not. She doesn't have to justify it, as it was well within her right at Governor to do so.
Third, $4500 is nothing in terms of political fundraising or donations. As Warlizard point out, the person who was removed pledged $70M.  To me this sounds the decision to remove Moore was more person on Haley's part than it was political.  
Realistically, a more accurate (non-political spewing) headline for this submit would be **SC Governor Nikki Haley removes respected woman who from USC Board of Trustees, replacing her with Lexington attorney.**
What I see here (in this title) is what's wrong with politics today.  Everyone wants to whip up anger and demonize the other side.  Stick to the issue, not the emotion. Use the facts to make the point.
 This is not a "political or left v. right issue." I'm not saying don't be enraged.  I'm saying be enraged for the right reasons and use the facts to make the point. 

Reply: yes.
Two right-wing parties splits the opposition to the liberal one. That's why it was so very, very, important for the Republicans to AstroTurf the Tea Party into existence, then assimilate it before the zeal over the powdered wig pronouncements of Republican snake-oil tent-church revivals along with a small but enthusiastic band of American colonial fetishist cosplay  society members had faded, and that yes, despite 30 plus years and all of their votes, two terms of Reaganomics and three of Bushonomics had left a trickle-down mess that found Americans working ever harder for ever less compensation. They told you that if millionaires got taxes cuts, you'd one day be a millionaire too. The millionaires got tax cuts and became multimillionaires; Joe Q. America got screwed.
Then we were told that if only multimillionaires were to receive yet *bigger* tax cuts, the taps would start flowing; the milk and honey would flow for all who put in a good, honest day's work. So, the multimillionaires got their tax cut, and they became billionaires, and multibillionaires. Joe Q. America? Well, he got . . . I think you see where this is headed, nay?
Now Joe Q. America has been fired, denied healthcare, seen the teachers that taught his children to read and add foreclosed upon. Then, one fine day Joe gets an "Order to Vacate" "his" home, as the multiple trillions our Titans of Finance extracted from him in GWB's late 2008, (*pre-election of Obama* treasure raid, so don't try to blame it on him,
But it's not enough for them. They want more. They'll come for more too, as long as a man, spouse and children can be driven into the street to increase their holdings. They would -- and have, *literally,* bulldozed houses rather than see anyone live in them.
 You got fucked, Joe Q. America, and so did everyone whose parties *you'll* never be invited to. To the extent that the sociopathic economists  care or even note your death throes on the altar of Ayn Rand, it will be only with sadistic delight at your sufferings before death.
Does that answer your question?

Ive got a lot of stories but my two favourites are 
1.
when the [Glasgow ice cream wars]( were going on when i was a youngster, I remember seeing a ice cream van getting [petrol bombed]( 
I had just bought a packet sweets and juice from the van and a couple of minutes later just after we were about to play football again, then we heard shouting and a loud bang. The bang was the petrol bomb exploding and it destroyed the van with it. The van driver had dived out the window just before it exploded and ran away, closely followed by the guy who threw the petrol bomb
2
One of my neighbours was screaming at the TV it was a day when [rangers were playing celtic]( in the football. He was drunk and causing hassle in his front garden. The police came and spoke to him and left him as his wife took him into the house. 
Later on (around 2hours later), the police came back to his house (two men), at this point i should mention we were sitting on a hill about 30m away watching this unfold, the police were chapping the door to get in. I heard shouting but never knew what was said until later. He was telling them to 'fuck off or ill kill you'. The police chapped the door again and the door flew open. He ran out screaming chasing the police down the stairs with A FUCKING AXE. 
The police ran away and since UK police dont have guns had to radio for Armed police to attend. 
It was at this point, when all the police sirens were going, my mum heard the noise and shouted me into the house and i missed the rest but it I heard they were in a stand off with him as he wouldn't drop the axe. All the time he was drinking his beer cans. He got time and i left the area.

***  growing up I saw an ice cream van get petrol bombed and a man who chased the UK police with an axe.
I have a great one, and I'll try not to be too long.
When I was a kid we had some neighbors who had 3 kids that started off as good friends when they moved in. The girl was cute, one brother was really fat, and the other was just kinda weird but ok. We would hang around and play, but one time it got a little rough playing football and the chubby kid ran home.  His mom comes out and starts shooting a bb gun at us.  That started it all, from then on the mother would just flip out anytime we walked near their house.  They built a 10 foot tall fence all the way around their yard so you couldn't see in at all.  The entire neighborhood turned against them cause they were crazy. Numerous altercations resulted in police calls, someone painted on their fence "Whore house 10 cents a fuck" and they attacked my brother once with a pipe and took his ball cap.  When my dad came home a friend ran up and said "they got jason" and he saw the ball cap come flying over the fence and thought they took him inside, so him and another neighbor ran over and kicked the gate in.
Eventually they had to take the fence down as it violated ordinances and they moved out.
Then a very recluse family moved in with two young daughters and the father got arrested for molestation.  We felt the house was cursed cause it burned down a while later.
- Crazy neighbors built a 10 foot tall fence to hide
Context before I start the story, I live in a relatively safe suburb. Crime rate is pretty low and we got rated in Forbes "top 50 small towns in America". Hopefully this gives a sense to my town.
One day my neighbors son(elementary school) is riding his bike and decides to ride to his elementary school without telling his Mom(about a mile from here). Mom freaks out and calls the police. Police find him and the first think she asks is "Oh my god, is he dead?". 
 Neighbors son rode off on a bike. She called police and assumed he was dead.
Oh boy, do I. When we were moving in, our U-Haul hit a tree in front of the neighbor across the street's house. It was a small tree, and no damage done, but he started flipping out. GF's dad was driving the truck, and he's a big man. He gets out, and neighbor retreats back to his porch.
Thought that was the end of things. I'd spoken to him a few times since then, and he seemed fairly level-headed, if a bit of a weirdo. One day recently (about 6 months after we'd moved in), I was at work and he invites himself into our house for coffee. GF told him, "No, we don't have time, house is a mess, etc." but he stuck his foot in the door and came inside. He starts poking his head around the house (probably trying to see if anyone else is home), while my GF gets the coffee pot to get him the fuck out of the house. He proceeds to tell her she has "purty eyes" (no embellishment on the redneck accent, really talks like this), and asks her if she wants to "fool around." She, naturally, tells him no. He asks, and I couldn't make this up, "Why not?" So GF flips out, tells the dude she's late for something and hustles him out of the house. Calls me in a panic once he's out, tells me to stay at work because she didn't want me to wind up in jail over this. 
Fast forward to a few days later. I'd told plenty of people about the incident, including my landlord, who had been stopping by for something unrelated. Crazy neighbor proceeds to leave my landlord a rambling, nigh-on-incoherent message about how our apartment is such a mess that he should call the health department and evict us. Much laughs between landlord, myself and GF, also because he just admitted he'd been in our house. He went over to the neighbor's place to tell him to just stay away or the cops will get involved. Interestingly enough, neighbor is apparently asleep (strange, considering the phone call happened within the hour), so landlord talked to his wife (!). No word since then, hopefully none ever. Bat behind the door just in case.
** We hit crazy neighbor's tree moving in, months later he hits on my GF, GF kicks him out LIKE A BOSS, he leaves drunk message on landlord's voicemail.**
Yes, I had a neighbor that was literally crazy.  I was managing a high-rise apartment complex that housed elderly and/or disabled persons, and was required to live onsite.  This particular resident suffered from severe mental illness and had massive paranoia.  She came into the office once to complain that someone broke into her apartment and rearranged the things in her kitchen cabinets.  No forced entry, nothing stolen... just things not where they were supposed to be.  

At first it wasn't too bad, but she would sometimes go off her meds and things would get ugly.  She'd be out on her balcony screaming at a neighbor across the street.  Sometimes swear words, sometimes just random noises.  Other nights she would march up and down the hallways screaming "SAVE ME JESUS!!  SAVE ME JESUS!!"

Eventually she became dangerous, and was threatening others and herself.  The final straw was when she urinated into a coffee cup and left it in the elevator... which was caught on the elevator camera.  I ended up having to go to an involuntary commitment hearing and having her committed for several weeks.

Crazy neighbor peed in a coffee cup and left it in the elevator... caught on film
I live in a house split into two flats, my roommates and I live upstairs, my crazy neighbor lives downstairs. About 2 months ago, she come up at 2 am, uninvited, while we were watching movies and starts in on me for never sharing the one parking spot with my roommate. My roommate then says to her it doesn't matter, but she persists, telling me that I take advantage of him for not sharing the spot, insists that I start paying for the spot, says she is going to call the landlord and pretty much calls me an asshole in front of 5 other people. The funny part is... she doesn't own a car and my roommate, a friend of mine for years, says he didn't say anything about it to her and doesn't care because he had been spending most of his time at his new girlfriends place for the last 2-3 weeks. 
Fast-forward to yesterday, I parked in the spot over night. This morning I wake up and look out the front window to see her parents car(borrowed for the week) parked diagonally across the front lawn. There is a parking lot across the street that is empty and there is parking all along the street.
TLDR - Crazy downstairs neighbor wants to use driveway but does not own a car.
Somewhere along these lines. A friend of mine who likes to drive down to Orlando to party received a phone call shortly after the [Casey Anthony murder mystery]( started. On the other end was a detective who had been assigned to call all the numbers in Casey Anthony's cell phone and see who they were and if they had any leads. He really had no clue what the hell was going on until pictures of her partying on facebook were released to the media, and he recognized both her, and the party.
***: Friend got drunk, fucked an accused child murderer, police found out and started asking questions.
I was telling my neighbor about how I ended up with my dog.  I explained that he'd come from the shelter, and that he had been through several people before ending up with my business partner.   
My business partner quit, and left the dog.  I told her that I never wanted a dog, but that since he had been abandoned so many times that I was not going to do that to him again.  
Instead of understanding that I was saying that, while I didn't previously want a dog, that because this dog had separation anxiety, and had already been dumped several times, that I was Not going to be like the rest of his owners. 
I came home to see that my dog wasn't.  A note on my door:  "We found a good home for your dog. He's in the San Juan Islands with a good friend of ours."   
W. T. F.    I was livid. My (very soon to be ex) wife went over there and chewed her a new one and he was brought back home.  I had him for 13 years. 
 My neighbors gave away my dog. 
I'm just going around the block here. I'm at neighbor number three. 
So, I grew up in the house I'm living at now.  We moved out, and my dad let one of his friends/employees live in the house.  That guy was growing pot in the basement and a ballast had blown and caught the house on fire.  It was totally gutted but, was still worth repairing. 
So, a few years later my dad basically gave me the house, and I'm rebuilding it.  One day I was working on a window, and noticed my neighbor looking at me.  I didn't pay much attention. This guy has probably lived there since I was a baby; I knew him.    
He just stares at me, and then goes in his house.  I look out the window again, and he has a rifle pointed at me.  I ducked, thought WTF, and went to another window to see that he'd gone back in his house. 
 Make sure your neighbors still recognize you. 
My Neighbour is a shift worker, so he is home during the day and works during the night. I work from home some days per week, but as a rule I make myself get up at 9am as if I were going to the office. He has two daughters, and over coffee I can watch him see them off to school. Two hours later, Beyoncé dvd is on, full blast... 50yo man, home alone.. Beyoncé dvd.
So in a terrible design flaw, His garage window overlooks our garden. As a means of privacy, my Mum put up a trellis of vine leaves.
Door knocks. 
"Get that off my fucking window"
Argument ensues about our privacy, and how it was a way of letting in light to his room, but give us privacy, or else he gets frosted windows put in, which he refused.
Two days into the feud, my 75 year old grandmother (who I must note is 4ft 11ins tall) - was babysitting my little brother alone one day, and visited the neighbour to attempt to settle the dispute over home made stew she made.
She went inside, and when she mentioned that she'd like to keep the trellis up, he threw her out, screaming at her "get fucked, its my window, get fucked" and when she got outside, he started screaming all over the street "she assaulted me, she assaulted me, I need witnesses, she assaulted me" - As my 75 year old diminutive Granny hobbled up the path, she came home crying, and couldn't believe what had just happened.
Then the police knocked on the door. Saying they are investigating alleged assault. and after talking to granny in the kitchen, burst out laughing when they realised how tiny and frail she was, and so went back to him, where he fessed up that she didnt hit him, and instead tried to say she threatened him with painting his windows, (again bollocks.)
So he got a fine for wasting police time.
My neighbour masturbates to his daughters Beyoncé DVDs when they go out, and called the police on my 75 year old 4ft 11 granny, accusing her of assault, when she tried to settle a dispute over his garage window overlooking our garden by bringing him home-made irish stew.

I'll never forget this, forever engraved in my memory. I'll try to not wall-of-text this:
I was about 17 at the time and it was the morning after I had a massive party with about 20-30 of my friends and we had been drinking on my backyard deck underneath one of those cheap, portable tent/gazebos you can find at Walmart. I came upstairs in search of a glass of water to deal with my massive hangover. This was when I noticed that there was a huge wind/rain/shit storm assaulting my backyard, knocking bottles and tossing around the portable gazebo. 
As I ran outside to wrestle the gazebo from blowing away, I noticed my neighbour and her boyfriend staring at me from their kitchen window, her boyfriend full out pointing and *laughing* at me. By now the gazebo resembled very little of it's original form and I was being thrashed in the face with heavy rain, wind, and the nylon roof of the gazebo. Enraged at this asshole getting off on such schadefreude, I flipped him the bird and told him to fuck off. 
I get that it was combination of my loud party and finger gesture that set him over the edge, but there was no way I could have anticipated for what happened next. In the midst of a torrential downpour, he ran outside, climbed over my fence (take note this man is 240+lbs and in his late 50s/early 60s) and began circling me and verbally threatening me (*"I'll fucking rip off your balls and choke you with them!" "Every bottle cap and beer can I find on this side of the fence I'm going to fucking shove up your ass!"*). Not wanting to underestimate what this guy was capable of I grabbed one of the remaining legs of the gazebo to defend myself while I yelled at my sleeping mother to call the police. Fortunately my neighbour (his girlfriend) was able to calm him down enough before he was able to attack me, but it was still one of the most terrifying things that has ever happened to me. 
Since then, the story has spread to the rest of the people on my street and he has now become vilified along with my neighbour, and my mum (who used to be best friends with her) still doesn't speak with him.
** Neighbour's bf jumped over fence and tried to attack me after I flipped him off for laughing at me trying to secure a gazebo during an intense storm the morning after I had a party.**
My old neighbor was literally insane. Paranoid schizophrenic i believe. He lived with his mom and used to sit on a lawn chair in his garage alone all day staring out at the street at all hours of the day. I literally remember leaving my house at 2 am to drive a friend home and him still being out there. His garage was filled with beer cans and ash trays. I think he randomly had a mannequin in there with him towards the end. The cops had been called on him plenty of times before and his most amusing run in with the law was when he was arrested for DUI and evading the police in 5 mph car chase.
This summer his mom was gone visiting other family and left him alone for a week. During that time I and the rest of my neighbors started getting a little uneasy because he had stopped sitting in his garage, even though he was home. We were in my house and I looked out the window and saw a couple cop cars. I walked out into our courtyard and a cop immediately came up to me and told me to go back into my house because the area was "incredibly unstable" The next few hours I sat in my house watching as 3 fire trucks 16 squad cars an ambulance a swat team and a hazmat team showed up. My family got a call from a family friend who was a sheriff who told us to make sure we were all inside and all of the windows and doors were sealed because there could be some kind of chemical agent in the air. Eventually they got him out of the house and into the squad car and had fans running in his house for the rest of the night to clear the air. Apparently he was cooking up some sort of a bomb and his mom came home early. When she opened the door to the house was exposed to some chemical in the air that burned her and she called the cops. It was a pretty crazy night.
Schizophrenic neighbor tried to build a bomb and the fire and police departments of 4 cities as well as a swat team, ambulance and hazmat team showed up at his house.
When I lived in Missouri, I lived out in the country...had about 4 neighbors. One of them was a guy in his mid 40's, and he had at LEAST 50 dogs. Seriously, we counted once. I'm sure he had more, but that's what we saw that day. He did not have a big house at all. I would guess a one bedroom. His yard was about an acre. He'd bring home 3 huge bags of dog food every single day. I can say with absolute certainty that being near his house was the absolute worst smell I've ever encountered, and I have been around rotting dead bodies. I'm almost certain that they eat each other. Every once in a while one of them would have puppies (since none of them are fixed), and the puppies would slowly disappear. This would also partially explain the smell.
He was as socially awkward as they come. He had a huge crush on my mom for a couple of years. He would send her cards and invited her out to dinner to McDonalds. Seriously.
We tried calling the humane society and other organizations several times but unfortunately they just don't care out there.
 crazy ass neighbor had about 50 dogs, smelled like death.
You asked, so here goes...
It was early September, and I had been living in my new house for a few weeks when a neighbor lady came by at 10am. I was wicked hungover and was out in the backyard drinking coffee while my kids played outside. She showed up wearing high heels, leggings, an Adidas sweatshirt, and a fancy broach. In her hands, she was holding a homemade loaf of zucchini bread and asked to hang out for a while.
In the following ten minutes, I learned that: 1) she was 50 years old, 2) she had had four miscarriages, 3) she wished that she was a great writer like me (I only told her that I taught English at the college), 4) our 90-year-old neighbor is a lesbian whose life partner recently passed, 5) she is *very, very wealthy* (said in a southern drawl), and 6) she wanted me to come over.
I was i shock when I heard all of this and assumed she wasn't well, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Granted, I was hungover as all get-out and really wanted to see where this was going to go. 
When we got to her house, the first thing I noticed was a half-smoked joint on the counter top along with the plastic wrap and curling ribbon she used to wrap my zucchini bread in. She fed me and my kids with this amazing cheesy biscuit she whipped up from scratch and poured me a few amazing glasses of chardonnay (yes, all before 11am). 
Although she didn't have any kids of her own and was herself an only child, she had an amazing space dedicated to her spouse's nieces and nephews. My kids were content playing every board game and video game possible and had absolutely no interest in coming upstairs.
Miss Tina ended up telling me her life story about how she was raised in a wealthy family but chose to become a nurse for her love of the field. She worked until she turned 50 and had become recently retired. She asked if I wanted a tour of her two-story house, and of course, I said yes.
Upstairs was a dream come true. Her "guest" bathroom (I use the term "guest" because she clearly hadn't had anyone in there for several years) was super dusty, and the guest tub was full of dying houseplants. The master closet, on the other hand, was another story.
When we walked in her closet, there was a familiarly unfamiliar scent in the air. I asked what it was and was met with ten fucking sprays of Coco Chanel straight on the skin. I couldn't shake it for several hours and noticed many people sitting next to me at a football game soon after kept moving away from me. One woman actually said it was because my perfume was so offensive.
After seeing several outdated purses, shoes, hats, and whatnot, I kindly asked to make way downstairs. Much as she had done in the previous hours (yes, hours), Miss Tina had indicated that she was Italian and that it was her "cultural obligation" to not let me leave her house without some stuff.
After a couple hours of smoking pot, drinking wine, and looking at her shit, I ended up leaving her house with an $18 tube of brand-new lip gloss, an authentic Scottish cashmere scarf, and a trenchcoat (because they were "so in" in 2009).
- I left a rich woman's house knowing her deepest darkest secrets with a buzz, some expensive lip gloss, a fancy scarf, and an outdated trenchcoat. 
about six months into our lease on our beautiful (but modest) apartment, these dirty hipsters move into the first floor. (we live on the third, two female young-professionals - on the second.)
one particular night i get home from work around 3:30am to find a nice trail of crushed PBR cans (typical) leading up the stairs to a gleaming pile of chunky vomit on our landing directly outside our apartment door. awesome. because we're one of the few apartments in NYC without roof access (some sort of "safety hazard" nonsense, not-stable, blah blah blah) they had no reason to even be in this area of the building.
we also live on a block smack-dab between two fairly busy brooklyn bars - needless to say, extremely high foot-traffic, extremely loud noise (which btw, definitely does not bother me. if you can live out a year lease on st. mark's, you can sleep through anything.) despite all that, the girls on the first floor managed to have the cops called on them on four separate occasions in the span of three months -- for what i could only assume to be noise complaints... my guess is either the asian family in the building next door or the girls on the second floor.
the icing on the cake came when the wall between their kitchen and living room went up in flames because they PLUGGED TOO MUCH SHIT INTO ONE DAMN OUTLET, and we were awoken, after closing our respective bar shifts late the night before, at 10am by the FDNY (hook &amp; ladder 108 southside, thank you kindly!) pounding on our bedroom door. we spent the rest of the late morning/early afternoon barefoot in our courtyard watching the firefighters hose down the first floor apartment while smoke filtered through ours. it was more annoying than horrifying because although they DESTROYED their own apartment, ours was fine (we only had to have the first response guys, who ironically enough, seem to be the *last* ones on the scene after a fire, "wash" down our walls, something about smoke stains and then spend the next 48 straight hours having two industrial sized fans circulating air through our apartment) -- all the tenants and animals were fine.
needless to say they got evicted not too long after that three cool dudes moved in -- and everything's back to normal. fucking hipsters.
**edit:** holy shit, that was long.
**** hipsters stuck, FDNY rules, i love brooklyn.
Ohhhhhh man I wish I saw this thread 14 hours ago. Let me tell you a tale or two.
As a former house renter, I know how it feels to put up with a lot of shit around you. I used to live off a busy street in San Diego well-known for its run-down prostitutes, random gunshots in the back alleys, colorful drug-dealers, and best of all...very limited street parking. So the bucket of stories is always full.
I used to have a neighbor named Elvis (black guy, go figure) that I was cool with for a while. His demeanor went downhill over the months and for the past couple days he would sit out on the dead grass of his apt complex and smoke with random dudes. One day in the middle of the afternoon he was walking away from a van's driver window (must've been a buddy) and proceeded to sit back down on his outdoor chair. A minute later a cop rolls by, gets out the car and asks Elvis to come over to talk to him by the chain-link mid-high fence, which he complies. 
As I watch what's going on from across the street, I notice after a minute of talking the cop, another cop car rolls in. Elvis gets antsy as the cop asks him come around the fence. 
The angel dust must've kicked in or something 'cause the king made a b-line back to his apartment. Somehow he escapes the grab from the first cop, and dodges the other cop and yells out for his wife in the apt, **"Linda! Linda! Call the police! Call the fucking police!**. Somehow he makes it back up the stairs to his apt and locks the door. 
Eventually the street gets shutdown as about 10 cop cars pull in and rush up the complex. After a 15 min standoff. they arrest him and is no longer seen for about 6 months as he's doing his time.
One day he comes knocking on my door asking if I could fill up a piss cup for him for his upcoming job interview. Remembering how delusional he was, I wasn't sure if he would actually drink it or put it to good use...so I actually denied him my golden juice. Never talked to me after that day. Did I do wrong?
Oh and I have more stories.
***: Doped-up neighbor yells at his wife to call the police as cops were chasing him in his apt complex. 6 months later he asks me fill up his piss cup for a job interview and I denied him. More stories upon request.
Either my neighbors have been normal or I was too young/sheltered to know of any abnormal occurrences.
HOWEVER, my cousin's neighbors, when I was a kid anyway?  Did a bunch of weird and sketchy stuff not worth writing too much about and then randomly, in the dead of night, STOLE THEIR GIANT GODDAMN TRAMPOLINE.  Yes, a giant 25' metal trampoline.  They partially disassembled it and drug all of it into their garage.  How was this obvious?  Because the drag marks were there in the grass the next morning, leading right to their garage.  And when they opened their garage, my aunt and uncle saw their partially disassembled 25' trampoline stuffed in there.  Unless aliens made the drag marks to fuck with my aunt and uncle and these neighbors randomly stowed a sloppily deconstructed 25' trampoline in their garage for shits and giggles.  
If you've ever put together a trampoline, especially one that size, you know what a bitch it is to assemble and disassemble in daylight.  So I'm not surprised that it was a hack job at night.
Weird thing is, they never even attempted to set it up in their backyard.  Presumably, because a stolen trampoline would be obvious in the lot adjacent to the lot it was stolen from.  I think my aunt and uncle called the cops on them and it turned into a messy dispute, but ended when bigger charges came against these weirdos and they basically skipped town and left a bunch of shit -- yes, even a 25' trampoline -- in their garage/house.
crazy next-door neighbors stole 25' trampoline from my cousins, attempted to stash it in half-deconstructed state in garage.
This shit has GOT to be archived!  Priceless comments here...
I have one.  Not as good as most of these, but really weird none the less.
When I was young (13-14) my dad had an apartment in Mississauga.
Everyday for a few hours we would hear what sounded like bowling balls drop and roll on the floor.  This puzzled us for over a year, and then finally my curiosity could take no more.  I knocked on the guys door upstairs.  I asked him what those sounds were and he looked at me with crazy eyes, (i suppose gaging weather to be honest or lie) and confessed that he would watch CP24 (a tv news ticker channel) and drop large marbles on the floor 1 per minute, on the minute.  He would wait for the time to change, and drop another one and let it roll all over the sloped hardwood floor.
Funniest part is when I asked him why he did it, he said "I like the sound of rolling marbles. "   ROFL.  I honestly tried my hardest, but could not hold back the laughter.  I kinda thought he was fucking with me, but he never stopped, and the sound is..... otherwise unexplainable.  It was annoying as fuck, but we would just crank some tunes and try to ignore it.  This man would literally sit there for hours at a time (1 - 6 hours) dropping large marbles 1 per minute.
  Upstairs crazy man would drop marbles on the floor one at a time, timed to the changing of the clock.(1 a minute, on the minute)
I'm the bad guy:
When I lived in a townhouse, one of my neighbors married a South American Woman that had two soccer mad children. 
The back of the houses were unfenced and these two kids from her previous relationship(s) would play soccer at all hours. In the summer months, the "smack" sound of a kicked ball and the shrieks and screams of these two boys would start in the morning and continue until the sun set in the evenings. 
The layout of the buildings made our back door nearer the action than that of the neighbors in question. Our complaints were laughed off, they heard the noise as "not that bad", from our living room it was as if they were kicking right behind us. It was awful, and it got to be all consuming. When they weren't kicking the ball, we sat on edge awaiting the noise to start. Again.
 
One day the screams were as shrill as I'd ever heard...and I lost it. I stormed out and screamed at the little bastards for what felt like an eternity. I vented. Big time. I doubt my tirade was more than ten seconds long, but when I was done I was absolutely shaking.
One of them looked up at me and said "Mister, we're only kids". I walked back inside and felt like shit for the next month.
Not my proudest moment, and I can't explain why I did it. I'd just had enough.
 Soccer balls are loud...not as loud (or crazy) as I am.
I live in a fairly laidback desert community in Cali but I've gone through a few crazy neighbors. One was an older man who liked taking pictures of us kids when we were in the above-ground pool until we had to it take it down. He would walk around in his back yard naked sometimes, probably fappin. My mom called the cops on him, but there was no apparent proof so nothing happened. Fast forward a few years of reletive quiet: a visiting 12 year old cousin catches him getting the news paper naked at around 8AM on a summer day with loads of other young kids outside. The police took him away then. We eventually found out that he was a serious alcoholic with diabetes. More creepy than crazy I guess.
The other came in a set of coke addled hillbilly types that moved in across the street from us. We got along with the family pretty well for about a year when out of nowhere they would refuse to talk to anybody in my family claiming we stole some car part or gardening tool of theirs. They'd randomly paint our garage door and porch with paintballs. One time the dad had gone off to the store with his oldest daughter and half way down the street he pushed her out of their car. Eventually they moved away without further incident.
**** lived next door to a pedophile and junkie rednecks moved in across the street.
Pretty low-key for this thread but thought I'd share.
Live in a really nice neighborhood just outside of DC (less than 5 miles from capital, 1/4 mile from Pentagon.) As you would expect there are a lot of military people in my neighborhood. Eventually a former Marine moved in next door. He had a green HUMVEE and parited all the time as evidence of his beer can/liquor bottle filled recycling bins. One day, while I was at college, he hired a couple to have sex infront of him through craigslist. Apparently, the man of the couple was a unhonroably discharged former Navy SEAL. According to police reports/neighbor gossip, the Marine tried to join in on the fun, and they got in a fight. Apparently the girl was passed out in the hot tub (something VERY hard to do), and the Marine and Seal got into a serious fist fight. The Marine ended up shooting the marine several times, tried to clean up the crime scene, then called the cops claiming someone had broken in and he shot them. When the girl woke up, she was in a police interogation room, and immeaditly walked into in the Washington winter cold, after refusing to answer the questions. They guy got off scott free and moved away ASAP. My Dad even got interviewed where he said "no plus or minus of the guy" that i still make fun of him for.
Live out side of dc, Marine hired couple on craigslist to have sex, epic marine vs SEAL battle that ends with dead SEAL. Also, my dads a goober.
cant find vid of my dad saying dumb stuff but heres a crazy letter form him 
My index and middle fingers on my right hand went through cogs (on a friends handmade merry go round), they were completely separate except for a few nerves and a bit of muscle.
They were able to save the fingers, even though I wasn't operated on til 16 hours after the accident but I have almost no sensitivity on the top half of those fingers which can be really dangerous. I often don't realise if I've burnt them on a pan or left them in a candle flame etc.
I've got rope like scars on both fingers because I didn't do massage therapy properly, in the future that may cause my fingers to cramp up kind of like a [claw]( meaning I can't use those fingers properly, which will probably lead to me not being able to use that whole hand properly. They had some trouble fixing my fingernails as well. My index one is quite small and doesn't grow, it gets cut by a doctor once a year but it doesn't really need it. My middle one is quite wide and has to be cut at least twice a week.
But I'm just thankful I have both my fingers, no stubs or fake ones.
 fingers went through cogs but were saved.
I guess I found this a wee bit too late, but I actually have a story to contribute with for once. This is gonna be a long story, so hang on...
I was living with my mom and step-dad in a house in my late teens. It was in the middle of summer and we were building a pond in the backyard. This is in a nice neighbourhood in Sweden, just outside a big town where we had just moved in a couple of months earlier. Anyway, guy comes over and introduces himself as the guy who just (minutes beforehand, apparently) bought the house next door. He's a very jolly fellow; think your stereotypical movie neighbour, sort of like Ned Flanders, without the obviously religious part. He even introduced himself as "Your crazy new neighbours!!" when he shook our hands, and said that "We looked like a jolly good bunch!". As he left I remember looking at my step-dad and shrugging, he doing the same thing to me. We agreed that he seemed nice, if very weird.
At the day of the move-in, we remarked between ourselves that they had hired very weird movers. They looked like your typical drug-addicts and bikers, but knowing how awkward and happy-go-lucky the family man that hired them appeared, we figured he was just doing a favour for the less fortunate in society. That's cool.
We talk to his family a bit over the coming weeks. Turns out it's "Flanders", his wife and her two sons in their mid-teens. They own a cleaning company apparently, if the vans with "cleaning company"-labels were any indication. Weird people show up now and then, bikers and such, but we pay it no mind.
Then all of a sudden the guy disappears. We see his wife and her kids as usual, but he's just gone one day. That's when we start to place a few clues together.
One guy we recognised from the newspaper turned up, one day. Apparently he was the son of hers from a previous marriage. We recognise him because a few years earlier, he had been in a central leadership position of a very large neo-Nazi movement that stretehed over all of Sweden, but had since "left that life behind".
A few days later we meet a couple of other neighbours at the local mall. Apparently they had heard a few rumours about the disappearance of Ned; it seemed his Cleaning-firm was a front for selling drugs, and he faced 3 years in prison. Things suddenly started making sense.
We don't hear much for the coming year, but still see the occasional car drive past our drive way, still see the occasional junkie come by our neighbours house, etc.
Then one day the summer after we had a barbeque in our backyard with some relatives. Everything is fine, the meat is on the grill, we're talking, drinking wine, enjoy ourselves. All of a sudden we hear the sound of tires screeching from the front. The bark of dogs, and screaming. Sirens, and flashing lights. We hear sounds of panic from the backyard next to us, divided by tall bushes. One of the sons next door suddenly barge through the bushes, does a double-take as he sees the crowd looking back in confusion, throws a bag with a white substance in the pond, then sprints away. After him, two fully armed cops emerge with dogs. They release the hounds, who sprint after him, and take him down. I was watching this all thinking I was seeing a movie. One of the cops sprint towards him, with the dog growling over his form, while the other turns to us, asks us "Sorry about this. Did he have something on him?". We dumbly point towards the pond. The police walks over, takes the zip-lock bag, mumbles a thanks and they head towards the front with another word, the neighbour long since in restraints being escorted with them.
My parents never quite managed to live up to that barbeque again.
Ned Flanders turned out to be dealing drugs.
My fiancé and I are peaceful, friendly, openminded people. We thought moving from the hectic jersey shore to farm country in western jersey would be a pleasant change.
We were WRONG. Since day one (we moved there this past may) we have been told we "don't belong in these here parts". 
We are quiet, hardworking, and keep to ourselves. On days off we walk the long country trails with our dog. Apparently this is very irritating to the locals (???). 
Our apartment is in a 200 year old general store. It's a HUGE house/property that has:
     
     •3 rental units located in the building containing a storefront
     •a pizza shop recently opened inside the storefront
     •a detached garage with a studio apartment above
     •a big red barn converted into a car magnet shipping business,
      where we work as a second job
     •a huge 'open parking' lot for everyone to park
     •a tiny post office where the only employee is the town's
      actual postmaster
     •a very cool consignment shop above the post office
     •across the street is a horse farm, sheep and goats and
      a bison farm
All of this adds up to about 2 acres and is considered one property where each tenant and business pay their rent to a single owner. Sounds like a nice little community, no?
Well, moving in we were told we are "dirty, retarded hippies" so word to the wise, a peace symbol on your car will bring chaos.
Then we were told that we parked in our neighbor's girlfriend's spot. Apparently if we didn't move IMMEDIATLY he would have our car disappear in the middle of the night and be unable to prove it was him because his brother is a cop in next town over. We apologized and said we were told it was open parking. This must've been an outlandish response because the guy totally lost his shit and threatened to make us disappear! He said if we ever walked on the lawn by his door, he would "shoot to kill"!
We were so baffled. Everytime we go outside he harasses us, screaming and intimidating us.   A few weeks ago he was taking out his garbage and passed us standing by our car and yelled "fuckin niggers! I can't wait till you die!!" not that it matters, because NO ONE should be spoken to that way...but I am a 30yr old white girl (5'2") and my fiancé is a 28yr old white boy (6'1") and we are the epitamy of pacifists. A man at the house next door heard the whole thing go down and just turned and went into his home.
The next day we had an egg thrown at our car and over a hundred sheet rock nails thrown all around our car to try and cause a flat. Btw, our harrasser works in construction.
Because of the old house is set up, this guy controls the thermostat to all 3 apartments and freezes us out all winter. He also has access to the basement from his apartment which contains the fuse boxes. He learned that our alarm goes off a 6am each morning, so he has started throwing the fuse at about 5:45am so we will be late for work. 
The other day he cornered my fiancé in the parkinglot and started screaming "you're such a fuckin faggot with your poofy curly hair and druggie hippy clothes. You guys are the bottom of the barrel scrubbing toilets for a living! I wish you were dead! What's a matter faggot? Did you leave your balls upstairs with your girlfriend?? This will never stop unless you move! We don't want you here!!! Fucking die faggot!" ETC ETC 
Just to clarify, we work our asses off cleaning houses with all natural products. It's laborious  and exhausting and we commute over an hour each way to get to our clients. On top of that, we housesit, petsit, and nanny for our customers. On our days off, we work in the magnet barn on the property (50 foot commute +exta cash =win!). We really are duper nice mellow people trying our darndest in life and I am SO SICK of dealing with our shitty ass neighbor!!!!
Oh and he's only like 2 inches taller than me (napoleon complex) and drives a huge monster pick up truck. His newest thing is placing a running vacuum or stereo speakers on full blast right next to our bedroom wall. Sigh.
Lastly, our landlord plays dumb and pretends there isn't anything he can do about it. Now we only go outside if we have tape recorders in our pockets so we can catch proof of the harassment. We also bought and installed security cams because the guy lived in our place before switching to the bigger one he's in now, and still has keys to our place. If we can get enough proof we are going to take it to the county prosecuter.
WE HAVE A NEIGHBOR FROM HELL
    neighbor from hell harasses us and shouts terroristic threats all the time. we can't      even report it because his brother is a cop in next town over and crazy runs in the family 
While it probably would have been for the better if those terms did not come into their current usage, it's a little late to change, as both have become quite separated from their original definitions (I've never heard either used in non-technical literature, and both have more common and acceptable terms now such as "physically disabled" and "mute").
Gay, on the other hand, is a term that has been reclaimed, like the N word, that a group of people commonly identifies with. In addition, gays are an invisible minority. This means that people may use the word gay in a negative connotation in front of a closeted person and not even realize what mental distress they are causing (on top of those purposefully trying to denigrate gays.
 While it's not really a good thing, using gay in such a way probably does worse.
Races originated because of geographic isolation causing different groups to adapt to different local environmental conditions. Within each isolated groups, you only had the traits present within that group to select from; from this, the norm for each group became to only have preferences for individuals within their group that had specific traits. Now that geographic isolation is not even a factor, with the advent of intra and international travel, and rapid long range communication, people suddenly have a whole new set of traits to choose from, meaning that their preference may be completely different from their ancestral groups norm. When you stray from this ancestral norm and prefer someone of a different race, it becomes a fetish only because it has not yet become the norm. As time goes on and different races of people are able to interbreed more and more, it will no longer be considered a fetish; mindsets are just really slow to change.
tl;dr
We can only choose from those traits that are present, and our ancestors only had those traits present that were within their race that was largely geographically isolated. Now we have traits from all kinds of different races/groups to choose from. The problem is that people and society are slow to change.
The issue isn't the inherent difference itself, it's what people make of it.  If you're not blonde and have a preference for blondes, it's usually not because you love how "different" and "exotic" blondes are, but because they have been presented as a beauty ideal for quite some time. Blonde is not as strongly associated with a certain culture or range of cultures as "Asian" is. To me, an Asian _fetish_ is where the idea of difference gets elevated to the point that fetishists are admiring this other culture as one might observe an exotic animal.
I'm an Asian female and I think there is a difference between someone having an Asian preference and an Asian fetish, and we should be careful to distinguish the two. To me, someone can have a preference for Asians--perhaps they grew up in an area with many Asian friends, for instance--and that's sincere and normal and just like someone having a preference for blondes. That doesn't bother me at all. A fetishist is someone who seeks out Asians for their "Asianness". If I found out a guy was interested in me _primarily_ because of my ethnicity, that would bother me.
Asian preference - normal and not creepy. Equivalent to preferring blondes. Asian fetish - racist undertones and creepy.
Executive Summary instead of TLDR? For shame.
For a while they planned on using the social commenting system on their own sites. They also planned on nonreddits using reddit's bones (i.e. lipstick.com (defunct? basically a fashiony women's reddit), which is what actually precipitated the take over). 
I think they expected to be able to integrate it much better with wired than they ended up managing. For a while reddit was strongly tech focused, but as time has progressed the focus broadened, and no longer was nearly as good a fit. That had severe consequences for the ability to sell ads (more or less they had a lot of users, but a lot of those user's weren't in any demographic that Conde Nast sold to (Fashion, Lifestyle, and a smidge of Tech mid-early adopter/gadget freak), and that really hurt them. Without the right connections (and almost as importantly the right associations in ad buyer's minds) they couldn't fill an utterly massive amount of ad space. Reddit has a [billion]( pageviews a month, and almost all of those need ads, which is just a massive volume. 
they thought they were buying Slashdot, and a forum system, and simply weren't well placed to make money off of what they got. 
Disclosure: I'm a software engineer at FactSet.  This is a throwaway account.
As far as I know there are no plans for a death march or layoffs nor do I see any indications of this.  FactSet has over 4000 employees so an increase of "hundreds" is still less than 10%.  I also think the "hundreds" statement is hyperbole (but I don't work in HR either).
There are a lot of projects here and typically each project will have a fairly small team.  I work on a team with 3 other programmers for example.  I haven't been working here very long, but this sort of structure isn't very conducive to company-wide death marches.
While financial software rarely gets people excited, working at FactSet is actually pretty nice.  We use a lot of different programming languages and a lot of different libraries (including open source libraries).  We use a good deal of "best practices" without going overboard - version control, code reviews, unit tests, etc.
- I think the "rapid expansion" is probably hyperbole and the work environment at FactSet is not what you expect.  Also, take everything I said with a grain of salt.
None.  I just got here a few months ago.  [This post I made a few weeks ago will explain my situation.](
The shotgun I have was purchased from a friend in PA.  I bought the Mosin from AIM.  I haven't found a shop or range yet in the area, I'm open to suggestions.  I was planning on cleaning the Mosin this afternoon (if UPS would hurry up and get here already!!) and taking it to one of the public ranges tomorrow.  
  I used to shoot when I was younger in NJ but never bothered as an adult because I didn't want to jump through the paperwork hoops.  Making up for lost time now.  
What I find to be the most helpful for me (and I'm the kind of person who could eat a whole box of Kraft Dinner) is reprogramming how I'm supposed to feel when I get up from a meal. I used to want to be "full", as in "can't eat another bite". Now I try to get up from meals feeling like "I could eat". Try to stave away the "stupid hungry" with well planned, higher protein snacks, around 100 cal 3x per day. (1 string cheese, or plain yogurt, or 15 almonds works well for me. Also keep hydrated! Drink water!!)
 You are most definitely not the only person who does this, but you can change it.
I had an ex who's family was from the midwest.  Their oldest son met a girl in Georgia and they planned to get married.  Both families were overwhelmingly Christian.  My gf's family planned for a wedding and bought tickets to fly down.  The minister in Georgia wanted the brother to jump through some more hoops so he called off the wedding.  Too late to get a refund on the tickets the gf's family decided to fly down anyway.  An aunt sold me her ticket so I went as well.
I was a closeted atheist.  I had no idea how bad the gf's family was, let alone how bad southern baptist could me.  The entire week was a passive aggressive showdown.  Saying grace at Denny's or ihop became a competitive sport.  Each time got louder, more thankful, more bibliscous.
Game night.  Gf's family was over at the other family's home to play trivial pursuit.  There was an exception, you could challenge any of the 'stupid questions that nobody would ever know' and try and name a bible quote that the other side picked out.
There were some obscure passages in the bible - then there are the people that can find those from memory.  Also, there are so many translations that going to the bible only causes more arguments.  I could answer the science questions, but we won because I knew Superman's fathers name was Zor-el.
Mooslims and communist are all that keep Christians from turning on each other.
I read through it all and don't exactly have a firm grasp of everything said, but I wholeheartedly applaud the amount of work you put in.

..at least according to this non-finance expert's brief research.
In the [WI Annual Financial Report from 2009](ftp://doaftp04.doa.state.wi.us/doadocs/2009CAFR_Linked.pdf), on page 61 in note 1, section D, entitled "Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation" it reads:
&gt; The  government-wide statement of net assets and ... fiduciary fund statements, are reported using ... the accrual basis of accounting.  With this measurement focus, all assets and liabilities  associated with the operation of these funds are included on the balance sheet.  Under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are 
recorded when the related liability is incurred.  
 From everything I read, OP and Lighting are right about this year's taxes (and tax cuts) affecting this year's budget.

I understand what you're saying.  Everybody complains....but really, is this post really worth any attention on reddit?
I only made the remark because I couldn't even see a problem until I read through the post.  The phone is still propped up, no?  Ok, so it's maybe 2 or 3 degrees crooked...is that REALLY a problem?!
I think it's a perfectly acceptable standard to hold people to.  It really bothers me that a "problem" such as this, would create enough motivation to making the effort to post about it.
It's probably just me, though.  It pains me to see how dependent and picky most people are on little bits of technology such as this these days, so to see someone complain about their device resting a couple degrees off kilter bothers me further.
  People take their phones way too seriously.
It is simple. Why did you become rich? Because you were great at something and made a benefit of it? Partly, perhaps, but the real reason is that people let you. Would you have become rich in North Korea? Or in Somalia? Or in Soviet Union? Most likely not. The people allowed you to become rich.
We westerners have this weird idea that equality and democracy and freedom are the basic state of humanity, but it is not. Anarchy is. The survival of the fittest and the most brutal. Now, we have seen what happens when a society falls under anarchy: violence. Would you be rich in anarchy? No, you would most likely be dead!
So, to protect ourselves from anarchy, we make a social contract known as society. There are and have been many different kind of contracts, aka societies, with different rules and rights. The major thing in them has been that they have to be supported by the majority of the members, or they will fall and be replaced with new social contract. Sometimes they have used lies to maintain support (power of the nobility comes from god for example), sometimes fear (evil socialist threaten our german reich), but generally the modern western society is based on one ideal: power in the society belongs to the people.
This gets us back to the beginning. Why did you become rich? Because of the social contract that made it possible and allowed it. There is no reason why the majority should support such a contract as it does not benefit them, with the minor exception of believing "maybe I can do that too!", and when they realize that such thoughts are highly unlikely, they will end the contract.
Now, if the rich would pay more taxes with larger percentage, it would benefit everyone in the social contract. It would benefit the rich for still being able to get rich (and not get shot in some revolution that will come with the current system), and it would benefit all other members of the contract aswell as they would get more taxmoney for their benefit. Now you can say "but don't they already benefit with us paying the percentage, as we still pay more in numbers for having larger pays?" Well, if we go with the same percentage, the majority would benefit much more if they would get that money instead of you, because the amount of taxes would be the same regardless of who earns the money. With progressive taxation it is beneficial for them as a whole, as the amount of taxes the society gains are higher in mere numbers, so there is a reason to allow people become wealthier.
Explaining why rich people couldn't have earned their wealth without the consent of the "poor", and to have that consent, they should pay up.
I've worked in muenster for about a year now and yes, you will find much better meat in town than in almost every other place. One thing to note, though, is that Fischer's (304 N. Main Street: 940-759-4211) is both a full service meat processing plant and a supermarket. A little while back they pissed off a bunch of their customers and the other meat plant in town, Muenster Meat Co. (605 N. Mesquite Street: 940-759-2744), started gaining a much larger share of the local market. My Boss started buying from them about the same time and they definitely have more of a personal touch towards their customers. I've only used them once when I needed to have a steer processed, I wasn't disappointed. Some of the guys there have been cutting meat for over 30 years. If you need some special packaging like vacuum sealed steaks or something, let them know. They usually wrap the steaks in a layer of plastic wrap and another of butcher's paper. Works just fine if you're leaving it in the freezer for a few months, but some people might like the ability to look at their meat. They also sell a good variety of sausages (Bratwurst, Knockwurst, Liverwurst, etc...) as well as several kinds of cheese, both smoked and vanilla. 
 One very German town, Two very decent plants. 
I disagree.
It would be fairly easy to create a bot that analyzes the ad and either inputs in what it says to enter (via OCR, looking at the IE9 example on their shitty website), or just create a small hash-library of the ads and their pre-determined responses in a database and have the bot consult that.
The whole problem with CAPTCHAs is that they're really hard to OCR because they're distorted and hard to read, and totally random. Once they become advertisements, making them distorted, hard to read, and unpredictable reduces the advertising value, so ad-CAPTCHAs naturally have to gravitate towards being less useful as a bot-blocker to become more useful as a spamvertisement medium - thus, this is both a bad idea, and not smart at all, if your objective is to block spammers. If your objective is to bludgeon your users with ads, then it's a great idea, but hopefully the gains in ad exposure will be negated from the user annoyance and ease of deploying spam comments. In fact, I think if this catches on I'll just write a bot in C# using an in-memory instance of IE to scrape a page and return the proper CAPTCHA response to post a spam comment - not because I like spammers, but because I want to see this stupid "new, fresh idea" for advertising go down in flames.

I had a credit card with Citibank back in 2000. I would ring it up and pay it down to zero on about a six month cycle. My job made me more money in the summer so I would carry a balance in the winter and pay it off in the summer. It was bad money management, I know, but I was young and hadn't figured out how bad. (Learn the math used to calculate interest and you may never seek a loan again.) 
One day, while I was using the automated phone system to pay my bill as usual, the stupid robot voice says, "Thank you for enrolling in credit protector service blah blah." I immediately start jamming 0 until a rep picks up. I explain to them that I under no circumstances want any credit protection service. They say to hang up and call some other number that handles credit protector. As you can guess, there is no answer. I could not get the program removed from my account, and the charges were equal to the amount I paid for interest each month, effectively doubling my interest rate. A few months later, after much unsuccessful petitioning to get the program removed, I was laid off. I thought the joke is on them now!
Nope, the joke is still on me. 
They refused to activate the service. They insisted that I send them a mountain of paperwork to initiate the claim, and would claim to not receive it when it was sent. After months of arguing, the attorney general was able to coerce them to activate the program. As per the agreement, my account was frozen, and they were to make interest only payments until I started getting paychecks again. This lasted all of 1 month before I received another bill. They had deactivated the program again, but my account was still frozen. They were just no longer making payments. I knew I had to make the payments until I straitened them out, but they would not accept payments because "That account is locked." Funny, I would have been able to pay this if it wasn't for this "Credit protector" nonsense.
That's when the threatening phone calls began, and I once again asked for the services of the attorney general. They suggested it was time to retain an attorney. This shit would not go away, I couldn't afford the lawyers to fix it, and the state provided assistance was not working. The collectors extorted money from my family and I had to pay them back. The money was never applied to my balance, it simply disappeared. I needed to concentrate on studies if I was going to graduate and I began to immediately hang up on their obnoxious calls. That's when every other bank started treating me like a leper. I paid off my car and whatever other debt I had besides federal student loans. 
Fast forward 5 years, Citibank sends me a letter saying they are suing. Not registered, no service of process, just a regular letter. I show up and explain all this nightmare to their attorney and offer a fair settlement. She seems sympathetic and says she will be in touch. I never hear from her again. Fast forward 3 years. Statute of limitations is up, (7 years from last account activity) and I consider the matter closed.
One month later, Some moronic company is trying to collect the invalid debt. I think it's stupid but I offer them a settlement just to make it go away. They refuse settlement, and we go to court. I know that it will be thrown out because of the age of the case. I show up and meet with their attorney. He is being rude and cantankerous, but it's all part of the act. I offer him my settlement, he says no. I say, "This case is ancient history, and the court will not hear it." He says, "I have a judgement." I said, "I want to see it." He waves it in front of me, not letting me read it. I tell him to expect to hear from my attorney and leave.
I hire an attorney. We sign a flat fee agreement and I pay them. The attorney says the judgement is a default judgement from right after the first court date. Apparently these guys had court and didn't invite me. We decide to invalidate the original judgement.
Three weeks later, I get a "capias" in the mail. Basically, "Show up in court on this day or get dragged in." A capias is usually issued when you are due in civil court and fail to show up. I guess they had court without inviting me again. Funny, because I never received any notice of a court date. I even called the clerk every Monday to see if I was on the docket because I expected this by now. My attorney and I go to the court and find their attorney and the constable they hired to enforce this capias. The cantankerous act is gone and they are chatting like old friends. The constable tears up the capias. We go to court a different day and get this default judgement removed. 
Three seconds after we sign this paper invalidating the judgement, both my attorney and theirs are harping on me to sign another one just like it. The judgement is totally unfair and is far in excess of any about I ever owed Citibank. I argue with her for an hour about this, and she says it's part of her long term strategy. Every 3 seconds she apologies to the other attorney. She says to trust her and that it will be ok. She tells me to sign it, and she will handle the rest. I do, and we all leave. I call the attorney's office later that day to ask her to enlighten me on this strategy of hers, and she says that if I want them to continue representing me I have to pay again. I've had it with this mess and I don't know what to do. Any suggestions?
 Credit protector was automatically added to my account, when activated, it only prevented me from making payments leading to financial ruination.
Patents are an absurd game that large tech companies are forced to participate in. Google, Microsoft, and Apple hold countless laughably stupid patents.  If they don't, then they'll be at risk of being attacked by another tech company who *does* hold a bunch of patents.  It's a bit like mutually assured destruction.

 Don't hate the playa, hate the game.
If you really care so much, then work towards reforming the patent system.  Otherwise, don't bother sensationalizing a single stupid patent -- they're a dime a dozen.

I had one. I got it (ordered online from their website) during a time when my girlfriend and I were not able to be together much. I don't cheat on women so seeing other girls was out of the question, but I wanted to have some fun. Long story short, I did not regret the purchase. Since it was a relatively tough decision for me to buy it, I will humor you and give a full disclosure of my experience.
I purchased a real Fleshlight with a vagina shaped orifice and the inside was the "STU" or stamina training unit. As far as how it affected my stamina with real sex goes, I don't think it really made a difference, even when I was actively trying to delay ejaculation. Despite this, I would pick the same type of fleshlight if I were to buy again. The STU has large and relatively flat bumps on the interior, which I thought was the best option. The material is incredibly soft and stretchy, well beyond what you're imagining. I needed a shit load of lube (astroglide) every time I used the thing. Otherwise, it just feels wrong. So make sure you pick up plenty of lube; it won't go to waste.
In a way, it is like superhuman sex. And I am not using hyperbole. I mean exactly what I am saying. It is somehow beyond human sex yet not what you'd experience during real sex. I will explain below.
During a female orgasm, the vagina contracts as you thrust, which feels quite good as the smooth muscular walls of the vagina create semi-firm circular ridges that stroke your penis, and the tighter the vagina, the more you can feel these ridges' stroking action. Experiencing sex during a female orgasm is more or less the best case scenario when it comes to vaginal sex. Moreover, there is the (assumed) physical attraction, weight (i.e. resistive force during thrusting and something to hold on to), as well as someone holding on to you, heat (normal human body temperature), sounds, smells of your partner, probably some adrenaline, a little sweat, and emotional attachment, which all contribute to the pleasure of normal human sex. At least 6 out of 7 days of the week, I would prefer normal human sex.
The STU, on the other hand, is like one of the most awesome and unreal feelings that your penis, (but your penis alone), can experience. Compared to the experiences of normal sex, the fleshlight has no weight to it, meaning you have to stroke it up and down (more on this later). The vagina shape is a decent visual aid, but it is nothing like looking at an attractive woman. Porn could help with that, but I don't exactly have an immersive porn watching setup, just a 22" widescreen monitor. One of the surreal things about it is the heat. You can use it at room temp, but it feels much better if you warm it up in hot tap water. Usually what I would do was start up a porn vid, fill up the sink with hot tap water, also run some hot tap water through the hole, then let the thing float around for about 4-5 min while I watch some porn, lube up the fleshlight liberally with my hand, and then I'd be erect from watching the porn and it would be ready. Usually, I find that a bit too hot is a lot better than too cold. Just be careful.
As far as sounds go, the thing sounds fucking terrible, unless you unscrew the bottom cap entirely in which case it is silent. But then you are likely to drip some lube on the ground. The case is not a perfect design. If you want suction, you can insert your penis with the cap open, then close the cap, and bam: mega suction. The suction lowers the pressure inside the fleshlight, which makes your penis a bit fuller for the duration of the suction.
Smells: there is a faint silicone smell, and then if you don't treat it properly, you will get a little bit of mildew smell as well. I think most people get the mildew smell because they put it away without fully drying it out, because let's face it, most people don't want to see this thing sitting on your dish rack to dry. I *ALWAYS*\ washed it with hand soap (not dish soap) before every use, and I never got any weird fungus or any problems with my penis. It is just a smell, get over it. It goes away if your hand soap smells good.
Now for the masturbation. Since the fleshlight has no weight behind it, you can't grab it like a woman and fuck it up and down on your bed or desk chair. You are limited in the number of positions. It cannot kneel. And so on. It really still seems like masturbation in essence, yet it is somehow more. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It is a good thing because it can do things that your hand and a vagina cannot. For one, it can rotate. You can fuck it at interesting / extreme angles that wouldn't work in a vagina or with a hand. It feels slightly different if you fuck it clit-up or clit-down. And you can do all of this without making your girlfriend very confused as to what you're trying to accomplish. It's a toy, so play with it.
However, there is still the issue of manually stroking. Manually stroking gives you lots of control, and it's a lot less physically demanding than having sex, so you can get nearly perfect control over your performance. But, it still feels like you are just stroking your dick, albeit with something that feels incredibly awesome. You will probably have to lube up a couple of times more if you go at it for as long as I did, but it is nice not having to get lube all over your hands.
I tried many ways to brace it with something so I could stop feeling like I was just stroking my penis and finally feel like I was fucking a vagina. After many attempts, one method worked thousands of times better than anything else. I have a normal height bed/mattress (frame+box spring+mattress), this probably won't work unless you do too. I just braced it between my mattress and my box spring. It was the perfect height for fucking somewhat reminiscent of doggy style. Then, I simply knelt down on a towel and finally I could thrust my pelvis to my heart's content, watching porn and having a blast.
Now, unlike with a woman, you can thrust it as fast, as slow, as hard, or as soft as you want, and you don't have to worry about how anyone feels but yourself. The biggest concern you have is how long you want to last before you ejaculate. And with this thing, you can really tease the everliving fuck out of your penis and practically give yourself blue balls. When you're thrusting, yeah, it feels good. It feels a little too good, I will admit. It is so much more intense than a vagina because of those broad and flat bumps. It is no substitute for the real thing, but it is nice to know that in a way it is actually better than a vagina.
Finally, when you're ready to ejaculate, it is a bit like a thousand angels' fingers stroking your penis rapidly, like you're fucking a vagina that's on overdrive, or if you're using some suction, like 100 blow jobs at once. Your penis will get incredibly sensitive. More sensitive than it has probably ever been in your entire life. And you have to make that critical decision, are you going to keep stroking? It can be a little too intense to keep going. When I am having sex, I do an internal cumshot 99% of the time. And since my girlfriend and I are monogamous, I never use a condom. Yet, a vagina is never going to feel too intense to keep thrusting during your orgasm, even riding bareback.
I hope it's understood what I'm talking about here. I'm sure all you men have experienced this during masturbation... the point at which you are coming and you have to decide whether you're going to focus on massaging the shaft and sort of "squeezing out semen" (i.e. tight fist, ), or if you are going to keep a looser fist and continue stroking the tip of your penis and ride out the intense waves of hypersensitivity, that feeling that in a sense feels so good but it kinda feels bad at the same time. For me, an orgasm is usually a bit more pleasurable with the former, but the orgasm lasts almost 2-3x as long with the latter, concomitant with the production of more semen. With the STU, it's this hyper-intense feeling times 100,000.
I mean let's face it. You will never experience this feeling with a woman, especially not with vaginal sex. Maybe if she is adept at giving the world's most perfect blow job, she kicks the BJ into high gear while you orgasm (gobbling your semen up like it's the Great Depression), and meanwhile manipulates her tongue as if it were as agile as all 10 fingers.
After you experience this for the first time, you won't regret any of the prep or care that goes into owning and using a fleshlight, although if you have roommates it is not going to be too easy to hide. You might as well just let them know you have it so they can quickly get over how funny it is. Just keep it out in the open. Soon enough they will be curious. They will probably end up wanting one, especially if you carry yourself with confidence.
I don't own it anymore, at some point I decided it was getting a bit too beat up from all the washing. (I think the soap is the biggest killer) and if I really wanted another one, I'd just buy it. But lately, my girlfriend has been around a lot and we fuck sufficiently, so I don't really feel like I need another one at this time.
If you are single, there is no reason not to own one. It is one of the greatest experiences your penis can have outside of an actual woman. And for this, the price is negligible. It is the cost of like one or two dates. I would never ever ever go without either a steady girlfriend to fuck or a fleshlight.

Sorry for the long post, I didn't really intend to keep writing this much.

Yeah, you do get some bible-thumper types who'll shun you, but you also get a ton of transplanted Yankees who don't really care what faith (if any) you are.

Girls are like buses, they are designed to carry passengers and have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker buses and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer distance services. Bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same design appearing around the world.
Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes.
Horse drawn buses were used from 1820, followed by steam buses in the 1830 and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first buses powered by internal combustion engines were used 1895[citation needed] and this is still the most common power source. Recently there has been growing interest in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, electric buses as well as ones powered by compressed natural gas or bio-diesel.  Formats include single-decker bus, double-decker bus and articulated bus (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. bi-articulated buses are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers— either towed behind a conventional bus (a bus trailer), or hauled as a trailer by a truck (a trailer bus). Smaller midibus have a lower capacity and open-top bus are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, there is an increasing shift to low-floor buses primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat-belts, toilets, audio-visual entertainment systems and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. Guided buses are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or bus lanes.
Bus manufacturing may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer. Early bus manufacturing grew out of carriage coachbuilding, and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the Leyland National where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses, or modifying standard buses into specialised products.
Integral designs have the advantages that they are have been well tested for strength, stability and so forth, and also are off-the-shelf. But there are, however, two incentives to use the chassis+body model. First it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design— the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second it is likely that over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic) that it will get minor damage now and again, and to be able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its service life and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.[citation needed]
As with the rest of the automotive industry, into the 20th century bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders. Due to the costs involved in owning, operating and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach uses a private hire of vehicles from charter bus companies, either for a day or two, or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers. Charter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator who might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual purpose coach seated buses. Many private taxicab companies also operate larger minibus vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, racing event, or organised recreational activity such as a summer camp. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or conferences. Party buses are used by companies in a similar manner to limousine hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. Sleeper buses are used by bands or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their wedding transport instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for parades or processions. Victory parades are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an open-top bus. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a team bus, for travel to away games, to a competition or to a final event. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, amusement parks, university campuses or private airport transfer services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport. Charter buses may also be used in Tourism and for promotion.
*** Girls are like buses
I could probably meet with the owner again and see about claiming the biergarten for future meet-ups...or I could hand over the pub to someone else to manage(?) I wasn't sure anyone else on r/Austin or Meetup.com would be willing to take on the responsibility of arranging for our group since this particular meet-up takes a bit more planning on the EO's part.
If there's enough interest, I could keep it going. I was actually thinking of getting some numbers for what our group spends on average there and transform it into some discounts for us. I could see "Reddit Only" specials in my mind... :D
Before I do that though, or schedule further gatherings there, I'll try and post a thread (or anyone can just comment here) and see how popular the idea would continue to be. 
- there have been so many new meet-ups added - we have about 460 peeps on Meetup.com now - I wasn't sure if people would still want to hang out at this one).
I have a friend who's worked there a decade now.  He's not happy.  Many people are not.  The product they produce is cool, but it is being produced by a megacorp, so the levels of bureaucracy, stupidity and bean counting are hell.  Sure, being the guys who write Venture Bros is cool, but there's two of them and 500 other people who work on the show and it's just a job.
I got a freelance gig from them a few years ago.  I built a 508 accessible version of one of their websites.  That's a website for the blind.  The thing is, this was a website to teach kids how to read the nutritional labels on food packaging.  They had just laid off a bunch of  people, so no one had the time to build this obviously pointless site.  Still, the higher ups had decided that they needed a version of this site for blind kids, so they paid me a ton of money to build it.  
- just because they make cool shows doesn't mean they are a cool place to work.
The background doesn't really work. The colour is good, but the pattern doesn't compliment anything else. The crumpled paper, grungy textures and collage-like style work really nice together, maybe bring a little bit of that to the background?
As for fonts, do your best to stick to as few as possible. Some covers can even pull off using only one font, most go for two. 
The best magazine covers let the name and the image speak for itself and add only as much text as absolutely necessary. I feel like the text 'premiere issue' here isn't necessary, but instead of just removing replacing it with month/year and issue number might be a good idea (or not needed at all, you decide, it will go on the spine anyway). The tutorial thing isn't right either, at least not where it is. If a slogan or a word adds extra punch to the design, though, use it as a design element.
If there is something good inside, sure, announce it on the cover, but the current text feels like a misplaced headline from inside the magazine.
 Things on the cover in order of importance (must catch the eye first): The name + the image; everything else. Stick to as few fonts as possible.
A new variant of the Influenza, maybe getting called something like "Mayaniac Fever!!!" It will likely kill less people than the common cold.
 A lot of nutter's will kill themselves on December 21 (and I mean like a LOT!). 
A trivial war will break out in either a heavy metal or oil bearing country like Russia or Canada, just because they are bored and need an excuse to ramp up their own economy's to make up for the recessions in America and China. 
 China, parts of Australia, Japan and some parts of South East Africa will suffer catastrophic floods and some earthquakes like we are currently seeing in Japan. 
 A large flare from the sun will knock out large amounts of satellites temporarily. An astronomer will get blinded while watching said occurrence. 
 All in all, it will be a lot like this year, and maybe a bit like 1999.
  
Not much, but a lot... *edit* I still suck at formatting and proper dates.
I strop before and after each shave and while the necessity of it might be arguable, it is the process that has been used for centuries to keep edges keen.  Linen and leather will not *sharpen* as they won't remove steel from the razor; it simply keeps the edge aligned and your bevel straight.  Honing is the process of sharpening by removing steel.
My rule of thumb is that if a shave is uncomfortable *at all* then I do about 50 passes on linen and 100 on leather.  If it continues to be uncomfortable then I go to my highest grit abrasive, which happens to be a strop pasted with chromium oxide, but could otherwise be a 10k+ grit stone.
Once you become proficient at shaving and stropping then your razor will last longer before having to go to the hones.  In lieu of actual whetstones you can look at felt or leather treated with either chromium oxide or diamond paste, both of which are *slightly* abrasive.  Additionally you can find many "barber's hones" which are small high-grit hones that can be held in the palm of your hand to refresh an edge.  These are the hones that most barbers kept at their stations for shaving.
***: strop before/after each shave.  Go to hones when stropping is ineffective at making a shave comfortable.
Please show me where I said "it was casued by the sun" and I will gladly accept the label of "fucking tool". All that I know is that these so -called experts know nothing.
&gt;and the cause has yet to be determined.  
.
&gt;details have yet to be published.

&gt; One theory is that winds have recently swept some areas of Mars clean

&gt;changes in reflectance (albedo) and even volcanic eruptions, so it would not be surprising if several planets and moons turn out to be warming at any one time.
Now for some real science children, please, take a seat.  One example of how the sun effects our weather (without the sun actualy changing irradiance), from 1650 to about 1730 very few sunspots occurred, [see graph](  
This period corresponded to a climatic period called the "Little Ice Age" on our planet. Rivers froze that were normally ice-free [like the thames]( and snow fields remained year-round at lower altitudes.

it's sunspots which cause x and m class flares and these in turn affect climate.
I see your point, but here's the thing. They're 30. She shouldn't be this insecure, not at her age, and not after such a long relationship. 
I get that little details are important, but if OP is working, it's a perfectly valid boundary he has set that she should respect. If he were a hardass, emotionless robot in other aspects of their relationship I'd agree with you, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 
In my experience, girls that require, no, **demand** (via emotional blackmail, as OP's GF) this sort of uninterrupted attention just don't work out in the end (at least for my personality, which seems to be similar to OP's in that regard). Of course I'm not suggesting he should throw away a 1.5 year-long relationship over this, but something has to change, and a serious conversation needs to be had. Expecting to be honeymooning it all the time, possibly forever (apparently quite a few people's dream) is unrealistic and unhealthy. And in my experience, it's also used to disguise other problems in the relationship. 
 Having little details is good; not so much when they're mandatory, and she should be able to respect boundaries like work time.
weed doesn't make people lazy. It makes lazy people okay with being so lazy. I smoked every god damn day until about a month ago. while I was nearly constantly stoned I couldn't really make the push to change my life at all; it was too damn comfortable. Today I still love weed and thanks to how poor I am, I only get high like once a week (if that) and I started going to the gym, getting my shit together for college, even moved out of my mom's house. All that said, I'm still a pretty aloof person, there's nothing I like more than sitting alone at home and reading, but I have to say with the marihuana I'd definitely be doing that a lot more than the important things in my life. 
 Pot is awesome, but it shouldn't come first. Got BILLS motherfucker.
I do believe its a gateway drug, not in the sense that it physically makes you want harder drugs, or that it gets advertised as equally as bad as harder drugs, but because 100% of the people I know, including myself, figured that since weed wasn't so bad, *trying* a harder drug *one time* wouldn't be too bad. Its like a stepping ladder. It doesn't make you a drug addict, most of the harder drugs I've had I've only tried once and the same for *most* of my friends, but we NEVER would have considered them had we not gotten into pot.
 I personally think this whole "pot isn't a gateway drug" propaganda is bullshit.
You forget that most redditors are that way precisely because they can't say what they want all the time in real life.  People are friendlier in person because there's always some small chance the other guy will break your nose.

Nuh-uhhhh
Yeah, most martial arts don't use weapons at all. I wasn't aware of those two you just named so I looked them up. Of course in Ninjuitsu training they are going to teach you how to use weapons. The blanket statement "You guys must not have any martial arts training" has a very abrasive holier than though feel to it.
 Weeaboo
I have quite a few issues with this post. I apoligize in advance for my english.
"it is necessary for the economic system, as the workers are always paid below the value of their labour (so profit can be made)"
This argument only holds if you do not consider the effort of distributing, selling and overseeing this operation as work. Yet all of these things are nessesary if the shoe is to have value at all, for else it stays in the hands of the "worker" as you call him. We have known for many years that having the producer of the shoe also be the seller is ineffiecient, and that increases as the market goes global. In short the person who produces the shoe does not get the full amount it sells for, because the production of shoes at a price that can compete, require investment, distribution and marketing.  
And btw a market is not privatly owned as you describe. A market is just word that describes the interactions between human beings.Two children swapping candy is essentially a market for candy. And it is important to note that both children are happy with such a trade, for else one or two of them would have chosen not to swap. Therefore a market is useful. This also applies to trades in the global economy. Your analogy shows a fundamental misconception.
 A more apt analogy would be that one child started with more candy than the other. This would not change that the two children can engage in mutually beneficial trades. Of course this is mainly relevant if each child owns his own candy. If we were to take both their bags of sweets and distribute them evenly, it would obviously be to the benefit of the poor child. However, knowing that you have give half your candy away influences the incentive to acquire candy. And if you want global equality, well that would require much more than half, since so many children have so very little candy. Hmm im beginning to hate this long analogy, so enough of that.
The cause of recessions is highly debated, and I will not claim to be able to explain them. However I personally believe that a main reason is that our money supply is based on lending from central banks, who in turn demand an interest on these money, essentially an interest on the economy as a whole. Meeting this demand requires risktaking, which creates instabilty. If this is true the solution is a return to the gold standard.
Lastly I want to compliment Mecha-dave, who reminds us that rich and poor are relative terms, and that a look across borders or time shows, that even the poor are rich by many standards.
edit: Markets are not inherently evil
Have you considered auditing? I graduated with a B.A. in Accounting and 3.25 GPA last year and was hired by one of the bigger national CPA firms (not the Big 4, but one of the 10 largest) this past fall. I actually start work in November at $55,000 (Boston area), and have a year to get my my master's and CPA exam out of the way.
I started school as a Corporate Finance &amp; Accounting major, but realized that straight Accounting, and more specifically auditing, was the way to go.  As long as corporations exist, there will always be a demand for auditors - especially if clients continue to lure them away for their own finance/accounting departments after 3-5 years (huge monetary gain).  
Some other perks: 
* Upward mobility is extremely structured (almost guaranteed promotion in 2-3 years and $10,000-$25,000 raise).
* If you don't want to be couped up in a cubicle all day, ~70% of your time is spent at clients' offices with a good chance of international travel in the bigger firms.
* I'd argue there's less stress on profit-making performance, and thus a more enjoyable environment. 
** Auditing pays decently well, will always be in demand, almost necessitates travel, and is like a fast track to CFO. Look into it.**
When I was a kid my dad left his boots outside over night.  As he is putting his boot on he screams, a black widow had gotten into his boot and bitten his big toe.  We lived out in the middle of nowhere and it was probably 30min before we got him to the hospital.  There was talk of amputating his leg from the knee down but the antivenom worked and he made a full recovery.
**tldr** Don't fuck with blackwidows.
So first of all there's the issue with what exactly is sin. Without getting into a denomination war, there's some things that are still debated. Then, not only do we have the specific laws written in the Bible, but then we have Paul saying that what might be sin for one may not be for another. In that particular instance Paul mentions that eating meat might really be a sin for Person X. So for the author to say "is sin what [everyone] really wants?" then the answer for person Y is yes, give me a burger, unless it's going to stumble person X. (e.g. eating it in front of him)
The other thing to keep in mind is that the Bible views sin as a dichotomy. "Let there be not a hint of sexual immorality", "Let your yes be yes", and yet these are two areas that a non-christian would have a wide spectrum of shades of gray. They might have no problem or guilt telling a "white lie" or maybe lusting after some woman. So the argument goes that the Bible has a more strict sense of what is morally detestable. 
So I guess what it boils down to is that the class of actions labeled as sin in Christianity is often times wider than what a non-christian might have, and so thus if they see nothing wrong with doing something, then of course they'll have no problem doing it. Even from a cultural standpoint we see that what one culture might consider a positive gesture is considered obscene in another. 
That's why the power of the gospel is not in insulting the person with listing how many sins you've seen them commit, because we've all sinned anyway and so we're already defaulting to a broken relationship with God. But rather, we can use the gospel to enlighten them of God's power to change their life and free them from the sins that they already admit to. Then once they begin their walk and better understand the Bible, they will come to realize God's view of sin and contrast it with their old view.
 Discussing people's rationality for sin only works if you can properly define what is sin, and a non-christian's view is certainly going to differ, so in their mind, it might feel ok to do something that the Bible would label as sin.
Well it sounds to me like you've already made your decision. Actually, let me clarify a few points before explaining that. First, yes there is a lot of competition for graphic designers, BAD graphic designers. The ones who really know their shit have no problem finding work and rising to the top. Second, you seem to have a well rounded skillset, and knowledge of both frontend and backend gives you a leg up compared to most other designers. 
So in my opinion (if I were to play career counselor for a moment here) you need to focus on being a director. Dont call yourself an art director or creative director, just focus on that role in your own mind for a while, because if you ever called yourself that in public, with your limited experience, you would be considered arrogant and no one would work with you. I wouldn't pigeon yourself into a interaction/usability category. You seem to offer a lot more so that would probably hurt you in the long run. What I would do is, create a very strong website (as minimal as possible, possibly aim for Cargo status) that showcases your design AND UX knowledge using real world client work. That way it blurs the assumption that youre a student fresh out of school. Then tell people you are something of a strategic experience designer. Just make something up that sounds new so people don't have preconceived limited expectations of you. Then say, "I specialize in designing custom experiences for your audience. I can mediate between the front end and back end because I know how to communicate in both worlds (very valuable). I can create and art direct compelling designs from start to finish, both print and online, but what I am most capable of is making sure your customers/users have a seamless experience interacting with your brand." Obviously your version wont sound as cheesy, but my point is, dont limit yourself by picking one or the other. Its rare to be able to play in multiple sandboxes AND be able to translate between them. To me that sounds like a director role.
You need both. They're both part of the same thing.
That's what I do. I kinda organize my browsing on one space, my work shit on another, and maybe photoshop or something on a third. Then I get common stuff like textedit and Trillian to be on all spaces so I can chat and write on all spaces. I just do it to help me keep organized. If space 1 had everything, it'd be hard to switch, but if all I have is like a few browser windows and iTunes, I could switch windows easily, and then move to my work space.
yes
Its hard to explain Seattleites.  My friends/family I have out there are all great people.  Its just hard to break into a new group of friends out there.
I'm not making this up ( we call it the "Seattle Freeze".
The hardest part for people to get about this is the idea of, 'I have friends from Seattle and they're awesome people.. great to get along with, etc." Well, people like them are not like the majority of people in Seattle.  Or different factors influence them to be more socially able to maintain a friendship than otherwise..
Or, they visit Seattle and every person you meet will talk to you on the street, ask them for directions and they'll gladly tell you.  May even ask where you're from and be geniunely interested in what you have to say.  But moving from that casual, "oh you're a person who's not from here" to "You're a person I want to spend more time with" is extremely difficult.
Some people claim it doesn't really exist and people who suck at social interactions make this shit up.  Bullshit.  My brother, a man who literally sweats charisma has people blow him off/no-show with such ridiculous consistency its stupid.
On the other hand, it taught me to commit to things, and if I commit to it, be there.  Because it can seriously hurt relationships if you consistently fuck that up.
 Seattleites will talk to you on the street but will not commit to anything further.  And if they do commit, they have a tendency to no show.
Hey Bryyce, hope some of my experiences can help. I'm 28 and had my colon removed 7 years ago due to Ulcerative Colitis, at that time they gave me an ileostomy and said that they could do an operation to create a ileo-anal/J pouch once my health improved. Kind of like you they left the rectum and let my body heal up. I then had surgery to have the pouch formed (basically part of your small intestine made into a reservoir to store your crap before you get to the toilet) and had the bag taken away.
Anyway I ended up with some complications and infections and had to have to ileostomy bag again. Let heal...tried the pouch again and things were going fine. I moved away from home to go to Uni and then I got sick again. By this point I'd delayed going to Uni 2years because of previous ops so I just let them give me the bag again so I could return to my studies and get on with life. These were the best few years I've had health-wise in the last decade, I had loads of energy and was able to do anything I wanted..played in rock bands, Alpine mountain bike trips..
Once I'd finished the course I returned home to have the bag removed and try the pouch one last time, that was 2 years ago and it's been a nightmare. I've had a recurring fistula (an abscess that has tunneled from my pouch to my buttock which oozes pus and shit) and they now think that I have Crohn's due to the problems I've had not being solved by removing the colon. Am currently awaiting a date to go in for surgery and have the pouch/rectum removed and have a bag for life. 
I am scared like you, although I've had major operations before this one is getting to me because it's the last thing they can do for me and I too have the fear that things may not go as straight forward as they could. What I do know is that this is no way to live (tired, weak, no appetite, constant pain) and that having the bag should help me get my life back on track. Sure, it's not ideal. But by the sounds of it things are far from ideal for you at the minute also. It's great you have a supportive family, girlfriend and friends. They really will be invaluable coming out of a surgery and making you at ease with adapting to life with a bag. Stay positive and be open and honest with the people closest to you. 
Have had a bag off and on over the last 7 years, it's the healthiest i've felt. Any surgeries I had to get rid of bag and look 'normal' ended in pain and ill health. Awaiting surgery to have bag permanently.
oh perfect! I had the same problem for a really long time. 
Basically the only thing that can help you is PRACTICE. the more you do it, the easier it will get, and then you can make it fun for yourself and really enjoy oral. 
I have chronic nausea, which also means a hyperactive gag reflex, which means I always hated giving head because I would feel sick and gag. My current boyfriend has been very helpful easing me into it, and i swear to god, the more you do it and the more you take notice of your partner's reactions and their enjoyment the easier it will get. It honestly only takes time, and dont force it down your throat if you dont feel like it. Some guys are happy to just have their penis licked. 
one common misconception is that you have to deep throat to make it feel good... Not necessarily true, although its nice. I'm sure you know because you do seem intelligent, most of the nerves are at the head of the penis, which means just sucking the head to get used to it is a good start. 
Another thing Ive noticed that has made me enjoy giving blowjobs more is that if I concentrate on how good it feels to have something in my mouth it feels pretty nice, basically develop a sort of oral fixation. Think about how sexy the mouth is! if you can learn to enjoy the feeling of sucking on anything you will learn to enjoy giving blowjobs.
Also the more you do it you'll notice your gag reflex will be put to the wayside. Basically your mouth gets used to having a cock in it lol.
Also one way to get yourself into this mode is to suck on your boyfriend's fingers for  awhile during forplay... first of all, it feels awesome to a lot of people, and you can get used to the oral stimulation and learn to enjoy it, as well as just enjoy acting sexy.
 practice makes perfect, learn to enjoy oral stimulation, your boyfriend will love it no matter what. BELIEVE ME. 
I'll go though the level 5's how XxX vaga Edition XxX to real quick (the x's make me cool):
1: first learn your missions and try to decline the ones that are annoying.
2: fit a cloak to your vaga, what you do is pulse your AB cloak and burn to each tower. This can take a LOOOOOOOOOONG time you might want to get a cup of tea. When you land near enough to it NUKE THAT BITCH. Just keep doing this till they are all down.
3: the  towers will do nothing to the vaga in terms of tank most of the time, you wont be able to run your AB but you should be 100% passive fit. It is nice to be able to run your AB for a bit of a speed tank so kill the neut towers anyway.
Basically you just fit it up with a SPR's and then 1 or 2 LSE's and some res mods. you don't need them but T2 Purgers would help. There are 1000000000 more ships you should be using but if you have to the vaga will work.

 Why the fuck are you using a vaga for level 5's are you retarded ?
Edit:    the new SHC and better IMO ask there in the PVE section "how to level 5's".  Post around a bit first no one likes a lurker.
When I was a kid I wanted to be an architect, but instead I became a software engineer. Clarissa's dad always had really awesome models on Clarissa Explains it All, and eventually I took a CAD class in high school. I thought it was tedious at the time, and eventually applied to the software engineering program at a school I only applied for because I knew I was supposed to go to college and my best friend in high school was going there for that major.
In retrospect, I really enjoyed that CAD class, and I probably would have enjoyed a career as an architect more than I'm enjoying software engineering.
 Short attention span made me give up on my dreams to instead be a sheep
I taught college physics for 6 years to engineering students.  I had some amazingly smart students.  Young minds that could pick up the basic principles I was teaching and apply those concepts to real and abstract problems.  I would say this was about 10% of the students that sat in my class.
I also had engineering students that didn't understand basic trigonometry, much less calculus.  They struggled with physics and after they left my class I doubt they successfully became engineers.  Again, this was probably less than 5% of my students.
The vast majority of engineering students that I taught would pretty much ask one question: "which equation do I use?"  Well, understanding physics isn't about memorizing the equations.  That is why you have an equation sheet on tests.  It IS about understanding the concepts and the process that goes into solving a complex problem.  But they weren't interested in that, just the answer.  
I do believe that engineering makes advances in all fields of science, especially when it comes to bringing basic science discoveries to a workable level.  
  It was a joke.  
The only way I can see this being an issue is if you are easily aggravated and get jealous of people you don't know acquiring completely worthless numbers.    
If someone wants to waste their time refreshing a twitter page to get me the info on here, they can have my karma. Not like it has any value, and making people feel good about themselves has never been easier than an up-vote button.    
- Karma is over-rated, and those that get jealous of those acquiring karma should get a life.
I too absolutely hate karma simply for the reason that it leads to sentences like the one I wish I didn't have to type now--sentences about karma.
Throwaway accounts for anonymity? Absolutely. *Throwaway account so you know I'm not just trying to karma whore / Not trying to karma whore here, but...* is the fucking bane of this site.
It can create a negative/positive perception of people outside of what they actually contribute to a thread just because of that.
... annnnnd causes me to rant, which further wastes time. Oh well, not like we're working anyway.
But anyway, the reason it IS good that people do that is because bringing relatively tiny things to attention of a larger user base in a forum that is far superior in format to commenting elsewhere is a great thing.
*** I dislike it as well. You're not alone. Reddit is still awesome.
I disagree. His defense may be a work in progress, but he's already better as a catcher than Jorge Posada was the last couple of years. 
However, I'm not as high on him as everyone else seems to be, which is why I'm advocating a trade. I also know that Montero was a primary piece that Seattle was SEEKING last year around the trade deadline when the Yankees were trying to trade for Lee.
It's a lopsided trade short term, but Hughes is 23 or 24 and Montero still hasn't gotten his first big league at bat. 
It's a long shot to happen, I'm just reacting to Hughes' crappy start to the season.
Not to play contrarian on you, but My father went through the same thing, and its worked out great for him.
My father was laid off after 30 years 1 year before fully vested pension retirement.  Not knowing what to do he went to work for Home Depot.  They got him on the corporate health care plan and he made $12-15 per hour.  Being on his feet all day he started to lose weight, after 6 months, he had lost almost 40 lbs and found being on his feet easier.  After his strength started to return and he wasn't coming home tired every day, he started studying with H&amp;R block to be a tax professional.  After a year of working at Depot, he had finished his HR block work and transitioned into a career with them.  He now works as an instructor with H&amp;R block training thier new tax professionals, he's in the best shape he's been in for over the last 20 years, and loves what he's doing.   
 My dad is 67, healthy, back in great shape, and is doing better than ever thanks to sucking it up and figuring his $#!t out.
I'm pretty certain you could get away with using just about any combination you want, although I don't think it would be a great idea mixing ATI and Nvidia... I don't know of anyone has ever tried that, so I have no idea how that would work out.  Might be fine, might be catastrophic.
Two 570s would certainly help the power to the non-gaming monitors.  I just don't use my second monitor for much except stats and such while my main is running a game, so using my old card worked fine for me.  If you don't HAVE to spend the cash, no real reason to.  If you're just going to have browser windows open et cetera, there's no reason to put a powerhorse behind that.  If you're going to be doing real work all around, sure, you could (and probably should) use more power.
I hear rumors that it's possible to use SLI/CrossFire technology to use multiple monitors with the newer drivers, so you might be able to equalize usage across the three that way over two cards, but I'm not experienced there.  What I know about SLI/CrossFire is you actually link the cards to reduce the number of monitors and double the power of your GPUs, and that requires matching cards (series/memory) to even work.   And you'd need a bridge, which I think is expensive-ish.
All I had to do was plug in the second card, hook up the monitor, reinstall the drivers, and Windows 7 immediately found 'em both.  Your experience should be much the same...  What do you envision being on the monitors?  I'd choose cards based off that.  The initial card you had linked up there could probably easily run gaming and television (It's got double the ram of my 560, but I don't know ATI products very well.  Newegg lists different values for stream processing, so I can't really compare.  Most of the other numbers jive about the same, though.), if that's where you think you'd need power, then you could save a couple bucks and spare the card the work of the third monitor by popping in something cheap for the third.
 don't spend money you don't have to.  Maximize gaming, but if your other monitors are non-essential, they shouldn't need that much power.
I fucking hate scenes in disaster movies where the heroes run or drive away from forces of nature.
"2012" really overdid this with driving away from the earthquake in a limousine then flying away as the ground behind them just disappears. Then there was something similar in a volcano/lava scene. 
Another worthy mention is "Day After Tomorrow" with running away from both a massive tidal wave and then later cold air.
- Roland Emmerich can suck my scientific nuts.
There is a scene in *Red Planet* where Carrie-Anne Moss is in a spaceship that has lost its on-board artificial gravity. She gets the ship started rotating again, and floating objects instantly fall "down".
That looked wrong to me, so I started pondering exactly when the objects should have fallen. The only answer I could come up with was that they would never fall toward what was supposed to be "down", but instead would be swept forward by the trailing walls catching them.
The reason this bothered me is that *I cannot see any way that the old* Gerard K. O'Neal *rotational space colonies would work.* There is no reason for anything to "stick" to the inner surface of a rotating cylinder (unless it is spread out flat to the surface so that rotation is insufficient to overcome friction). Those nice lakes in the artists' renditions would just slosh over the trailing banks, and people trying to walk would just tumble. Everything would end up floating through the air on a tangent, until striking further along and tumbling again. 
(It can be made to work by angling floors into the direction of rotation, but the architecture will be very different from what we're used to seeing imagined.)
So this was the scene that bothered me the most, because it *ruined* one of my favorite dreams of the future: those big, pretty, open cylinders with forests and lakes.
I know many of you still think this would work. The last time I brought this up one of the comments was that I "fail physics forever".
*But It Will... Not... Work.*
**** This one's a real bummer, you probably shouldn't read it anyway.
Definitely the Highlander (series) episode in which Duncan discovers a mumified Highlander from ancient egypt. He frees her from her sarcophagus for the first time since more than 2000 years and they instantly start chatting in perfect English.
That may be explained by both of them knowing a common ancient language which is translated for the viewer to English. But she goes on talking to normal people as well!
Horrible, just horrible, especially since there is lots of drama and comedy in not speaking the tongue of the time. Wasted plot potential!
Ancient Undead speaks English after 2000 years of sarcophagus
Your right, it usually does nothing. The lightning will pass through the metal aircraft and keep heading towards the ground (or towards clouds, depends on its type) the main problem for aircraft designers is where the lightning first hits will heat up and cause damage to that region. Some arcing within the aircraft between wires and structural components is heard of and may trip a circuit breaker but thats about it.
This is only if the lightning hits the aircraft in the first place, which is pretty rare. The introduction of composites to aircraft adds a couple of more complications but thats a whole new lecture.
 lightning is the least of your worries.
Transformers 2. A bunch of Decepticons go to the bottom of the ocean to resurrect Megatron. They tear one of the Decepticons apart and use his parts to fix Megatron on the ocean floor. 
A naval officer watchs them on sonar, seeing 5 go down and 6 come back up. He even says these numbers out loud.

Just saw the movie HANNA. It was quite enjoyable. But there is an element that annoyed me that happens in MANY action movies. There are multiple scenes where she is effortlessly beating the shit out of large groups of men, and that's perfectly acceptable because she's a BA. But what I don't understand is why the large groups of humans coming at her, have to take turns attacking her.. That definitely wouldn't happen IRL.
 I think it's fucking stupid when there are multiple people attacking one person, and they always take turns!
"Signs" is the worst. Smart aliens with the ability to travel to earth are killed by water and have taken no precautions against water! First, the earth's atmosphere has a high water concentration, even when its not raining, so wouldn't the humidity on earth kill them?  Second, even assuming you need a 100% humidity rate (liquid water) to harm them, wouldn't an alien species be aware that the most common thing on the planet is lethal to them and wear a shield of some type?  Wouldn't they test this before landing!
 Aliens in "Signs" are killed by water, but come to Earth with tons of water and no protection against it
Edit: Maybe M. Night Shamalan movies should be excluded from the stupid movie list
Quick breakdown for you: He used the same bullet size and same bricks, firing multiple shots to find the same break pattern in the brick. Using the bullet he fired in his test chamber to compare bullet break patterns, he reconstructed how the bullet he extracted from the wall at the crime scene was pieced together. He then tested the bullet for fingerprints, and found the thumbprint.
 He was finding the breakage pattern on the bullet from the crime scene so he could put together the fingerprint on the bullet.
The vast majority of my awesome memories during my high school years took place during drama camps. I really enjoyed acting and wasn't half bad at it, but also made some really awesome friendships and always had a blast.
The unfortunate thing was that during the school year, I took drama class (all four years), but was completely ignored/excluded by the drama kids AND drama teachers.
 high school sucked. :(
Ok, so people have touched on this but no one has come right out and said it:  most chick flicks are absurdly unrealistic.  As a female, I feel that I should like chick flicks but really I hate them (with some exceptions) BECAUSE of their blatently ridiculous lack of realism.  Some examples:
1.  Sleepless in Seattle (yes I am even going after the classics!!) - woman hears man on radio.  woman FLIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO WATCH HIM GET OFF A BUS and then flies home.  She then leaves her perfectly nice, albeit boring, fiancee for this random stranger who she has literally never talked to. . . only heard his voice.  WTF?  This is not romantic people, this is straight up stalking.
2.  How to lose a guy in ten days - where to begin.  first of all, the bets that are made are totally retarded.  I get the commentary on evil corporate empires and the media, but really?  would someone REALLY commission a writer to just completely screw with someone?  if you can get past that, you have to get past the fact that Kate Hudson, who dreams of being a respected political journalist, not only accepts this assignment, but she came up with it?  Say goodbye to your career my friend!  Then she goes on to torture someone who AMAZINGLY ENOUGH has a bet to make Kate Hudson fall in love with him!!  Then, after they both find out about their deceits against each other, they miraculously fall in love and live out their lives in a relationship based on trust and honesty... oh wait...
3.  The notebook - now, this really applies to the book more than the movie, but the characters in the book were in love.  for one summer.  when they were 15 years old.  then they had no contact for like 10 years.  so when they reunite, they both admit they are still in love with each other... who buys this crap?!?  someone needs some emotional growth and to stop living in the past.  admittedly, in the movie it was unclear how long they had been together and then apart, and that muddying of the facts made it a bit more palatable.  
Anyway - i could go on forever but i won't.  
unrelated - jurassic park made a big deal about the T-rex's heavy footsteps in the first scene where she makes an appearance, but she somehow sneaks into the building unnoticed at the end?  that always bugged me.
  chick flicks suck balls
The ending scene of "Fight Club" bothers me every time I watch it - how the fuck can Narrator shoot himself point-blank through the side of his face and not induce an injury that would immediately send him into shock, such as:
* Nicking carotid artery or jugular vein, either of which would have led to a bleed-out in a matter of seconds
* Bone fragment incidentally hitting spinal cord, causing instant paralysis/death
After his little brush with mortality, his alter-ego is dead, shot right through the back of the head;  he on the other hand, is lucid enough to re-assure Marla. He then is able to put pressure on his own wound, which somehow isn't mortal. 
**Fight Club is a great movie, but the protagonist should be dead on the floor by the time the Pixies song starts playing** 
Also, while the limo is going full throttle down the highway and gets air, he apparently takes his foot off the gas and slams on the break, because not one wheel is spinning!
If you are going to use CGI, remember physics is a factor... 
I'll need some one else to confirm, but I believe the LOTR was addressed in the books at least (I know the thread is about movies, but if a book offers an answer- why not?). I don't think that the Eagles are fully allied with Gandalf/the Fellowship and a bit of a push/convincing to get involved, much like the Ents. Additionally, the plan to destroy the Ring succeeds because it's subtle. If Sauron had seen Eagles carrying a couple hobbits towards Mt. Doom, he would have been able to mass his forces on or around the mountain and prevented anyone from getting in and destroying the Ring.  
- Eagles were unwilling/unable to get Frodo and Sam to Mt. Doom.
Empire Strikes Back. Luke learns the ways of the force and such in a Karate Kid style relationship with Yoda. If we were to watch that montage alone, we would think that all of that took place over a series of months (since luke was far older than Jedis start and they usually go through many years of apprenticeship before becoming a Jedi master). But the teaching scenes were intercut with the Han Solo plotline where the rest of the characters are lost in space over only a few hours.
 Luke Skywalker became a Jedi master within the span of only an afternoon. And he complained the whole time. 
Any scene involving CPR or a silenced pistol (AKA almost every fucking action movie).
First of all, for CPR to be effective, you have to crack, and then FUCKING SHATTER the sternum. The only place a human will be going after successful CPR is a hospital for 6-8 weeks to recover, and they only have about a %10 chance of surviving the hospital stay after the CPR (I don't have a citation, this is what I was told by an ER doctor at the hospital where I work). 
Second, the LAST thing you'll be doing after CPR is getting back up to beat the shit out of your arch enemy with your bare hands. I feel like this happens WAY too much, but things have gotten better since the 90's.
Concerning silencers: [read the first part of this article](
Share my unholy rage.
 fuck Hollywood
When I was a kid, I was playing tennis on a hot summer day one day and heard a rumbling in the distance.  We looked out and about 200 yards away there was a GIANT wall of rain headed our way.  Now, keep in mind that this is the South in the summertime, and a rainstorm is no joke.  This is the rain where you cant see out your front door it's raining so hard.   We dropped everything and sprinted to the clubhouse which was a good distance away to get some cover.  We made it, untouched, as the wall of rain drenched everything around us just a few seconds later.
 I motherfuckin ran away from a fuckin rain storm and made it unscathed, bitch.
This is my biggest argument with other moviegoers.  Pointing out unrealistic scenes in movies doesn't show that you're clever for catching them, and being bothered by unrealistic scenes shows that you don't know what movies are for.  It's especially unfair if you're bothered by scenes in SCI-FI MOVIES.  *I didn't like The Terminator because time travel doesn't exist.*  Well in The Terminator world, it fucking does.
I didn't like Lord of the Rings because magic isn't even real.
The Village: let's send a blind girl into the woods to get the medicine! She miraculously fights off a "monster" (it was her retarded friend), kills him without discovering he's NOT a monster, makes it to the edge of the woods, gets the medicine (enter Shyamalan cameo--cheesy and tasteless), and, wouldn't you know it, GETS BACK TO THE VILLAGE UNSCATHED.
 In "The Village", blind girl gets out and back in the forest while fighting a fake monster and M. Night Shymalan.
I had a friend who made observations that ruin movies. In the theater he pointed out some of these scenes are photoedited to highlight the salient dramatic points. Like how NASA colors IR photos. He then claims the fireball the protagonist it trying to outrun is, in reality, Hollywood's portrayal of a fart cloud.
friend claimed fireballs in movies are actually fart clouds. NOW I CAN NEVER ENJOY AMERICAN MOVIES EVER AGAIN.
Hopefully the early-90s UNIX had installed gnutils that weren't invented yet. +1 for gumption tho :)

Find wasn't introduced until v7-ish. Unix was made out of crazy, especially the different variants. Linux was freaking awesome because, finally, standardization omg.
IF Linus != helped AND you != way too old AND raptors == 1 THEN self.marinade
She cheated on you.  End it.  Facebook and gym and so forth.
There is never a reason to cheat on an SO, and it is never 'justified' nor is it your fault in any way, shape, or form.  Even retaliatory cheating is unjustified, as if that is the reasoning, the relationship should never have continued in the first place.
Dump this girl and move on.  Lick your wounds and find another.
Grow a set and dump the bitch.
Give her credit for telling you.  The ball is now in your court, but I think deep down you know what to do.  Your 'tl; dr' sums it up. 
The point is that resources are sufficient for the needs of everyone, not to maintain an arbitrary standard of life quality.  Reduction in quality is clearly bad, but it  becomes the question of "is my standard of life worth someone else dying."
Edit/ scarcity is an arbitrarily assigned value.  Does it mean much when you can say things like "yachts are scarce?"
That doesn't make sense.
Let's say there are 20 people and 40 apples and each person only needs one apple. Resources are not scarce.
Now lets say 1 person is hoarding 38 of those apples. Resources are still not scarce but there is unequal distribution.
 Unequal distribution can still be a problem with resources that are not scarce.
i'm sorry, i can't help but reply.  i find people like you ridiculous.  
first off, you said people would want to kill us because they "hate" us.  insightful.
secondly, you said that COEXISTing is a "great idea" but is "missing a hint of reality"
to me there are two types of people:  those who can imagine humans coexisting, and those you can't.  those who can't constantly barrage those who can with "realism," and "common sense," which says that the human family is doomed to indefinitely perpetuate acts of savagery and violence against itself.  war is unavoidable.  violence is man's nature. etc, etc.  then they usually spout out some social darwinian nonsense about surviving in wild, and then usually try to translate all that bullshit to the political and social arenas in order to justify being selfish and violent slags.
the fact of the matter is that modern researchers are constantly learning about the evolutionary attributes which increase the odds of producing surviving offspring, and throwing one's genes into the communal pool.  much of this work has shown the attributes most likely to get you to succeed are the ability to work in groups.  having a sense of community.  understanding social cues, and so on.  the idea that only the most vicious survive is passe.
thirdly, you said "blind to the gratuitous amount of hate and rage possessed by some out there"
this is just standard right wing bloviating bullshit.  the same sort of bullshit you hear from those who would demonize muslims.  people don't hate you enough to try to come kill you because you are free.  hell, they probably tend to admire you for that.  i couldn't get worked up enough out of some perverted sense of jealousy to go kill someone in a far of land.  but if their government had installed a puppet leader in my country, if their military had bombed my home and killed my family and raped my wife, if their corporations had monopolized resources and polluted the land, if their financiers had destroyed the entire world economy...that kind of shit might get me a tad worked up.
people like you help perpetuate a violent world because you insist that human nature or "reality" demands nothing less.
Don't look to TV for pickup advice. TV shows actors. If you want pickup advice learn to be an actor. TV is influenced by the people who produce them, and which are influenced by sponsors and audience. Hince, the push to feminize TV. 
 TV does not match real relationships.
My SO is a well educated professional. She has 2 university degrees, graduating with honours and highest distinction etc... I dropped out of high school in grade 12 and never returned. I make 13/hr and she makes 30/hr. 
I thought for the first several months that she was too good for me... I know she sees me as her partner whom she loves and respects and that my educational or financial background has nothing to do with her feelings towards me. I, however, just feel like at times that she has busted her ass getting where she has gotten and I am riding along on her success. I find myself doing extra things like cooking, laundry, cleaning etc to make up for the financial aspect of things. 
To answer the last part of your question. At first, I had a really hard time with it... I kept thinking very negatively about the whole thing. Until I realized that if I were the one making 70k a year and she was making 20k, I would not care. I would still love her equally and UNCONDITIONALLY.... I never use to let her buy me things. Now I don't even argue or disagree. I simply say thank you and show my affection. 
EDIT: I just re-read this and it seems very jumbled and unfinished. It is 6:37am and Reddit is kicking my ass, so if this AskReddit heats up I will edit with further info if requested.
 It can affect your relationship in a bad way but only if you don't communicate about it first. 
I breezed through highschool and worked hard, finishing my BS in 4 years.  I got a good job in my degree's field.  It was not easy, but I had confidence and just sucked it up.  Perhaps it seemed easy to her.  My then-gf always had family strife, was a C student in HS, took her 5.5 years to get her BS, and still works the dead-end rental car job she worked in college.

This 'burned' her enough for her to dump me.  Since then, I've actually gotten an even better paying, lower stress, fewer hours job.  I find myself in an odd situation though, because I'm once again 'more successful' than the girl I'm dating.

- It can cause stress but reasonable adults can work through it.  
If you want to end tactical voting then why the hell do you want AV?!?!
AV is the system that most entrenches tactical voting, that's a pretty established criticism of it as a system. Here's a thought experiment:
*you are  65 years old. You REALLY hate the Liberal Democrats. How do you make sure that the Lib Dems don't get in in your seat?*
Simple: You see that the Tories are their closest rivals in the seat. You make them number one on your form. Now, you don't really want them, but they aren't as bad as the Lib Dems right? Ok, now second preference. Labour would also give them a run for their money, so you put them second. Again, preferable right? OK, now third choice... urm, getting pretty thin on the ground here. OK, well the party with the fourth most vote last time round was the BNP- well, I don't want them, but if it diminishes the Lib Dem's chances of getting 50%- right, done. And 5th- the greens. Done.
Meanwhile, let's say you *really* want the Lib Dems in. You are exercising a **positive** choice for the MP you want, or perhaps you agree with their manifesto. Now, you can either vote just once, as they are the only MP that you want, and you don't like the other candidates. OR, maybe you think "OK, I don't actually mind the Tory candidate for this seat- he's a progressive Tory as a rule and could exert a positive influence". Now, are you really gonna feel positive about *all* the candidates? Probably not. So your vote is diminished in value compared to the negative tactical voters. So you have a choice- pursue your democratic right to make a **positive** choice for your representative, or also try to figure out the best tactical plan for ensuring the least 'harmful' result to your interests. Nobody benefits. Basically, AV is absolutely classic game theory in action. Try having a ganders at the prisoners dilemma while you're at it.
And furthermore, part of the upshot of this system is the vastly increased likelihood of minority parties being able to exert influence in the UK parliament. If it is the Greens, that's great. But it also means that the English Defence League, The BNP etc. also having an increased role in national politics. That is a not inconsiderable consequence, and one that people really need to think about regarding this change.
Basically, the coalition has offered us the one alternative to FPTP which is arguably less democratic, more likely to lead to tactical voting, and in actual fact *less* representative.
TL:DR- AV doesn't stop tactical voting, it encourages it. Also, I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 colt .45 with a busted safety catch. This is important.
Don't get me wrong, they're good/fun cars to drive.  But their repair bills just scares me.
Also, if you could put 20% down on a house and got a decent job, then you should be able to get a good mortgage rate.  One of my cousin brought a house in TX this year ago and she got ~4%@15yrs for a $110k house while making slightly less than $40k.
Good mortgage rate = 20%+decent job+no defaults/bankruptcy 
Wow, this is a hard spot. The good news is that it sounds like she is going to be OK. 
I would advise that you go and see her - Don't act like she hates you, or be mad at her if you can avoid it. GO and visit like you would if you had heard about the hospital after the fact, and weren't the one who called the ambulance. 
Try to encourage her to start seeing a professional again. The hospital will probably try to help with this (yay) they'll also probably try to get her to start taking medication. 
When I was in the hospital, only my family visited me, as no one else was around. But what stuck out most was how much it helped when they acted as though it was ok. They were worried, but they weren't screaming at me, crying, or asking how I could be so messed up etc. Instead they talked about how much they missed having me at home, how Luke (our dog) was doing, and told me about school etc. 
That hint of normalcy made me feel sane all over again. Well, closer to sanity than I'd been in a long time. 
Act like you usually do. Try to encourage her to get help and see someone, possibly to take medication. If you act normal, it will all work out.
They're just trying to convince you, and by reverse extension, themselves that having kids wasn't a mistake.
 Awww! How cute!
&gt;I have never met this man in person, we've just been talking online, on the phone, and texting for about the past 3 years.
So you want to break up with your boyfriend of 6 years, move 1000 miles away, and move in with a random stranger you feel "close" to because you talk to them online? Either you're incredibly dim-witted, or your relationship is incredibly awful.
&gt; Maybe its just some kind of commitment issue?
Well, yeah, if you've broken up multiple times, I would say that is some indication of a commitment issue. That, or your relationship is incredibly awful.
I'm going to be blunt: if you have gone through this break-up pattern multiple times, chances are your relationship is not that great or does not have a great chance of succeeding. At the same time, I highly doubt you are actually closer to your online lover (let's face it - this is an emotional affair), you probably just feel that way because you have NEVER met him and can thus fantasize about him being extra super perfect. If I am wrong and you do, in fact, feel closer to this guy, don't you think that's weird? Why is that? Is it because this guy is superior to your boyfriend and you two are just meant to be, or could it be that you've been paying more attention to the internet guy, investing more time in that relationship, and thus fostering intimacy necessary for a relationship? And as a result you've neglected your relationship with your boyfriend, thus feeling distant from him?
But what do I know, you should probably just go ahead and move in with this guy and everything will work out perfectly.
Either your relationship sucks or you're making your relationship suck by focusing all your romantic energy on internet guy.
Society is when a group of people work together *with mutual consent* to mutual advantage, not an unchosen obligation to sacrifice yourself to whichever group of thugs claims ownership over the piece of land you happened to be born on, for whatever noble means they propose to spend your money on and which they use to justify their position as your master. Hey I have a question since you don't want me using your electricity, do you actually know how to build an electric generator? How about a microprocessor? How much do you know about advanced cancer research and drug delivery methods? I think society needs me more than I need them. Maybe I will leave this society. Maybe I'll just start a subsistence farm somewhere and claim zero income to the IRS. Maybe I'll just run a roadside diner and laugh at the increasingly desperate panick of the people as the government runs our country into the ground. Thanks for the suggestion.
 I don't owe you or 'society' anything, and if you think you can force my charity, think again.
I'm sure this has already been mentioned, but let's just clear something up; it's a condition of this country that you pay taxes in order to be a legal citizen. So, basically, no matter how unfair you think it is, your choices are pay taxes or leave the country.
And, just to be clear, a country cannot run without taxes. It cannot happen. A government needs taxes to regulate and do everything its citizens want it to.
You know you're paying taxes, so it's not theft.
I'm 18 years old, so many things.
* I had a kid at 16, do people think I'm a bad mum because I'm young?
* Does my body look bad? Will my boobs always be like this?
* Has my metabolism slowed down yet? Will I get fat if I continue this lifestyle?
* How my boyfriend thinks of me.
* How my boyfriend's friends think of me.
* My frustratingly high libido + the decline of sex in my life. It makes me go crazy and doubt everything. Right now I'm so insecure about my body that I can barely handle being naked, even alone, which makes masturbating confusing which makes me extra frustrated.
* My anxiety, and how it's affecting my boyfriend. That makes me uber anxious.
* Not having friends in the new town I live in.
* My armpit hair is really dark and thick. Also my moustache upsets me.
* The fact that I've written this out twice because I wasn't sure whether or not to post. Pro: It let's me vent. Con: I don't want to guilt my boyfriend who will read this, it's ALL me. and because writing all this out makes me want to cry.
 I feel like a crazy person.
In the early 80's, [inflation spiked at around 14%]( Death spirals did not ensue.
Inflation comes and goes, ultimately. Fiat money keeps being printed, and everybody plays along.
Now if you're referring to the depletion of natural resources behind some of those price hikes, you've got something to talk about, as it's unlikely new pools of those resources would suddenly materialize. The impact of depletion would be more permanent in nature, and could only be mitigated by adjusting/re-inventing every process that once relied on it. That may not always be possible. If enough of those processes are lost, fundamental assumptions about our society might become broken. That'd be kinda sorta like a form of collapse.
tl-dr: peak oil! peak helium! peak whatever else we're not thinking about yet!
Lawls, upvote the witty retort. But at least read this:
Hey, I've got an iMac, Macbook Air, iPad, and an iPod Touch.
I don't have a figure, so it may not be a majority, but I would say that a lot of people use different software platforms in their day to day life.
If I have a [software] journal, I want to be able to securely add an entry at any point in my day.
But my day isn't just apple apple apple. At work, I'm on Windows. At school, I'm on Linux. On the bus, I'm on Android.
Personally, I will not use a [software] journal unless I can securely add an entry to it at any point of my day. Despite loving and using apple apple apple, it's not the only goddamn operating system I use.
And yet, they don't have an iPad app, as far as I can tell. Is that the only relevant argument I can make in this subreddit?
Great app, but I would prefer ubiquity for me to actually use it.
Maybe I don't understand you.
&gt;No, it doesn't rely on air movement at all.
I believe your explanation is that since higher altitudes have less air pressure than low altitudes, higher altitudes have a lower temperature due to the difference in pressure. 
What doesn't make sense to me is that the effect of temperature change due to pressure change relies on *changing* pressure. The air on top of the mountain can be any temperature, regardless of its pressure. The only way it's going to get cold is if it is first at a high pressure and then it expands to a low pressure. As soon as it reaches the lower pressure, it stops cooling. Now it is freely able to be heated or cooled by whatever thermodynamic effects happen to act on it. So does that make sense why I said that your theory requires a constant movement of air from high pressure to low pressure?
Adiabatic cooling only happens during a **change** of pressure. 
I use to work at a Tobacco distributor. C store and Gas stations would fax in and order and come pick it up the next day. The orders where normally 200+ so they took a while to fill out. So one day about 5 minutes after we open some guy comes in and wants his order. It hadn't been even pulled off the fax at this point so we tell him to come back in a couple of hours. The guy flips out starts screaming how if he has to wait he wants a discount yelling for the manager. He said he knows he had faxed it the night before and it was our fault. After about 20 minutes of this i see the time stamp on the fax. Walk over to him and the manager fighting and showed that is was faxed in about 10 minutes before we opened. He sent his son to pick them up after that 
Fax time stamp proved customer isn't always right  
I was recently fired from my job in customer service working at a Quiznos in an airport,yes an airport. It was awful "F*CK TSA, D*MN Airliner, Why can't you get my order right?!" I don't even know which story to start with honestly. So here goes a top 3.
1. Normally staffed we run with 4+ people at this time we had 2. One cashier and me making/toasting/wrapping subs. So we're in a little rush and I'm bouncing off the walls getting orders done when a man, hand to god, buffer than Arnold Schwarzenegger comes up to me after getting his sandwich and says "YO BRO, you didn't cut my sandwich! How the hell am i supposed to eat it?!" so I calmly look him in the eyes and say "BRO grab a knife and cut it" and continued on while he gasped in amazement and customers laughed as he walked away.
2. Closing the night shift at "Nathans" (hot dog/snack stand) waiting for the last flight to leave that keeps getting delayed. BTW we can't close until the last flight on that air side boards. So I'm doing my pre-close routine while the cashier helps a customer, but they were talking for a good 10 minutes when my co worker asked me to go get a manager right away. No idea what the situation is I find a manager and tell them there's a customer who needs help, great timing as the manager had the safe open and cashier banks on the floor to be taken to the money room. He says he'll be there in a flash. So I return tell them a manager is on the way and return to my duties. That's when the shit hit the fan "I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER BLAH BLAH MY PLANES ABOUT TO LEAVE, I NEED A MANAGER RIGHT AWAY" So the cashier panics and runs to get a manager leaving the dragon lady to yell at me more while I clean. Finally my manager comes up turns out she wanted to break a $100 and was forced to buy a water and got short changed. Again the rant starts again and she gets refunded the bank breaking 1.29 while glorifying the cashier how she was so great and how I'm a worthless employee and that "She trains employees like me to be worth something" 
3. This is the best of the worst? Anyways, major lunch rush is upon us at quiznos when i notice that the cashier has been taking one lady's order for about 15 minutes. Once the ticket printed out what we saw made no sense and had to ask the cashier wtf she wanted on it. As I'm standing on the wrapping side I hand out subs to customers, so the lady comes up and says "OH DON'T TOAST THE 2ND SUB" I caught it in time and had the sub maker not toast it. Then another request "OH MAKE SURE TO PUT CHIPOLTE DRESSING ON THAT" On which one mam? "YOU DON'T KNOW OMG THE ONE WITH NO TOMATO I SAW TOMATOES I SAID NO TOMATO" Mam this is not your sub "oh ok make sure you cut all 3 subs in half" yes mam, finally they get to my side and i cut them in half "WAIT I SAID I WANTED THOSE CUT INTO THIRDS! WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?!" mam you said in half but i can try to make it thirds "WHATEVER JUST GIVE ME MY SUBS" she returns 5 minutes later throwing all three on the counter "THESE ARE ALL WRONG MAKE THEM AGAIN" by this time I've had it and write down everything she says and go make them myself "NOW I WANT THOSE CUT IN QUARTERS" I say ok, making sure they were made how she wanted, handing them off thinking thank god I don't have to deal with her anymore. WRONG She's back again and something isn't right. My manager rescues me and I go to the other side making sure her sandwich is perfect (not including the snot/spit/mucus I added for seasoning from the flu I currently had) Finally it's to her satisfaction and storms off raging about poor service and terrible food. Keep in mind we were still in a rush and she back us up so much I thought people behind her were going to kill her before I had the chance. Ahh feels good to vent this. :)

 People suck and don't f*ck with people making your food.
This is one that my friend did at a major restaurant franchise:
A man comes up to the register and orders a TON of food.  The french fries were coming straight from the fryer, but there were still two minutes until they were finished.  My friend told the man, "Here's your food, but your french fries still have a couple of minutes until they're done."  Well, the guy goes off the wall, bitching about how the service sucks, and how he's in a major hurry and what bullshit this all is.  My friend THEN says (tersely), "Well, now there's only about 45 seconds left, and I will have them out fresh to you."  Well the guy blows another gasket and says "Hey, asshole, let me speak to your manager!!!!1!"
At this point my friend has had enough.  He backs away from the counter, turns his back toward the customer and pauses for 5 seconds, then immediately turns back toward the customer with a huge, fake smile plastered on his face and he says "I'm the manager.  What can I do for you today sir? :DDDD"
 My friend turned out to be the manager the asshole customer asked for.
The company I worked for owned a bunch of franchises.  They treated everyone like garbage and paid them nothing.  Raises could be up to 25 cents every six months but management did everything they could to keep you from getting more then 5.  Meanwhile our store ran the best profit margins in the company because we were good and fast.  I usually cooked, but the nights I ran the drive through window it was great.  I made almost every customer laugh somehow, and I didn't do it in a douchey way.  I was just friendly. Sometimes its just nice to see someone else smile during a shitty shift.
 When work sucks and everyones pissed off, it's nice to see someone smile over something. 
Because the fuck a little doesn't hurt anyone.
I was working in food service at a cash register. A customer came up and placed an order, I rang it up, she wasn't happy with how much it cost. 
She started whining and being a real bitch. My coworker came up and stood next to me, looked over what I did, and just kinda stood there polishing a counter. She squawked "Get me your manager!" 
I say "ok sure, but ma'am this is the correct price." 
Coworker standing next to me is actually the manager. He looks at the woman and goes "yup" and continues polishing the counter.
"buh... wha... uh... ok fine!" shouts the woman and walks away. 
The two of us crack up laughing
**undercover boss pwns unruly customer**
I was pretty tight with the QA person and my supervisor when I worked customer service, so being me, they probably wouldn't care. A lot of that stemmed from the fact that immediately before that job I had been in the military for several years, and had a special knack for absorbing incredible amounts of verbal abuse without changing my tone or losing my composure. I've found that angry people tend to get MUCH more angry when they realize that you're not reacting. So 1-2 times a week there would be a customer complaint about me that would end with my supervisor/QA listening to the tape with the customer on the phone and saying 
&gt;"Ma'am, all I hear is you yelling at my employee and him staying perfectly calm. I will admit he is somewhat impersonal, and I'll discuss that with him on his next review, but there is nothing here that sounds at all rude or insulting from him."
In the end, they didn't like me because I had a habit of taking calls like "Name? Phone Number? Is this your address? Your internet is down? Hold on. Hold on. Are the lights blinking now? Ok, is the green one steady? Try going online now. Good? Would you like to order HBO? No? Thank you for calling, have a good day" which skips most of the scripted niceties that you're supposed to say...but the flip side was my average call was only ~180 seconds when most people have a ~400 second average. So they couldn't argue with my numbers. 
 They probably would have said "Damn it Des, you technically hit every point on the QA checklist, but would it kill you to sound like you're actually sorry?"
I worked at a drug store in high school. I had a German couple check out at my register, and they were incredibly rude. They we're bitching in German about the customers behind them in line, using vulgar language and what not. Apparently, I wasn't moving fast enough for their liking, and the woman called me a "fucking bitch" in German, obviously not aware that that was the terribly impractical language that I took in high school. When I finished their order, I stared her in the eye and said thank you in her native tongue, and they both looked shocked and embarrassed. It felt good, man.

 The only time I ever used my German language education was to tell off some rude customers. Woot woot.
I used to work in a chain pizzeria known for inexpensive, ready-made pizzas.  On the counter, we had small condiment packets containing red pepper flakes or "Italian seasoning."  There was this character (of Indian descent, I believe), roughly middle-aged who would request that we prepare him a pineapple and cheese pizza (not particularly cumbersome) but asked that we would put red pepper flakes under the cheese, on top of the sauce (a little unusual, but since the pizza was a custom order anyways, no big deal).  Unfortunately, this guy seemed to piss off every single counter help person by either bitching about his pizza (not enough toppings/cheese, not cooked the proper amount of time) or about the credit card fee our company had imposed if the order was under $10, an extra $.35 added to your order to accomodate the processing cost.  He came in every Friday, a particularly hectic workday where tempers run high and fuses short.  He would arrive with his wife.  Now, I'm not sure why this always stuck out, but his wife never spoke and she always rode in the backseat.  He didn't speak to her while they waited... she just sat there in her shawl and looked straight ahead.
At any rate, one week we were out of red pepper flake packets.  My manager, a bit of a malicious prankster, knowing that our favorite customer would be coming in that afternoon, ordered one of the crew members to the grocery store to purchase habanero peppers as a substitute for red pepper.  The manager cut the peppers up very fine and placed them under between the sauce and cheese.  The man left got his pizza and left without incident...  he returned a short while later with the pizza box.  He dropped it on the counter and said, and this was quoted for as long as I worked there, "the pizza... it is too spicy!"

Epilogue:  He wanted a refund.  He got it (after the manager explained that what we were doing was not typical and we were being very accomodating).  He continued to come in, being a pain in the ass.  It did not shut him up, but it was amusing.
  Indian guy is a pain in the ass, gets a pizza he deems "too spicy."  Hilarious portrayal of his accent follows for years to come.
Not exactly the same thing, but kind of similar:
When I was 21, I was in the Army, in Iraq. Having just been promoted to Sergeant, it was decided for some unoodly reason that I was going to be in charge of logistic combat patrols around Tikrit. Basically, I provided the security force for patrols that moved people and supplies around the area. Granted, I had just turned 21, and looked like I was 12, but I was an NCO (non-commissioned officer) and took my job very seriously. Every day I'd get the people I was providing security for in formation and go over the rules of engagement, our plans for various scenarios, and my rules of the road, which included NO FUCKING INTERACTING WITH THE IPs (indigenous peoples). Don't wave to the kids, don't give water to the beggars, don't do anything. We don't want kids on the road because they pose a risk of being hit by a vehicle accidentally and we don't need angry parents, and we don't want adults near the road (unless they do business there) because in the event of an attack, we don't want collateral losses (from enemy fire, not our own. My policy was generally not to shoot back).
So one day, I'm taking some people to another post, and I see someone throwing lollipops out of the vehicle to the kids. Sure as shit, before you know it, there is a trail of kids following my patrol and rushing the vehicles. I get on the radio and as I don't know the callsign of the driver I just broadcast to the whole net "No fucking interacting with the IPs". It doesn't stop, more lollipops are thrown, and I slowly build to rage level. 
So we get inside the post, and I go to the vehicle throwing the lollipops and I see it's some national guard chaplain and his assistant. I said, relatively calmly "Sir, was that you throwing lollipops out of the vehicle? You can't do that on a combat patrol". His response was essentially "Yeah, that was me, who the hell are you kid?" (which infuriated me as if he doesn't know who I am, that means he wasn't paying attention to my mission briefing). I lifted my goggles which were attached to my helmet to show my rank and replied "I'm Sgt DesCo, your patrol leader. You're going to have to find another ride home". Did a quick about face, radioed the gate that we'd have one less vehicle departing when we left. 
I got a pretty stern talking to about leaving a man behind when I got back on post (mostly for show, as I was in every way correct), but it was worth it knowing that that chaplain had to stand at the rally point for the rest of the day, waiting for another convoy going to our post willing to pick up a an extra vehicle of non-combatants. 
Wow...that was a longer story than I planned. ***: Felt dismissed due to my age by someone much higher ranking than me in the military, and consequently refused to allow him to ride in my convoy, leaving him stranded on another post. 
I work in a Apple store (don't hate Reddit) and as I'm sure everyone knows iPad 2s are pretty impossible to get at the moment. Now the one I work at is located in an affluent part of town and the customers that shop there tend to pretty impossible.
So yesterday I'm stationed near the from of the door and I see this guy storming up and I prepare myself for a berating. Sure enough this guy is holybatman PISSED. He made sure to loudly inform me that he is from California and that his time is very valuable. He get out his iPad 2 and is waving it around my face. When I finally understand what he is saying I realize that he is pissed because he wanted the 3G model and got the Wifi model. He ordered it online and probably didn't realize that there were two different models and just ordered the wrong one. Usually this wouldn't be a problem and we would just exchange it for the one he wanted.
Two problems with this:
1) he didn't have the box/charger/receipt/anything it came with (which means he could have gotten it from anywhere) 
2) we didn't have the model he wanted
After I explained this to him he started a grade A two year old tantrum. Which I'm used to, but then he started personally attacking me and my gender (girl).
Finally I had to stop him and was like "Look Mr. Herpderp, I would love to exchange this for you, I really would, it would make my life easier. But I can't create iPad 2s, and I can honestly tell you we don't have the one you want." Once he finally realized that I was not depriving him iPad just to be mean he stormed out. 
 iPads are necessary to live apparently. 
edit: grammar 
I worked as a lube tech and then assistant manager at a JiffyLube franchise after college, while I waited for my husband to graduate. We were a three bay store, but often only worked on one or two cars at any one time. 
One day this guy comes in with his late model sedan for an oil change. I've only got two bays running, but my crew drains it as soon as it comes in because oil drains better while the engine is hot. Then everyone keeps working on the cars in the other bays which are ahead of this guy in the queue. 
Ten minutes later, just as we're ready to start on his car, he storms out yelling about how he's waited too long and wants to leave RIGHT NOW! I calmly explain that there's no oil in his car at the moment and he could destroy his engine, but if he'll wait another moment we can have him out the door, but he just rants about how he's not giving us a single dime and doesn't want us touching his car anymore. 
I print out a service receipt with the words “Costumer left before service was finished. NO OIL IN ENGINE ON DEPARTURE” in the special comments section. Which he willing signed for me, and we let his fool ass roll the fuck out with his engine making a not-so-great noise. 
Sure plenty of my JiffyLube stories are ugly on the service side, but we had some pretty batshit customers too. 
Impatient jerk drove off from my Jiffy Lube with no oil in his car, even though I warned him about it

During high school I worked at a burger king. I've probably told a couple stories about it before, but I don't think I've done this one yet...
There was this one woman who would always come into drivethru during the afternoon and ask for a whopper jr. with extra onions. And I mean, a LOT of extra onions. And no matter how many we put in, she always came into the store and bitched that there weren't enough. Still, this was in the middle of the afternoon, so we didn't care. 
However, one day, we had four buses full of US Army enlistees at the store at the same time. (convoys of chartered buses would go by periodically, and they usually stopped at our store because the bus drivers knew my boss)
Now, these people were always the nicest, most respectful people you can possibly imagine, which was a welcome change after dealing with assholes the whole day. They also always ordered a crapton of food (all king size, tons of double and triple whoppers, the whole nine yards.) My boss would always have me give them the "senior discount" (15% off), and they enjoyed that immensely, because it said that they were getting a senior discount on their receipts.
Anyways, nice as the were, they strained our store to the limit because they ordered so much food. So we were almost literally going hammer and tongs to keep up, and then bitch-face woman comes into drivethru. My boss told me to just grab two handfuls of onions and put them on the sandwich, because she didn't need a scene when we were as far behind as we were. I could barely close the fucker because of the onions, but I managed it and we gave it to her.
Now remember, the store is completely full of US Army enlistees. They probably have not had fast food for weeks (I think they were going from boot camp to get their first assignments). And the line was out the door. So BFW pushes her way past all of these people, rudely shoving them out of her way, and comes up to the counter screaming that she didn't have enough onions. My boss is pissed, so she takes the sandwich, hands it to me, and tells me to do whatever the hell I want with it.
I dumped the ENTIRE FUCKING TUB of onions on this (probably about 1.5 LITERS of onions), and wrapped it up really, REALLY tight, and taped it shut (Note that the wrappers were somewhat elastic...). My boss hands it to BFW, and she opens it right on the counter to "make sure we have enough" (Even though it's like 6 times bigger than normal &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)
The thing fucking ASPLODED ALL OVER. SO freaking awesome. All the troops were trying not to laugh. One of their officers (a ~~pretty~~ **quite** young 1st Lt.) was waiting by the counter for his food, and finally he just gave up and started laughing his ass off. The troops took this as a cue, and she had about 250 troops all dying laughing at her. One of the best days of my highschool life. 
She didn't come back for a month, and she never, EVER complained about not having enough onions.
**** Asshole woman complains about having too few onions, I rig her modified sandwich to asplode in her face (onion geysers ftw), she gets laughed at by 200+ soldiers.
EDIT: clarification, see strikethrough
I was working as a cashier in the garden area at a home improvement store. I was the only cashier on staff and since it was the beginning of spring, we had tons of people buying flowers, mulch, paving stores, etc.
My line of customers went further back than I could see, I would say at least 30+ people waiting to check out. Now, having worked as a cashier at a very busy store and trying to get people out as fast as possible, my least favorite form of payment quickly became checks. They take the longest by far to use. From them it filling out, me checking that every was okay/legible, and waiting for it to clear the system, it really slowed down lines. Not to mention that those who usually used checks were already not in a rush to begin with.
**Begins**
So, with people getting visibly upset with how long the checkout line is, this lady with her ~8 year old son wait for me to finish ringing out their 3 flowers. After dutifully making sure each of the items rang up at the correct price, she pulls our her checkbook and before she begins to fill it out, she turns and says to her kid "Why Jimmy, you should watch me write this check so that you'll know how to do it when you get older." To which I reply without hesitation "Hopefully by then, there won't be any checks." She glares at me while I give her a wide-eyed, head-tilted-sarcastically, I-don't-give-one-fuck look.
Jimmy didn't learn how to write a check on my watch.


I tried to return a new phone I bought in Philadelphia to a Verizon store in Seattle. Verizon had just bought a bunch of smaller cellular companies, and was still in the process of integrating their east coast and west coast warehouses. They couldn't perform ANY service on my phone because they did not have any way to access my account created. I decided to terminate my service, and return the new phone. This was a problem because the time it would take to ship across the country would put me over the 15 day return period. I called to make sure this was OK, and was assured that it would be.
At first they didn't refund me for the phone. I called them to see what was wrong, and was told that to get the full refund, I would have to pay a substantial fee for the late return and cancellation. I told them that I was assured that there would BE no fee because of the warehouse situation. The Service rep saw the note on the account, and said there was nothing they could do about it now that I had already been charged the fee, however he would set up an account credit, that once I paid the fee, would put me even, and I would essentially get the full return. Basically, pay the 100 bucks, get 300 bucks, and you'll be even for the 200 dollar phone. OK, fine. I am SO glad I decided to terminate my service now.
I cut verizon the check and send it. Along with a note with all my account information and an explanation of what's going on, how to reach me, etcetera. 
A couple months later, still no word on the refund (at this point I have stopped expecting it), but I am now getting calls and emails from verizon about an unpaid bill. Apparently they DIDN'T cancel my service, and have been charging me the whole time. I tell them to check my records, the phone hasn't even been turned on for months BECAUSE IT IS IN THEIR WAREHOUSE, and that service should have been canceled months ago. The account number was both written on the check that I wrote, which my bank records show that they cashed, and the note that went with it. Verizon said they would get back to me. They never did.
TWO YEARS LATER! A collections company sends me a bill on behalf of verizon. They say "You owe $XXX, but for a limited time, you can pay half of that, and this will all go away." I am now pissed off. I call the collections agency and tell them that I have already paid verizon, and that they in fact still owe ME 200 bucks for a phone return (I'll bet they get that a lot.) The guy at the agency says "prove it," so I sent him a copy of the check that verizon cashed for the exact amount he was trying to collect. He said he'd get back to me. Still waiting for that one to crop up again.
 Verizon cashed a check i wrote them, told me they never got it, then sent a collection agency after me 2 years later. I faxed them a picture of the cashed check from my bank records.
The bitch of it is that if I had switched banks in that two years, I would never have been able to prove that I already paid. Print out everything for your own records folks.
to be fair, for all the old lady knew you could have over charged $0.90 by not getting it checked. 90 cents when living on a strict budget is an unnaceptable loss.
tl,dr: im poor
I'd agree with that. 
You would not believe the assholes that come into the frozen yogurt store I work at. The people who are nice/some of the midshipmen in uniforms pretty much get their stuff free because they are so far and few between.
Actually, this Easter when I was working I gave a man wearing a reddit shirt his smoothie free. I called it "the reddit discount'
I have about 4000 stories about customers too, you would not believe.
 I'm one of the many reasons you should be nice to workers selling you shit. 
NEVER APOLOGIZE TO CUSTOMERS.  This fuels their flames of self-righteousness and makes you look weak, so they attack more vigorously.
I do live product demos/infomercials in stores.  I make an announcement over the PA system that says we are "handing out free gifts to introduce new merchandise into the store" yadda yadda.  Basically, I lure people to my counter, give them a neat little free thing, then while I have them trapped, demo a product.  I'm fantastic at this, so they always buy.  However, it inevitably happens that someone thinks they're smart and tries to extort a free set out of me by claiming I told everyone the demo product was free.  Then they make a scene, everyone gets spooked or turns on me, and I make no money and have to go be furious for a half hour.  You learn ways to deal with this REALLY quick.  My favorite instance:
I'm in a Bjs (if you don't have those, think Costco's or Sam's Club.  Big box bulk store) with a group of about 40 people in front of me.  If I sell to everyone, I'll make about $300 for 20 minutes of work, so I've got my A-game going.  They're laughing, they're answering my questions.  Everyone is REALLY enjoying the product, and they're all totally going to buy.  I finish the presentation, and get to the price.  I say "...factory direct price of $29.99" and a guy in the DEAD CENTER of my audience yells out, "Wait, you said that was free!"  
The first time this ever happened to me, I apologized and said I should have been more clear.  The rest of the audience got on his side, and they all left me standing there like a shmuck.
This time though, I rolled my eyes like he was the dumbest person on Earth and said, "I said we would be 'handing out FREE GIFTS to INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS into the store' sir.  I understand that SOME PEOPLE might have trouble understanding that, but I think everyone here is on the same page."  Then I looked around at everyone, nodding my head, and they all nodded back.  A group of ladies laughed really loudly and said, "Can you believe the nerve of some people?"  He slunk away in shame, and I made $300 for 20 minutes of work.

*** I do product demos. People try to ruin my show, and I turn crowds against them.
I used to work in a store called Magnum Mac, which is a store that sells apple products (iphones, imacs and whatnot) in New Zealand.
A well known customer rings up, furious because apple hasn't emailed him to inform him that the iphone4 is coming out tomorrow. He keeps compaining to me about how "you guys should've told me, I registered TWICE on the apple website." 
I politely tell him that we have nothing to do with the Apple itself, and we just resell their products. He continues to abuse me/MagnumMac saying how we don't treat our customers well. I cut him off mid rant, and said "Look, you wouldnt go into the BP across the road and complain to the cashier about the oil spill (that was happening at the time), your iphone issue has nothing to do with us, and we cant do anything. 
I got silence, followed by a "I can't believe this" chortle, then he demanded to speak to my manager." Then i got in trouble. 
Anywho, fast forward a few days, every time he came into the shop after that, I always helped him, and was as useless as humanely possible. I would go "out the back" to find stock for him and take 20 minute lunch break, then come back out and claim that I couldnt find what he wanted.
- douche was a douche to me, I made an awesome metaphor, he shat bricks and got angry.
I've done some customer service jobs before. I find that if you're polite and ask the people how they're doing, start a conversation with them and joke a bit, they feel better, and maybe sometimes something just won't ring up on the scanner, or you find some extra fries with your order.
Be polite to customer service people. They appreciate it.
No one will probably see this, but I don't really want to let this thread go without throwing this out there.
I used to work in retail for a carrier, and they had those payment machines. This huge man comes in, wearing very tight clothing and demands we help him on the payment machine. We point him in the right direction and encourage him to try it himself first since we're super busy, if not we'll help him in a second.
He sort of waddles over to the machine and looks at it for a few minutes, starts dropping all kinds of F-Bombs on the salesfloor and walks over to one of our reps who just finished up. He's literally spewing forth copious amounts of spit as he screams at our rep.
Cust: What the fuck is wrong with this machine! I've been trying to make that fucking machine work for almost half an hour (more like five minutes).
Rep: I'm really sorr...
Cust: I don't give a damn about your sorry, help me use this fucking machine.
You can see my coworker was intrigued, so they walk over to the machine together. The guy starts yelling again and they have the following conversation:
Cust: Just take my fucking money! Help me use this machine.
Rep: Sir, I realize you've had a lot of problems with this machine. That's in the past... ***MOVING FORWARD***, we're gonna use this machine here, let's start. (The obnoxious, and deliberate tone which he used for moving forward seemed to perturb the customer just a bit).
The guy is just screaming, threats, etc. and finally, my coworker gets him to stop talking and they start to use the machine.
Rep: Ok, so I'm gonna click the "Pay-By-Phone Number" Option. So right here it's asking us for your phone number, ***if you could read*** you would type in your phone number. So, since you can't, what's your phone number, I'll type it in for you.
All hell is raging behind the silent eyes of this large man as he practically whispers his digits. Next screen pops up.
Rep: Alright, so right here it says, "Please type in the last four of your social security number". 
(turns to the guy, looks him dead in the eye and says)
Rep: So, ***if you could read***, you would type the last four of you social in.
***BOOM***, he blew his lid, starts screaming, starts to dial the cops, just ballistic. He runs over to me, thinking I'm the manager and demands I fire the rep. We talk for a while and it finally devolves to this:
Me: But he was only trying to help you pay your bill.
Cust: He called me illiterate! Do I look illiterate to you? Do I look like I cannot pay my bill?
Me: Well, if you could read...
 Illiteracy in America is reaching epic proportions.
This immediately brought a particular story to mind.
I work in clinical research; we test out drugs before they're put to market on human subjects. Part of my job is to screen out the potential subjects from any joe schmoe that decides to call us. Part of my screening process involves a very simple health questionnaire.
So one day I'm returning phone calls from our voicemail and I come across a phone number that's already in our database. This guy has previously screen-failed because he has a penicillin allergy. I decided to call him back to tell him that, unfortunately, we spoke to him on a previous date and that he failed before. He insisted that "someone stole his phone and he really, really wanted to participate". I asked him for his full name, phone number, and date of birth. All matched the previous information. I told him that he had definitely called us before and I had documentation about the previous call.
Cue all shit breaking loose. This guy was PISSED. He was getting really worked up and was threatening to call my manager. Fine, I say, I'll go through the whole process on the phone with you. He's all for that. So I reread him the script about the study and go through the questionnaire. I took my sweet time because, well, if he was insisting on wasting my time I was going to waste a bit of his. We get to the last and final question regarding penicillin. He hesitates, then says "Well... no, no allergies". I shoot back "Sir, it sounded like you hesitated. It's really important that we know if you have any sorts of allergies, because we've had previous subjects suspect that they had allergies, and they had some serious complications." He hesitates a little, then says that he does, indeed, have a 'mild' allergy. 
I replied with "I know you do, sir; that's what you told me the FIRST time we spoke. And now that I know for certain that you're lying to us, I'm referring your name, DOB and phone number to all of our subdivisions, so you won't be participating in any of our research. You're an unreliable subject." I hung up as the second round of yelling started. It didn't necessarily shut him up, but he hasn't called back.
Clinical research gets a lot of repeat callers looking for a quick buck. It's my job to make sure they don't get in once they fail screening. Potential subjects aren't always happy.
My brother and I manage a chain of dry cleaners.
Once a lady picked up a pair of her husbands pants, and left. A few minutes later, she called and said the pants that she received did not belong to her husband, and we had given her a pair of "cheap pants," and he only wears "expensive pants." I asked her for a tag number that was on the pair of pants, looked it up in our computer system, and they matched(sometimes our system lies, but it is a rare occurrence). I told her the numbers matched, but she should bring them back for me to take a look at. She told me she did not have time to return them, but that she would be coming back in a few days to have us buy her a new pair of "expensive pants." I foolishly gave her my cell phone number, in an attempt to diffuse the situation, and told her to stop back when she had a chance, and her husband could call me if he had any questions. Over the next two days, I received three or four hysterical/crying/rage filled phone calls from her and her husband, lamenting our service, threatening to get lawyers involved, and saying our cleaners was a poor representative of the community.
Eventually the husband returned the pants to our store, fuming, and proceeded to yell at my brother for our "poorly-operated-joke-of-a-business". Side note: we place a bar code inside all pants "for pricing accuracy" (Read: to protect us from douche-bags like this guy). My brother scanned the faded bar code and was able to determine that the pair of pants had been brought to that specific store by that specific customer 19 times over the last 3 years. The customer just said "Huh," grabbed his pants, and walked out. We haven't seen him since. 
- Read the rest of this thread if you are in customer service, it gives you just a tiny bit of hope for the future. 
I worked in retail at customer service just after high school.  A customer brought in an MP3 player he had CLEARLY cracked the screen on; yelling and screaming for a replacement.  He was throwing the standard "Better Business Buearu, never shopping here again, blah blah blah" tantrum.  The poor customer service rep (tiny 18yr old kid) tried her best to show him the Manufacture Warranty coverage and handed him the pamphlet.  Not giving up his tantrum the next customer in line said "hey man; shes just doing her job and you clearly broke the screen, which isn't their fault"  The guy TURNS AROUND and faces the customer who spoke up; slaps him with the brochure the rep handed him, and yells at him "MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS!"  At that point the greatest single event I've ever been witness to occured.  The 2nd customer who got slapped takes the first TO THE GROUND AND HANDCUFFS HIM!  He then states "Sorry pal; you just assaulted an officer; I'm taking you in."
Turns out he was a plain-clothed detective; and was on-duty at the time.  The first customer just didn't see the gun and badge on his belt :D ha!
**Angry customer slaps the next customer in line who tried to stand up for customer service worker and gets arrested by said customer**
Ugh yeah I once worked at a grocery store in Ontario, and *most* grocery stores there have you pay for your plastic bags, and let you bag them yourself so you bag it how you want it and don't bitch about how it was bagged/speed up the process instead of them staring at you uselessly. 
If they want us to bag it or a bag guy isn't busy we will help bag. The cashiers aren't allowed to put bags in the carts because they would have to leave the register and walk around, the way it is set up.
So this lady comes up and I'm scanning her items and pushing them down the little metal ramp thing towards the bags (gently, I hate when cashiers smush my bread by shoving the cans down). I say hello and smile and ask her how her day is going. She says nothing and avoids eye contact. My soul is pretty void already so I just go on and ignore it.
She stands there and doesn't bag her groceries, so there's too many for me to continue scanning. So I stop to bag what there is. I have a huge line and the customers are rolling their eyes. I wave at a bag boy to come help, and continue scanning.
She just stands there and stares at the bagged groceries and doesn't put them in her cart. The bag boy is finishing up and isn't here yet.
So I finish with her total, take her money, thank her, get a blank silent stare.
I start the next customer, if this stupid idiot can't use her hands until the bag boy does it, then fine. I move her bags near her cart, start sliding the new customer's things beside her bags. Problem is, the new customer can't bag his items cause she is STILL STANDING THERE staring at me, not moving to the side, her cart in the way.
So, I decide to just go around and put her bags in her cart. But then the bag boy shows up so I stand there and watch. She finally leaves my register.
15 minutes later the store manager comes and tells me to close my lane and come talk to her. Apparently bitch-fest had complained that I had refused to bag her groceries or to put them in her cart. And she hadn't asked for bags so complained that I charged her for some o.O
When I mentioned I had bagged her groceries and was going to put them in her cart, I got in trouble for "thinking I can put the groceries in the cart". 
 Just WTF. You have hands and a voice, use them. I don't have magical mind-reading powers.
In my douchier days (about 14) I decided to mock the guy that does the intro to Tower of Terror. Made fun of him by waving my hands dramatically behind his back, etc. He was cool about it, pulled me aside, told me that he had to deal with bullshit kids and parents all day and that he would appreciate it if I didn't do it again (The park was almost empty and I was looping the ride). Cool guy, obviously. I apologized, said I was sorry for making his job harder than it had to be. Didn't fuck with him anymore, and he let me in first for the rest of the day (partly because I knew where the door was, but w/e.). Everything went better than expected.  
  
Disney people are cool.
Probably won't get read, but I live Houston and worked at Kroger around the time of Hurricane Ike. My dad was the store manager around this time and I worked at another store down the road. 
Anyways, after the Hurricane had passed my father and I went to check out the status of the store. It was bad. Power was out and the generator was supposed to kick it, but it didn't. My dad had to deal with disposing of a store with fridges full of potentially spoiled food. 
So my family and a few co-workers all come in and work the next 36 hours cleaning the store up. My dad get a call on day 2 of cleaning from the District Manager telling him to open the store that day at 10 AM. 
We had customers lining up early in the morning. It got bad real quick. Hardly any workers (my gf at the time and 15 year old brother were hired on the spot that day). 
I was checking out some asshat with his two asshat friends and he spots my dad and yells at him that they are out of Miller Lite. My dad says, "Well, we'll get it when we get it!" The guy then goes on to yell out loud how it is outrageous that they have a store that is up and running without essential products. Then he goes on to say that my dad doesn't know what the hell he's had to deal with. 
I'd had enough at this point and sternly stare the guy in the eyes and say, " You are absolutely right! He has no idea what you or anyone else has had to deal with! Not because he doesn't care. No, he doesn't know because he's been too damn busy throwing away half the merchandise in this store, an estimated $10,000, and trying to get this store up and running so you could come here and stock up on chex mix and cheese whiz. However, I'm sure you could try one of the other stores in the area to find your damn Miller Lite. No wait, no one else is open." 
The rest of his check out was silence. 
asshat get mad over Miller Lite, yells at my dad. I serve him a dose of STFU.

Alright, I've got one about an unruly customer, and one where I had a "That shut her up" moment with my manager.
So, first with the customer. I used to work at a grocery store called Publix (kinda large chain in South East US), and absolutely *loved* working the express lane. My rationalization was this: nobody's supposed to have more than ~10 things. So, if there's a terribly bitchy customer, I get the order done fast, and they're on their way. 
This chain closes for Thanksgiving, and pretty much everyone knew that in the area. So, the day before is always *packed!* I mean, every register is open, every person in the store with cash certification has a drawer out, even the store manager was working a lane. Despite this, each line was still ~5 people deep. Now, my store manager always wants the express lane open, and nobody else wants to do it, so I get the honors. I'm also expressly told that I'm not to allow *anybody* who has more than 10 items.
Cue the only person in the store who has a hand basket! He's standing patinetly in the line next to mine, and is holding his little, green hand-basket! I wave him over, but he declines, saying "No, I've got 13, and your sign says '10 or fewer.'"
I give him a "Do you think I care what the sign says" look, and say "Don't worry about it, you'll be fine."
So, I get him checked out, and he goes on his merry way.
Immediately behind him, though, Mrs. Bitch-face (with her ~2 year old daughter) starts unloading her *two* carts onto my conveyor belt. I turn it off, and politely ask her "Ma'am, is there anything I can help you with?"
She gives me this high-and-mighty look, and waves me to start ringing up her order, while she finishes putting things on the belt. 
I tell her, now a little annoyed "I'm sorry, Ma'am, but you obviously have too many items to go through this line."
She looks up and says "Yes, but you let that man through, and *he* had more than 10."
I say "He had 13. Let's count your's, shall we?" I start counting, get to 50 before I stop and say "It's plainly obvious that you have too much. [To the person behind her] Next customer to the express lane, please!"
She stares at me, and lets off the "Oh, but there's two people for this order, so we'll be fine."
I say "Ma'am, your daughter is two, and can't speak, let alone complete a transaction. Also, it says '10 or fewer,' *NOT* '10 or fewer per person.' Even if it DID, you *still* have too much. Please go to another line."
She gets right up in my face, pokes my chest and says "Listen, kid, I'm an adult! You have to *listen* to me!"
I look her dead in the eyes and say "I may not yet be an adult in *your* eyes, but at least *I* can count to 10!"
Bitch-face blushes, complains to my manager, and I never see her again. Later, my manager gave me a high-five for how I handled that.

The other story happened when I worked at my Uni's student union. 
I'd been hired with the promise that I was allowed to do homework at the help-desk, as long as it didn't interfere with helping customers. A year after I get hired, some new manager comes in, and changes the policy so I can't use my laptop at the help-desk anymore. I, being the diligent student, broke this rule at every opportunity, and always had homework on my screen.
So, spring break comes, and the entire help-desk staff (save for me) called out. I'm working open to close on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, until someone else comes back into town to actually work. The building manager and I get into a little spat, because I have my laptop out, which is resolved by me copying all my homework files onto the computer we use for lost &amp; found (highly against policy, but the only thing he'd allow for some reason), and I keep working. 
The first and only 'customer' I'd seen that day comes up, and has a problem installing a program onto her netbook. Specifically, she doesn't have a CD drive. I tell her I'm going to make an ISO with my computer, put it on my flash drive, and install it onto her computer with a virtual disk drive. 
Half-way through the process, my supervisor comes out and starts berating me for having my laptop on the desk again. So, I go back to the customer, and say loud enough for my supervisor to hear "I'm sorry, but my manager won't allow me to finish the operation. Also, it can't be saved part-way through, so you can't resume later. However, if you go to the library, campus tech support *might* still be open, and they *might* help you, even though you're not faculty."
My manager was SO pissed! When I turned in my 2 week's notice that day (I just couldn't stand it anymore), she instead fires me. From what I hear, they had to have the department head fill my Tuesday shift, and asked one girl to come back to campus early to cover my Wednesday shift.
**** Holy fuck that's long! Sorry! 
First story: Bitch-face tries to go through the express lane with more than 50 items, I shut her up and insult her intelligence.
Second story: Make my manager at a different job look like an ass in front of a customer. She fired me later that day, after I turn in my 2-weeks notice.
I would agree that Capitalism encourages laissez-faire policies, but it is important to define both "unfair" and "innocent". Imo, (though I do not claim it as original thought) monopolists come about as a result of something being made illegal or prohibivly expensive with certain people being given exemptions. The most extreme example of this is professional licences that prohibit people from jobs unless they buy something from a particular person or group favored by government (schools, regulatory agencies, etc). I am not arguing against the system, but that monopolies are created when the system is abusive more often than a person abusing the system.
I think everyone is for regulation, it is just a matter of who, what, where, when, and how a person can impose such a regulation is the issue. Pollution RARELY only harms the person doing the polluting and outside agreements between potentially harmed parties, a community standard can be applied to determine restitution. By contrast, the EPA that can not legally be competed with and generally considers any statutory restitution to be owed to the EPA, not to the people harmed. A way I think the EPA could be effective as a national regulatory agency is to be a place information can be freely published and criticized in order for individuals, regulatory companies, or courts to use as evidence to support claims of harm by individuals rather than thinking of the party harmed is "society".
I will agree that coming up with enforceable regulations that are compatible with "pure capitalism" are difficult, but people solve amazing problems all the time. I think it is possible even though I don't know what all those answers would be. We need to allow more people to try and solve them. I believe the result will be a superior and more liberal system.
As a person pro-regulation, our anti-capitalist system creates regulatory agencies inferior to our potential.
I'm not against taxes, I'm against using taxes to influence and control, and to create institutionalized social programs. 
Help doesn't come from government, however well meaning they may be. To receive help from a charity that receives any government funding, you need to meet government set criteria, which often times those most in need cannot meet.
Real help comes from individuals, who choose to help those in need with their time, skills, and extra resources. 
The government, especially the American government is instead there to intercede to protect rights, and to oversee interstate and international relations. When I say rights, I don't mean what rights has come to mean today. Commodities-food, healthcare, water, housing, those aren't rights. Rights can't be given, and can't be taken away, only infringed upon and violated. Rights like life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, ideas, morals, religion, free thought, these can't be taken away, only violated. These are rights every man woman and child is born with. These rights are guaranteed, up to the point where they violate someone else's rights: someone is a threat to the lives of others, keeping someone alive requires taking freely from someone else's livelihood and pursuit of happiness simply because they have and the other doesn't... If everyone in need was simply given what they need from what someone else has, why would the someone that had continue to try and get more? It'll only be taken from them again anyway, so there in no need to be innovative and work towards a better tomorrow. 
 Taxation is fine, when used to fund the responsibilities of the government: to protect rights, which can't be given or taken, only violated. Rights can not be commodities. Charity provides commodities, and government funded charities create more problems than the solve.
No. It's how you WISH things would work. And believe me, I wish they worked that way to.
It sucks shit being unemployed, and having no family to fall back on to help, and I know many others are going through worse than that right now.
 Government regulated civility and government regulated charity  at best creates a negative attitude about people who need help, at worst, puts them in a situation where no one will help them, because it's the government's responsibility not theirs. Besides, when is the government competent at anything, let alone charity?
Also, they make more because people are willing to pay more for their skills/services/ideas/education/whatever they have that allows them to earn so much money. Is it fair from the perspective of someone who sees them making a shload of money while doing less work? No. However, someone thinks whatever they have is worth paying for. If we take away the money and give it to people who don't have whatever is worth paying for, what incentive is there to do that job, and work to make more money? If there is no competition, no drive, if you can simply get everything you need from the government without trying especially hard to better yourself, then why would anyone bother to do anything worthwhile?
Most people aren't rich because they are cheating the poor. They're rich because they have a marketable skill, idea, education, or pretty near anything else people are willing to pay for. 
Most poor people I know aren't poor because they've been cheated, they're poor because they lack either education, skill, marketable ideas, or luck. Luck plays a big part, but luck isn't controllable. 
Government enforced charity isn't charity, and people come to resent it, and those in need of help who receive it.
Government enforced charity doesn't work, it just makes things worse. 
Something I always wonder is "what gear is safe?"
I got a mesh jacket, and the thing feels like it will fly apart if I hit the ground fast, but I just don't know.  I have mesh pants, and they feel safe, but as far as I know they'll melt if the bike falls on me.
At this point, I think the number one factor that stops people from wearing the proper gear is not knowing what's "proper."
There are plenty of motorcycle boots out there that offer zero impact protection for the shins (not good), and plenty of jackets that I'm sure would shred at 70+ MPH, but I just don't know.  Nobody does.  When you look at the review pages for motorcycle gear, they all say the same thing: "it looks nice, but I don't know how well it will handle in a crash."
Well... that's the important part.
- I wish we had a ratings system that showed us how safe gear was.  Something like: zero stars (poly mesh), one star (blue jeans), two stars (cheap padded mesh), three stars (cheap padded codura), four stars (racing leathers), five stars (motoport)
Just so everyone knows, Brink and New Vegas were not made by Bethesda, they were just distributed by Bethesda. New Vegas did use the same base mechanics and such, since Obsidian used the same engine and core resources for New Vegas.
However, Brink is being made by Splash Damage and distributed by Bethesda.
 FONV and Brink aren't/weren't made by Bethesda.
(speaking form an independent developer standpoint) Publishers are the moneybags of the equation.
You're a Dev House that wants to make a game. You need to pay your salaries, benefits, electric bills, rent, and more. If you're making a console title, you need dev kits, and it costs to get the game approved by the console owner. It costs money to get the game rated by the ESRB and other ratings boards, etc.. You also likely don't have in-house testers. Or at least not enough of them, and hiring a QA team costs money as well. The publisher will sign a contract with you that you will provide them a game, and they will provide you money to make the game.
- The publisher has bags of money in the bank, and they give it to developers who make them a game, and then the publisher makes that money back on the game's sales. (for independent devs at least)
The term "cutting weight" does not refer to any specific practice. Body builders, boxers, MMA fighters, cyclists, basically any athlete that needs to weigh less than their normal weight for any reason (to display muscles, to fit into a weight-class, or to lighten the load) goes through periods of "cutting."
Cutting often involves increasing the number of meals throughout the day, while significantly cutting back on the caloric content of each meal. For instance, while bulking, I'll consume 4000-5000 calories/day. While cutting I'll reduce to roughly 1200 calories/day while eating about 5 meals. [Somewhat counter-intuitively, this helps you lose weight. Your metabolism remains high, thus preventing your body from storing excess fat, while keeping caloric intake low.] Cutting also typically involves increased cardiovascular exercise. While cutting, I try to run and bike twice per day for 45 minutes each.
Each class of athlete also has specific practices: body builders will completely cut carbs out of their diet for about 6 days before a competition, and consume massive amounts of water during those 6 days. On the day before the show, they then eat massive amounts of carbs and drink very little water. The body dehydrates, and your muscles become extremely visible... ever wonder how Ryan Reynolds got those abs in Blade: Trinity?
For fighters, however, this carb/water diet is a terrible idea, as it would have detrimental effects on athletic performance. Wrestlers, boxers, and MMA fighters (anyone with a weight class) will often try to sweat out as much water weight as they can to try to meet their weight requirement. When I weigh 185 pounds, I have a lot more force behind my punch than when I weigh 160. If I can temporarily reduce my weight in a way that is easy to recover quickly (i.e. the time between a weigh-in and a fight), that is ideal. Time in the sauna, high sodium diet, sauna suit, even diuretics are all quick ways to lose some water weight without leaving a lasting impact on your physical performance.
Cutting weight simply refers to losing weight while maintaining maximum possible muscle mass. Different athletes do this in different ways; MMA fighters cut fat and water weight to fit into their agreed upon weight division.
The point is that even if they want to see their dead loved ones again its not okay to take it out on atheists. Saying what's the point in this condones the idea that atheists deserve to be seen as less because the religious can't handle the idea that there is no afterlife.
We don't deserve that. It's not okay to continue to let people do that. And why equate all atheists to that analogy? Not only are not all of us like that, but the act of saying "there is no afterlife and this is the only life you or your loved ones have" as your analogy suggests is not an act which deserves the punishment of being the frowned upon people that we are.
 stop treating all Christians like babies having a tantrum and make them act like adults; they can hve their beliefs, but the discrimination against atheists needs to stop. That's the point.
You're asking a potentially very interesting question.
It's *probably* doubtful that the world (or whatever your particular chunk of it) is going to hell.  Individual mileage may vary as local circumstances are quite variable.
As far as I can tell - it's really really really difficult to actually objectively tell what the current trend is in hell futures.   My hunch is it veers a bit here and there one way or the other and occasionally it veersr both ways at the same time, or at least sideways, for lack of a better term, which is complicated and more than a bit disorienting.
Somebody in this thread already mentioned the Cuban Missile Crisis which did not actually lurch full on towards hell but the potential was way, way, way closer than most people would have liked.  There was also a similar but lesser [known incident]( in 1983.   
But those are rare close brushes with relative singularities - noteworthy because of the very large and quantifiable hell-ness associated with negative outcomes.
I think the more interesting part of the question is examining the cumulative and much less clear events that are relatively frequent and day to day.  Each individual event or change may not affect things that much but might contribute to a greater whole in a unforeseeable or unpredictable way.  And as actual evidence (or consensus) might take a while to become clear - it really gets difficult to figure out what might have caused a sudden or difficult to reverse swing into badness.
Here's a relatively clear thought experiment.  All this hullabaloo (rebellion against governments) in the mideast?  Well, it's interesting.  It seems like it's been on the low simmer for a while and it then it just sort of happened.  It might make the world a better place.  It might not.  On one hand - it might fundamentally change the way the government has to govern in the mid east.  More representative, more accountable, less jerky.  This is a positive thing, right?  But on the other hand maybe the populaces get crushed and the oppressive governments become more confident in their jack boots and get *more* oppressivey.  
...or it could spark an open hot conflict and pull in major powers in conflict and start of WW3.  (Israel and Iran call each other even harher names, people are all tense, airstrikes on critical Iran targets, US puts boots on the ground, holy shit, it's *on*.  But there's more!  Russia uses the confusion to invade one of those uppity 'stans, China gets pissed off at being left out and takes Taiwan... powie zowie, I wish I was Swiss.) 
Well, that was fun - but that's relatively clear.  Maybe not that likely, probably.  
What about the more difficult to gauge changes?  Is France banning the niqab a net positive or negative?  (I expect it's a little of both, no matter where you might stand on the issue).  iPhone is a positive or negative?  (Again, probably mixed.  New communications technology can often result in broad populist good.  Successful closed system is often detrimental to a market's development.)  These are two milestones in long complex developments with complex antecedants and largely intangible net benefit that may take a long time to become clear.
Well, enough about the fuzziness of hell future.  I've got one other big point.  Remember that at the beginning of my comment I spoke about 'individiaul results may vary'.  
This is important.  You are here to make the comment.  Think of all the lucky breaks that have occurred for you to be here making this comment and not, well.... dead.  Or not even existing.  Our planet is the right distance from the sun.  A meteor hasn't hit for a long time and there might have been all sorts of near misses in our civilization's past.  The sun hasn't exploded (let me get back to you in 8 minutes to confirm).  The Cuban missile crisis didn't result in a nuclear exchange. 
Okokok, what's my point?  I'm suggesting that you are here.  This is proof that in the chain of events that led to now - it hasn't gone to hell for *you*.  However, I expect the world (at least from a certain point of view) has gone to hell for all sorts of people.   Dinosaurs?  Hell.  Except for the birds.  Dodo birds?  Hell.  WW2 - 50-70 million dead.  (I've always been fascinated by the siege of St. Petersburg.  900 days.  50% chance of death, including by cannibalism) I would think there's a substantial proportion of people in, say... Iraq where the last 2 decades have been less than perfectly pleasant.  Darfur?  Zimbabwe?  Sri Lanka?  Japan?
I think I'm trying to illustrate that portions of the world have been going to hell *all* *the* *time*, however you might define going to hell.  The whole universe has been going to hell since the beginning of time, you and I have just been lucky enough to not be in the helly parts.
  Is the World going to hell?  Probably. Not sure where exactly or why... it's hard to tell.  I hope I'm lucky.





I think your awareness of what's going on in the world increases as you get older.  Until the age of 19 or 20 I was oblivious to everything not directly associated with me.  (I'm 45 now) I lived through Viet Nam, Nixon, the
Iran Hostage situation, Beirut and Ronald Reagan before I ever really noticed the world.
the world has always been going to hell you're just now noticing it.
Agreed with you 100%. Those in the service industry know 20% is actually standard now. Also note, the difference between 20 and 15 to you is maybe two or three dollars, but to the server it adds up and makes a hell of a difference. Plus, 20% is so much easier to calculate.
**TL; DR** Tip 20%, if you can afford to go out to eat, you can afford to tip.
All of Veitch's video's are horseshit, they never provide any decent arguments, they just go around calling the Royal Family ["parasites"]( without providing any actual evidence that they are harming the country. In the video linked above he even compares them to the Nazi's (2:10) and how they're part of the "New World Order"; what a fucking tool. Being anti-royalist is fine and all, and I agree that at least philosophically it is elitist and unfair; but he needs to stop being such a retard about it and provide some fucking **evidence!!** The reason he doesn't is because the truth of the matter is very far from his moronic and psuedo-intellectual rhetoric; 
TL:DR: Fuck Charlie Veitch and Silkie Carlo for being pompous, psuedo-intellectual hypocritical liars who wouldn't know the first thing about politics or activism if they slapped them both in the face with a wet herring.
In the US, the [search incident to arrest]( exception to the warrant requirement of the 4th Amendment means that the police can search, without warrant, anyplace nearby a suspect at the time of arrest.  
If they arrest you at your doorstep, this would only extend to five or ten feet inside the hallway. However, if they let you walk through your house, they can search any room you've walked through and (probably) any adjacent room; functionally your whole house.
Standard police procedure is therefore to encourage you to go get dressed, after which they handcuff you and search your whole house.
The theory behind this is you might grab a weapon or destroy evidence. So they need to be able to search where you've been after you're handcuffed and in the back of a police cruiser.
____ If the police show up with a warrant for your arrest and offer to let you get dressed, you say "No thanks," step out the door, and go to jail in your boxers like a fucking boss.
As much as I dislike what you I see in this video, the "crime" being committed would be an offence in the US as well. Nobody got tasered, nobody got punched in the face, nobody got treated like they were a second class citizen. Everyone is polite and well mannered.
So yeah, I like living in the UK, all my experiences with the police have been this way - scares the shit of me when I see US police videos quite frankly. Almost counter-intuitively this video made me happy to be living with in a country with a police force that behaves the way it does.
British police are fine. However, some of the laws suck.
The "I went to Cambridge" drop is so pretentious though, save it for the CV dear.
Our government was constructed with our history of revolution in mind, and set up so that we wouldn't ever be able to overthrow it.

We are content, as many have pointed out, with what our government gives us but are dissatisfied with what they take from us. 

Unfortunately, satisfaction is easily replaceable. Sugar and pretty lights seem to be just enough.

As for a protest, until someone takes away our sugar or unplugs our electronic connections, you won't see one. And then the scary part is, that at that point, the sheep will have no idea how to create a 'mass' or 'large scale' version of anything without mass communication.
Imagine trying to get a Reddit meet-up going without using the internet once. Okay, you can go to colleges and post fliers or ask around. But now imagine that if anyone found out you were a Redditor you risked jail time. Naturally your task becomes more difficult. So you may be able to find a handful of them at the work place or school but any more than that and exposure becomes too likely. 

When the people turn against the Gov't and the Gov't fights back, this is what it will look like. They've made us dependent on social media, and mass communication that people have long since lost the skill (or desire) to form any large movement in the real world. The government has pacified and sedated us with the tactical precision expected of ~~a~~ *the* world military power.

Give them credit though, the people who actually run this country are intelligent. They know exactly what they are doing and how they are doing it.

**TLDR** No, examining the end-case scenario by terms of a full scale revolution, it will never and can never happen. As much as we like to think we can change the government for the people, we are locked in with this one.
I disagree with all the "No, because we have x, y, z" people out there.
I think we can, but I don't think it's something that every single person in the US is going to get behind at the same time. I think it's something that needs to start small, grow bigger, and go on for more than a year or 2 for any real change to happen.
Basically you have to convince people they don't need the shit they have (shitty job, lackluster life, etc), and to throw it all away for hot hippie chicks, drugs, ignoring stupid rules, living on the road, and experiencing the simple things.
 Start small. Don't stop.
Liara in ME1.  She was really interested in me, and my Shepard was a pragmatist.  In ME2, we are reintroduced to her in a scene where she threatens to flay someone with her mind.  I assumed that she moved on...
After that, I found that Tali was interested, and well; Shepard the pragmatist.  Actually, it was more of a me-as-Shepard Role Playing thing with Tali.  Her loyalty mission was the best crafted mission in the game, and I actually kind of had an emotional connection to her and her people. (And the Geth, but you unfortunately can't romance Legion.)
The thing about Tali, is that she was never really a character; she was totally defined by being a Quarian.  Her romance addresses this, and she says that being with Shepard is the first thing that she's ever done, or even really wanted to do, for herself. It's not complicated, but it is heartfelt.
My main Femshep playthrough romanced Kaiden in ME1, because why not?  Then he was an idiot in ME2 and his letter said that he moved on.  Alrighty then.
She then romanced Garrus because she felt sorry for him, and his reach and flexability pun was hilarious.  (Actually, I've heard that Garrus is the most popular female romance, so I went with democracy)
I also have playthroughs with Miranda, as her character arc through romance is also very good (*accepting her accomplishments as her own, not the result of her genetics*), loyal to Ashley and Kaiden (*maybe they were having an off day on Horizon*), and loyal to Liara through LotSB; but none for Thane, Jacob or Jack.  I can't see being attracted to Jack (*she's chaotic, I couldn't trust her; though I heard that she has a good romance story, too*); I've heard that Thane gets **more** depressed when you romance him, so I wouldn't want to do that to him; and Jacob would just be another "because hey why not" romance, and I felt that staying loyal to Kaiden had more significance than ditching him to be with Kaiden 2.0 (*now with bigger pecs*).
Yeesh, that was long.  Tali and Garrus.
If, for riding after one month, you get the "I'm invincible" feeling, it's probably a good thing that you got some sense knocked into you. Don't worry, the same thing happened to me. Confidence will take time to build up. The only thing you can do is keep riding or stop riding. SkullDump said it and I will repeat it: after a month of riding, you know practically nothing and that your confidence was probably not justified. 

Do you know what went wrong in that corner? You need to figure this out. 

Good on you for wearing your gear.

I finally saw a dermatologist for my acne.  I never had ANY as a teen, and then when I was about 23 I started getting those, then it got worse and worse and worse.  I finally got on antibiotics, and Micro-retinA (I tried to avoid the harsher stuff at all costs, like Accutane).
I'm FINALLY acne free at 29.  
Go see a dermatologist.
Don't worry i am too. I played a game as AP teemo (recently bought and loving him) and right from the beginning i knew my teammates would be assholes. I clicked teemo and didn't lock in as usual and my team instantly started saying "OMG PLS NO TEEEMO HE IS SO BAD" and stuff like "OMG FUCKING NOOB PLS DONT PICK TEEMO" so right there i locked in. They don't know me, or my play style. Once i locked in they were saying "pls atleast go ad teemo" so i told em i'd play how i wanted to. 
around 2 minutes i was 5-2-10 because the xin zhao that told me i stucked was audacious charging all my kills and ksing like crazy. I'd ignite someone and hit em with my poison and as they would run away xin would charge them and ks them. Game ended and i was like 7-3-15 (surrendered) and we won. I said "I guess i'm not so bad as teemo since i'm the only one with greater than 2:1 kd." they said "no you still suck we carry"
assholes are everywhere. just show them up.
Once when I was sleeping with my fiance, and suddenly was woken with a punch in the face. I woke up immediately and yelled, "what the fuck." My fiance groggily said. "what? what's wrong?" I said, "you punched me in the face, what the hell?" Then he said, "I'm sorry, I thought you were a tauntaun."
My fiance punched in the face while we were sleeping because he thought I was a tauntaun.
Oh I think I might win this one.  I had just started living with my girlfriend (now fiancee), and one night I woke up to her saying something to me.  She told me, "I have to take the christmas tree out, the garbage men are coming."  Trouble was, it was the middle of August.
Suddenly she jumped out of bed and ran out to the living room.  I'd never witnessed sleepwalking before, and apart from a crazy sudden urge to take out a non-existent tree... she seemed to be acting completely normal.  My first thought was she'd had some horrible nightmare in which she desperately needed to take a tree out to the corner before we all died, and woke up from the dream still believing our lives were at risk.
Whatever it was, was very strange.  After about 5 minutes of her trying to figure out where the christmas tree was I finally just told her, "It's August, there's no tree.  Christmas isn't for months, and even then neither of us care about putting up decorations.  What are you talking about?"  For about 3 more minutes she accused me again and again of being a liar as she slumped sadly to her knees to cry hysterically.  I tried to give her a hug and told her a little more sternly, and loudly that "ITS AUGUST, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"  This was years ago and nothing more than occasional sleep mumbling has occurred since.
Suddenly she stopped crying.  Looked up at me and asked, "Wait, what are we doing in the living room, I thought... wait.  What's going on?  Why am I crying?  What the fuck?"  It took a few weeks before we were able to laugh about that one.

I once farted so loud I woke her up.  Once she realized what woke her up she started laughing pretty hard.  I woke up to that and laughed even harder than she was laughing once she told me what I did.  Not long after that she returned the favor.
- My fiancee had one sleepwalking incident in which she tried to take out a non-existent Christmas tree in the middle of August.  Also we've both farted so loud we woke the other up.
Edit: When I was a kid I walked into my parents room in the middle of the night and stood there motionless for a long time.  My parents somehow must have sensed someone was in the room and my mom was shocked to find me standing there in silence.  She asked if I needed something and I responded with an "ominous" tone, "**I NEED A NEW BED.**"  Immediately afterward I walked slowly and silently out of their room and went to sleep on the living room couch.  I had no recollection of this incident when I asked my mom how I ended up on the couch.
It's not much of a compliment, everything's good with cheese.
- Cheese carries all burdensome food.
I destroyed my friends tent.
I have a history of sleepwalking/talking and night terrors and they're usually worse while in places I'm unfamiliar with.  I went camping in the NC mountains over labor day last year.
I remember waking up and it feeling like a breeze but thought that was ridiculous because the fly was over the tent.  Nope.  There was a horizontal tear in the tent not on a seam, about a foot up off the ground and roughly a cubit in length.
The other campers thought I was getting eaten by a bear from the tone of my voice.  They said the abject terror in it sounded like something was killing me.  Evidently they got up and went outside and saw my fist punch through the side of the tent (they had heard a weird scratching noise and that's why they investigated--i probably punched through where I had scratched a small hole in it.)  They then said they saw me use both hands and tear it horizontally and then dive through the hole until my torso stuck out.  I looked up at them and said, "It's okay.  Go back to sleep," and then I retreated.  I remember nothing of this.

Hate that :( I recently got roped into being the designated driver for my younger cousin, who was going to a friend's house outside of town. These kids (~15 years old) had a case of lukewarm beer in the bathtub and were proceeding to get smashed, so I lit up a bowl to wait out the party. This one girl was all "No! You can't smoke here! It's illegal! We'll get in so much trouble!" Just, honey, what do you think that you're doing?
underage drunk kid got on to me for smoking because it's illegal
Woah yea I went to this place Pizza Margherita because I had like a $15 for $30 worth of food Groupon and I realized after growing up on sloppy ass pizzas I didn't like their dainty Neopolitan style.
Nevertheless, the Tutta Bella menu says that their pizzas are like 10-13$ so for two people going out to eat even if the food is bad that's only like 5-6 bucks a person so who cares.  
thanks for the heads up!
You're looking at it from a local perspective when it comes to teching up (since more people are actually getting to higher and more specialized education, just that it's not something you'd see in town every day); but I agree that a more solid tech base to protect any expansion attempts is a better idea. No sense going 14CC if you're going to get 9pooled or 2gated in a sense because we're unprepared for the rigors of maintaining multiple bases. Also, I'd rather that we get more value out of our econ, like prepping an OC so we can MULE/maynard asap at the expansion.
Tech to make the one base more efficient per resource used and facilitate a safe expansion is better than going tech to cheese ourselves in a TvT.
Nothing in terms of what? Life? Mineral resources? Gas? Investments in space or even weapon based programs have had more than just their space/military applications as their benefit; many products we currently see in today's markets are offshoots of money spent there being applied for commercial purposes.
Also, I don't want to point out why explorers have gone to the "nowheres" of this earth even as recently as fifty years ago; during the Space Race of all times.
Long-term macro investments in tech will eventually make space travel worth the price; and maybe even necessary at some point.
If you are dealing with prescriptions do NOT go to Target, or you will be screwed.
 
A few years ago, I took my prescription to Target to be filled.   No big deal.   When I went to pick it up,  the guy at the counter said "Your insurance doesn't cover this medication.  If you want it,  you'll have to pay $750.     Well, I didn't really have a choice, so I pulled out my credit card and gave $750 to Target for my medication.   Ouch.
 
My next doctor's appointment,  I brought it in, and told him,  "Can you put me on something else?   My insurance doesn't cover this, and I don't know if I can afford $750 a month for medicine."     He said,   you have blue cross, right?   I know they cover it,  I prescribe it all the time.   Let me see your bottle.   he looked at it and said,   Hmm,  this is the right stuff,   I guess maybe they changed their formulary or something.   But why didn't you at least get the generic,   that's MUCH cheaper,  it'll cost you only a couple hundred bucks.    You only have a few months left, and if you go with the generic,  I think this will be your best bet.  I told him Target never told me there was a generic option,  but  I agreed that since I was already in for $750, I didn't want to start from scratch.
 
Forward to next prescription.   I go back to Target, and this time I tell them "I want the generic brand."   The guy at the counter says I need to talk directly to the pharmacist.   Fine.    She eventually comes out front, and I tell her "I want the generic"  She tells me,   "I don't fill prescriptions with Generics unless it's specifically required by the prescription, and it's not for yours,  so I won't do it unless I hear from your doctor."   I tell her,  "Get the phone,  we can call my doctor right now,  I know he's ok with generics, since he's the one who suggested it."    I get my doctor on the phone, who tells the pharmacist that, duh,  generics are the same damn thing, and yes,  she should fill it with generic.
Eventually she gives in and tells me I can have the generic.  Come back in a couple hours and I can pick up my script.
 
I come back after they call to tell my it's been filled.   How much is it?  (this time I am prepared, and have 8 $100 bills with me)
 
"Well, the generic is covered by your insurance,  so your copay is $12."
 
WTF!!

The next month, I go to Wal-Mart,    I don't have to request anthing specifically,   when I go to pick it up...   No charge.
 
Target - $750 
Wal-Mart - Free 
same prescription,  same insurance....

Target only fills with name brands so their profit margin is higher.  Most insurance will allow this and either pay the whole cost, or only make you pay the difference,  so normaly, you probably wouldn't even notice this, and just think that's how much it costs,  since you may only be paying an extra 10 bucks,  20 bucks,  or your insurance is.
 
  Never EVER go to Target for prescriptions unless you want to be ripped off.

I'll try to lay out a few possible reasons for why people are homophobic, and the short answer is: bigotry comes in many forms, and all are insidious. Please note: this list is not exhaustive. 
1) **Homophobia as reinforcement of categories.** Professor Elizabeth Young-Bruehl, a psychotherapist, makes the point that homophobia is quite unique among other kinds of hatreds in that it starts off as a  hatred of certain acts, which is then extended to a class of people. Other hatreds, e.g. antipathy to blacks or women, are expressed in terms of general categories. She suggests that homophobes hate acts that they themselves can and usually do engage in, so, to repudiate these acts they must assign them clearly to another category of people. The category is all that stands between them and those acts. [See this awesome book for more.](
2) **Homophobia as an extension of sexism.** Male prejudice against gay males is a form of sexism. It is part of male denigration of femaleness. The psychoanalyst [Richard Isay]( has argued that fear of homosexuality per se is secondary in homophobic men to their fear and hatred of what they perceive as feminine in other men and in themselves.
For this reason, men are not generally prejudiced against lesbians, who present no threat to their masculinity. However, some men view butch lesbians as competitors for the attention of women, and see in femme lesbians a spurning of men. Sometimes we see the reaction where the men say, let’s show them what real love is -- and from here, it’s a short hop to sexual assault (i.e., "corrective rape")
3) **Homophobes are authoritarian, status conscious, intolerant of ambiguity and rigid** Researchers using questionnaires and interviews have developed a profile of the homophobic person. He or she is authoritarian, status conscious, intolerant of ambiguity, and both cognitively and sexually rigid. But the homophobes thus profiled are motivated less by conventional sexual morality than by a desire to preserve a double standard between the sexes, that is, to preserve traditional-- traditionally sexist--masculine and feminine gender roles. [See here for more.](
4) **Homophobia as internal anxiety redirected outwards** Some researchers have postulated that homosexuality is an anxiety-based phenomenon. Psychoanalytic theories suggest that homophobia is a result of repressed homosexual urges. Anxiety about homosexuality typically does not occur in individuals who are same-sex oriented. Instead, it usually involves individuals who are ostensibly heterosexual but have difficulty integrating their homosexual feelings or activity. [See here for more.]( 
5) **An "Us v. Them" mentality.** This is the subconscious belief that if someone else is granted rights, those rights come at one's own expense. You see this play out in most forms of oppression. One of the most common reasons why some oppose gay marriage is that it will somehow threaten or devalue the heterosexual institution of marriage. In order for one person to have rights, the rights of another are somehow infringed upon (another classic example: when women were granted the right to vote, the general view wasn't that women gained the right to vote, but that men's right to vote was devalued as a result). Just how that would happen is never explained, but those who agree with the notion don't have to explain; to them it seems a reasonable proposition, because they feel the threat, even if they can't put their finger on why. Obviously, this reason is an emotional reaction rather than a reasoned argument. Yet the fact that it is simply an emotional reaction is not relevant to the bigot; he believes that since he believes it, it must be true. And that is good enough.
6) **Perceived loss of control over one's environment.** Someone who lives life in a manner quite different that oneself represents a threat to that individual. The threat is a threat to the ego in the sense that one's own choices may prove not to be optimal; it is also a subconscious threat to one's security in the sense that the other may prove to be more successful. This is yet another emotional, illogical response, but one that drives a homophobe to rail against those who do not share their heterosexual preference. 
7) **Threat to one's own world view.** Very similar to point 6, above. When someone has held to the same ideas and has staunchly advocated them all of his life, someone else who says he's wrong can be rather threatening. A person who was raised (by the church, by the media, what have you) to believe that homosexuality is "unnatural, wrong, perverse, etc" and committed those values to heart endure very strong cognitive dissonance. "This is what I've been told and I've believed all my life, so therefore it must be right, otherwise what I've been taught is wrong." It's a very egotistical, self-centered, and arrogant way of thinking, but hey, when you're dealing with bigots, is that surprising at all?
That's what I've got for now. Maybe that will help shed some light to your query. There has been a lot of work done in the academic community about understanding homophobia and it's origins. If you're up to it, I would suggest cross-posting to r/lgbt or r/feminisms and ask their opinions. 
EDIT: Hm, downvotes. Interesting. Por que? 
EDIT 2: Forgot to add a **** Here it is: There are many possible academic explanations which assess the origins of homophobia. Here are a few. 
**EDIT 3**: Wow, thanks for all the responses! This is exactly the kind of discussion I was hoping for! Ok, since there have been quite a few posts about this, I just wanted to add what I perceive are common justifications for homophobia, which are often confused for the origins themselves. 
**It's not natural.** Some people cite to evolutionary theory to explain and describe why homophobia is "wrong." They say that since two men or two women cannot have a baby together, it is not natural. This is a very weak argument, because there have been hundreds of studies on homosexuality found in nature (in other species besides humans, but especially in our ape-like cousins--like bonobos and chimps). Among humans, homosexuality is found in all cultures and with about the same frequency it is found in America. Cultural norms seem to have little influence on the incidence of homosexual behavior.
**It is a perversion.** This is really a variation of the "it's not natural" argument, and so there's no need to reiterate what has been said in the above, other than to say that it is the"natural" argument with a religious overtone. In many religions, homosexuality is called wrong, or base, or immoral (for the origins of why religious leaders might have said this in the first place, see the above origins), and these emotional markers coupled with the "not natural" argument creates: "it is a perversion." Religion has had a huge impact on many societies--here in America, overtones of puritanism, catholicism, and christianity have dominated the cultural mindset, effecting the individual mindsets of many Americans who may not even otherwise subscribe to religious beliefs. That said, I am not trying to say that all people who are religious are automatically homophobes or bigots--I am merely trying to point out that, within the dominant religious community (i.e., "The Church"), homosexuality is seen as "perverse," incorrectly so. 
**It is against G-d's law.** This argument it presumes that the homosexual is or should be bound by the religious principles that are propounded here by the religionist. To make the logical leap that because this religionist thinks that gay marriage is against G-d's law and therefore we should not make gay marriage legal, is to attempt to encode in a secular law an idea that has purely religious purposes. Until the religionist can come up with a sound reason why society benefits by the outlawing of homosexual activity, then there is no moral basis for such a law if one accepts the principle of religious freedom as encoded in the doctrine of the separation of church and state.
**It's disgusting.** Some people are offended at the idea of homosexuality because seeing two men kissing is "disgusting." They therefore justify their homophobia and their reasons against gay marriage with this outcry. There are many things that go on in society that some might consider "disgusting," but we don't outlaw them just because of that. "Disgusting" is a subjective perspective, not an objective assertion of fact. A homosexual person might consider a heterosexual person's activities "disgusting,"  but if anyone thought that we should outlaw heterosexual marriage just because some homosexual people thought it was "disgusting," it would be shot down as a ludicrous idea. Tolerance and respect are two-way streets, and while a person's view that certain acts are "disgusting or gross" is their own opinion, that should not be the basis for restricting the lifestyle choices of another. 

You didn't ask for my two cents, but I've wondered the same thing about myself for many years, and I do have one experience that clarified this for me. 
When I lived in Bangladesh for most of a year, I'd notice that straight men would often walk hand-in-hand down the street. It wasn't sexual or romantic in any way, in fact, it was kind of a "bro" thing to do. As I made male friends of my own, I found I just couldn't feel comfy walking hand-in-hand with a man. It just seemed "off" . . . until I sort of got used to it. Near the end of my stretch in the country, it wasn't a big deal and I'd do it occasionally when I'd be walking with a Bangladeshi bro. To me, that made it clear that my previous level of discomfort was a conditioning thing that could be undone.
Now, when I feel grossed out by the thought of gay sex, I don't really sweat it. I see myself as engaged in a slow process of undoing my conditioning, and as long as I'm not lording my conditioning over someone else, it's not like I'm somehow evil because of it. I don't let on to my gay friends that it seems icky to me; I work at an easy pace to make it not seem icky. In fact, I think it's often much healthier to deal with the little biases we have than to pretend they're not there.
I think you're on the right track.
To be perfectly honest the Chinese have the equivalent of Facebook and Twitter. The only reason they ban facebook and twitter is because of CIA's freepass to the data and using it as a device to spam / draw Chinese netizens' attention with free Tibet / freedom of speech info. After that, they released a Chinese version of Twitter and FB (the twitter also has a 140character limit, i believe) where the central government can also moniter the data and private info its users put onto their "fb/twitter", and also remove unwanted contents (this is also done by fb, but at a much less extent).
Chinese gov dont want American controlled FB/twitter, so they sponsor/copy a version for themselves instead.
A rough list of stuff that the Chinese ban can p much be summed up in a few categories: foreign propaganda (anything freedom of speech, rights and free Tibet related), foreign social network sites(and replace them with Chinese ones), and more disturbing aspects of porn (CP, and some others...)
I'm sorry, but you need to consider the guidelines for writing on the web, number 1 is that no matter how many lines you think should make a paragraphs it's too many.
 breaking up the text will give more readers and better responses, even with the same amount of text.
I felt like I was in a similar boat a year or two back.  I had moved to a new city with no friends or family outside of my girlfriend of four years that I went to college with.  She was rather shy, so didn't have a lot of friends to introduce me to.  I worked at the time at a catering job for a franchise restaraunt, so friends from work were hard to come by.  Many were barely out of high school if that and the rest were married with families.  It was hard, but I developed hobbies such as web coding and managed a small website community.  I didn't have a more satisfying experience until I finally got a better job with coworkers that I could relate to.  My (ex) girlfriend ended up moving away to med school in another state about three months into my new job.  I've been able to reestablish a network of friends in my new city now l, but I wish I had started sooner by finding hobby groups.  I find it helps a lot to exposure yourself to new people and show an interest in them.  It does take more effort to establish a friendship than it might have in college in my experience, so be proactive. If you show an interest and invite people to do things, they might do the same for you.
 be proactive, get a hobby, actively invite people places.
&gt;If you were in a good enough position to have sex, you should be prepared for whatever effects that may have.
I'm sorry, but I HATE HATE HATE this line of reasoning. Would you say the same thing to someone who got shot because they happened to be in a bank when it was getting robbed? If someone you know was injured from a car accident on the way to pick up a pint of ice cream would you say "well, they knew accidents could happen while driving; they should have been prepared for the consequences"?
This type of argument is only used when it's for something that society doesn't consider acceptable. Sex? Be prepared! Smoking? Well, you should have known! Eating the typical unhealthy over-processed American diet and getting cancer? You poor thing! 
 No bueno.

Yeah he did. But this happens literally ALL of the time in nature documentaries..this is part of how nature documentaries are made the simple fact is it's impossible to appropriately capture some natural phenomena in nature. 
For instance, if you want to get a high speed shot of a chameleon grabbing a bug with it's tongue. It would be next to impossible to find one, get close enough to it to set up a complicated camera. Light it and than wait for it to catch a bug before moving away. So they make a fake forrest scene and set one up on a branch in a studio.
It still represents nature  better than we would be able to without faking it. It just isn't naturally occurring footage. I find no moral fault in this.
 Yes but it happens all the time and there's nothing wrong with it.
When I was... 11ish?(this would make my little sister around 6) I thought, "hey, it would sure be funny to play dead and freak my little sister out!" 
So I'm laying there on the floor with my face towards the carpet. She comes into the room and I'm suppressing a smile I feel like I've got her...
Then she starts *jumping on my head*. I'm *dead* and the little booger *jumps on my head*. 
Worst part is it took a while to get out of the situation... can't exactly move or say much when your face is being smashed into the carpet... This should not be the first reaction to your sibling's "death". ಠ_ಠ
I played dead, sister jumps on head smashing my face into floor.
Not the worst thing, but a funny story. 
This was when I was in maybe Kindergarten, my little brother being still in diapers. I remember being in the TV room across the hallway from our bedroom, and coming back into our room to find my big blanket spread across the entire floor with my little brother standing next to the corner nearest my bed. After a little bit of not knowing what was going on, my mom came upstairs to tuck us in and pulled the blanket off the ground--much to my little brother's dismay. Why, one may ask, was the floor covered with the blanket? Because my little brother pooped on the floor. Just stood there and took a dump. And being the 2-3 year old he was, taking my blanket and covering the entire floor was the best option. 
** My little brother pooped on the floor and covered the entire floor with my blanket**
I called my 16 yr old nephew to ask him what happened to the grass deflector thing that snaps onto the blade deck of a push lawnmower that belongs to my mom, his grandmother, that he was the last one to use.  I asked him if he would buy a new one if he didn't know where the old one was.  I did this on his voice-mail.  The next day my sister came to my work.  I raise chickens for the state of Florida.  I was outside the building that houses the chickens, but I heard her shout some MFers and some SoB's and some where the fuck are you's.  She slammed the front door to the building.  I walked through the back door and into the kitchen area of the building.  No stove, but a big sink and refrigerator.  She threw some plastic grass deflectors at me and said, "Is this what the fuck you want you piece of shit?"  I said, "one of them is."  then I sort of got a little mad.  We traded a bunch of cussing at each other, and she went out and sat in her 1999 Toyota 4 runner, parked out front.  She was starting to leave, but had asked me to help her with some Department of Children and Family Services problems she had had a few months earlier.  I had put a couch and love seat on a credit card for her so that she would have what they called appropriate furniture.  She still owed me like 800 dollars.  I went out to her car and said, Please pay me the money you owe me as soon as possible."  She told me to fuck off.  I called her a whore and turned away from her window to walk back into my building.  She drove her Toyota into me, and knocked me forward.  I had to roll away from the front tires, but I did.  My ankle popped like 6 times.  I was on crutches for a week.  I limped for 3 months.  I was pretty lucky I didn't break it.  Cops were not helpful.  Work made me call them.
TL; DR:  Sister ran into me with her 4 runner when I asked about a lawnmower part.
My wife and I do the same thing.  She sleeps in the bed I and I on the couch.  We both have different schedules and I am a bit of a snorer.  Her parents have the same arrangement, but her dad sleeps on the couch because of some Vietnam PTSD issues (he can't sleep if it is totally dark and quiet around, so he sleeps with the lights and tv on.)
My parents never slept apart and thought that we were separated when they found out.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  As far as our relationship, it couldn't be stronger.
We haven't had a serious fight in more than a year.  We are complete opposites and have learned to be tolerant of each others oddities.  I am a total wallflower who played video games in school and only had a small handful of friends(at the three high schools I went to) and she was the captain of the varsity football cheerleaders. We both have different tastes in television (I like Mythbusters, she catches every ep of Jersey Shore and The Hills), different tastes in music (she likes everything you might expect from someone who watches those shows, I like all the other stuff) and different ways to spend our spare time (I play the hell out of old video games and build stuff by myself;she likes to go out with her friends and be social).  As long as we keep our differences in mind and have a good sense of humor, our relationship remains strong.
So strong, in fact, that, after 10yr, we are the only couple still together of all our friends who got married in college.
- I am a dork who married the cheerleader and we sleep separately, even though we rock.
If you're going to link a page in relation to an obscure Catholic doctrine you might want to link a piece that actually defines it, or at least explains it, in any way. This link is double talk to get around the teachings of the Catholic church. 
 Link drops the word 'subsidarity'; Doesn't explain.
I have to disagree. I don't think he did anything wrong, all he did was take what the player gave him and expand upon it to force a little character development. Isn't that the purpose of writing character backgrounds to begin with? Also, from experience I can tell you that talking Mary Sue characters over with their players generally doesn't work. One of my best friends, who I have been playing with for almost ten years, pretty much only makes bland, generic, characters: either "he is a peasant" or "he is a noble". We have tried talking it over with him, and we may end up writing up a character background with/for him with his begrudging consent, but he nevertheless plays the same character and none of the personality or background gets used by the DM because he doesn't really know what to do/where he wants his character to go. The only times he has ever actually taken his character anywhere is when the DM has thrown some personal issue at him and forced him to deal with it, and those have been the characters he has loved the most. I only wish those games had gone on longer, so maybe he could have seen the benefits of actually making character personalities and backgrounds.
{ From my experience, the best way to teach Mary Sue players the benefits of actual characters is to allow them to grow their own character and develop the personality from what the DM throws at them.
"Overthrowing the state" is one thing (violently or peacefully).  The "collapse of industrialization" is another thing entirely.  If our current system of government was suddenly replaced with something far more egalitarian, participatory, decentralized, etc., we'd still live in an industrialized economy (I'm arguing from a U.S. perspective here, but all other countries are in the same situation).  The realities of mass-shipments of food, fuel, cars, computers, you name it, have little to do with whether we're a "democracy" or a fascist dictatorship, and everything to do with how post-industrial revolution free-market capitalism panned out.  My political leanings are definitely far-left but I've always felt the "society's collapse is imminent" conspiracy theories to be a bit of a stretch. Yes, the United States runs a trade deficit.  I can foresee a world one day where the dollar does not set the bar for the world's currency markets.  Realistically, were hyperinflation ever to seriously impact the countries of the G-8, the countries representatives, along with the World Bank and the IMF would immediately come up with plans to stabilize everything (worth noting: at the end of the day, I'm a "money's not real" kind of guy).  
I'm all for the urban chicken movement.  I'm all for the locovore movement.  I'm definitely against industrial farming.  For everything else here, I read too much of the business press to start getting into the idea of cooking road kill and shit.  The General Electrics of the world are doing fine.  The Telecoms are doing fine.  Oil, while definitely a finite resource with diminishing supplies, is going to be around for a few decades, easy.  CEOs of the major oil companies were being drilled by congress TODAY for posting record profits while receiving large tax breaks.   
So, yeah.  If you're serious about having a mass political movement, I think it's important to be realistic about where society is at.  And, honestly, in terms of getting a movement to grow, it has to be firmly rooted in logic and rationality, i.e. being able to discuss with people of all backgrounds what society SHOULD look like and, more importantly, why.  
-- Yeah, man.  I'm verbose :(
There is always authority.  I am looking for the maximum individual authority.  ..and I would not be so cocky considering your country is broke.  Mine is too, for the same reasons.  It is against all economic principles I believe in.  The ones I believe in always prove true.  This fiat currency/central planning is a good means to fail as we are now.
So, tl/dr.  I am more about economics, than politics.  Seems they have to be tied now.
 I upvoted you and generally agree with your way of thinking, but i have to share a slightly different viewpoint.
&gt; Demand that the rest of world bail them out.
 Things are not always like they seem. The Greek people were never properly presented with the situation at hand and never asked to participate in making a decision. The loan agreement has not even gone through the parliament. (the structural changes memorandum on the other hand has been voted in)
 When our new PM publicly denied thoughts of calling in the IMF, he had already agreed to the bail out, following months of secret talks, as later revealed by IMF director Strauss-Kahn. During all these months Greece was not in a debt crisis yet and was still borrowing from the financial markets. Then, after the new government came into power, we magically lost all ability to borrow with spreads skyrocketing in about a month's time, the speculators having been let loose and fed by "irresponsible public statements" from officials everywhere. And then we entered the IMF/EU deal having been told it had not been on the table before and it was the only way out. Both of which were lies. And our gov had outside help/pressure/whatever to say these lies. (btw, not saying there was necessarily a better way than the bail out, but there were other ways certainly and none were discussed.)
 Also, it is debatable if this is a bail out in the traditional sense. The Greek state will be left in massively more debt after the current memorandum (if it even goes according to plan) and facing a new debt crisis when it tries to borrow from the markets again. And it must have done away with a lot of its key assets, sold for peanuts. How is this helpful? If we're on the virge of defaulting now, how will we avoid it then?
 Anyway i cannot avoid acknowledging all this could and should have been avoided if our decades old stupid policies were kept under check by our people and its government representatives. But guess what? The corruption/stupidity in this system is not limited to Greece. The IMF was in on this, in secret no less. Big EU powers were in full knowledge of how things were being run here for many decades. It was German companies like Siemens that bribed their way into (unsustainable) Greek state contracts over the years (look it up for more info, very well documented cases are out there). 
 Now, once again (part of the) money Greece is getting to fight the crisis will end up back in Germany and France (and who knows where else) to buy warships and submarines. Again someone is making a profit out of misery, prospect of armed clash between Greece and Turkey and whatnot..
 Since i lack the knowledge to go trully in depth i will end my rant with this [nice link of Daniel Cohn-Bendit's view on the issue, from a speech in the EU parliament.](

***  Greeks were not alone in fucking up, although they inevitably are the biggest offenders in this story. Check the link just above for another dimension in the Greek issue.
A brand new prescription, still in the bag. I love the sound the mag makes. I love wondering exactly what kind of bottle I'm going to get...long? Fat? Tiny and stuffed to the brim? White with a red lid? Blue? White? The possibilities are endless. Or maybe a whole new kind of bottle.
So my mom hands it over to me in the car. I curl my fingers under the crinkly paper  bag, yanking upwards and ripping the staple from it's new home. I straighten the bag and rip at the opening again, finally getting rid of the staple, the only thing between me and pill heaven. I reach my hand it, catching a glimpse of florescent orange. Clenching my fist around the fat bottle I remove it, an joy overtakes me. I glance at the clock...perfect, five hours since I've last taken a pill. And perfect, a TacoBell Mountain Dew right next to me in the car coaster. 
I push hard on the stubborn child lock of my pill bottle, twisting aggressively. The lid "pop"s off an I set it in my lap. I very delicately, with my forefinger and thumb, pluck one powdery white mind candy from the bottle. The smell is bitter but I don't care.
I pop the pill beneath my tongue and lift my Mountain Dew to my lips...sipping in, I swallow. I glance at the clock once more and twitch each finger on my left hand once...5,6,7,8,9...at nine I can indulge once more.
I LIKE PILLZZZZZZZZ.  
Tis funny this comic was made, as Baltimore is undergoing a lot of redevelopment. 
For those acquainted with Baltimore, Harbor East is a recently developed high class area. Close to the aquarium and Pier 6 (a popular concert venue; I saw Ben Harper perform there) a Four Seasons hotel is almost finished; and its only appropriate that it's right next to a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.
Also, perhaps in OP's research he learned about [Westport Waterfront]( an eco-friendly waterfront commerical, office, and residential community under construction right next to I-95 as it crosses the Harbor (a hop, skip, and a jump away from Raven's Stadium and Camden Yards). 
 Upvote for Baltimore!
I'll take the inevitable down votes and offer myself up on the alter to defend the logic if anyone has any questions about WTF he's talking about.
It's an issue of [negative rights vs positive rights]( and is not limited to healthcare.
A negative right is one that obliges the inaction of another. For example the right to free speech means another can not stop you from expressing yourself.
A positive right by contrast obliges the action of another. In this case healthcare. A right to healthcare means that someone else is obliged to provide you with a service.
Libertarians of which rand is one (more or less) are fans of negative rights, but obliging one person to do something for another against their will, no matter how noble the goal, violates the right of that person to choose how use their labor.
 it's not just healthcare, you will find that negative rights (and he mentions a few) are viewed negatively by libertarian types because they force one person to give up their negative rights to provide another with their positive rights.
Insofar as this is what Ryan says, he is simply wrong.  
There is no "slavery" here; there is only taxation.  Taxing the general public to provide a service is not slavery.  Slavery occurs when one or a few are conscripted to provide labor for others.  Taxation shares the burden among everyone, and we use tax revenues to provide services that are available for all.  You may have enough wealth to afford private education or to not need food stamps, but they are available for you if you do need them.  
There is a simple question here, and it is entirely obscured by Ryan's ideological, pseudo-academic line-drawing:  What services are important enough to provide to the general public?  That is a policy decision, and one we can answer with the democratic process.  It is a question entirely unsuited for ideological black-and-white answers.  There are no *a priori* principles that say whether a service is important; there is only what we decide together as a society.
Finally, to make my point clearer, there is no meaningful difference between negative and positive rights.  All "rights" imply duties--duties to refrain from doing something or to do something.  But there are no absolute rights.  All rights are exercises in accommodation.  A "negative" right, in your example, says that I cannot stop you from expressing yourself.  But I can!  For the good of society in general, I can stop you from burning crosses in an effort to intimidate others or from yelling fire in the proverbial crowded theater.  Moreover, your "negative" right says that I *cannot* do something, which is no less restrictive than a positive duty to do something.  We accept many positive duties much more readily than negative duties.  There is nothing worse about the duty simply because it is "positive."  (E.g., compare the way we feel about rules requiring us to purchase car insurance, which has a net social benefit, with the way we feel about rules preventing us from shutting up the Westboro Baptists.)  Now I think I've said what I came to say, so I'll stop.
  No, it's actually not slavery.  This is not even a colorable argument.
This is pretty awesome. I was just back home because my mom died, and my dad and I were going through the lockboxes to find documents we needed and we came across an envelope of negatives that he had gotten from his grandmother years ago. They are an odd size, I want to say 2 1/2 inches by 3? Anyways, they came home with my great-grandfather from Normandy, France in WWII. I took them to National Camera and video to have them printed, but they said it would cost me $13 each, and I had 32 of them :/ 
After I got back to the house, I got to thinking about it and for shits and giggles, decided to stick them in the scanner and try photoshop to reverse the negatives to positives (am not very proficient with that yet) Lo and behold, I figured out how to invert them and voila! Instant digital copy of pictures from 1944.
Best part was, my dad knew I was going to try to have them printed, and when he got home I told him how much it was going to cost and saw the disappointment cross his face and then I said "But I figured out how to get them on the computer and put them on your iPad for you." the smile that went across his face made me feel like a very good daughter, indeed.
 found great grandpa's negatives from 1944 in Normandy, and scanned them and made them look right, put them on Dad's iPad. First time seeing him happy in three weeks after my mom died.
I hate onions and fish. I've just always did. My mom recently passed away, and while eating with the rest of my family on Good Friday (the day you're not supposed to eat meat) I reminded my dad about how I didn't like fish.
He went and told me that it was okay, and that my mom didn't like fish as well. I always knew this. What I didn't learn until that day was that because my mom didn't like fish, she wouldn't feed it to me, so since I never really had it, the couple times I did I didn't like it. Same thing with onions, my mom hated them, so I ended up hating them and never put the two together and realized that my mom caused me to not like the foods that I still don't like to this day.
- My mom incepted me and made me hate certain foods
Personally, I like the idea of the Stoner system because it's a modular rifle that can be reconfigured for different purposes.  The engineering is what's attractive to me.  Also, the rarity, of course.  If the Expeditionary Rifle had been as completely Stoner compatible as possible and had had all the cool variation parts available, I would have gotten one.  
I think for most people, the fact that it was only issued in small quantities to elite units adds to the mystique too.
 I have no idea.  I think they are neat :o)
Was just looking through one of my links (ha) in more detail, and this caught my eye for secondary inspection:
&gt;In a head to head trial of the abilities of various antioxidants to prevent glutamate toxicity, cannabidiol was superior to both α-tocopherol and ascorbate in protective capacity. Recent preliminary studies in a rat model of focal cerebral ischaemia suggested that cannabidiol may be at least as effective in vivo as seen in these in vitro studies.
Now I'm no more of an organic chemist than my dog is professional butt inspector, but **does this say that cannabis is a better anti-oxidant than vitamin c**? 
Now think of how many times you've had something sweet and justified its consumption for the vitamin c content.  Well, the next time you're having that sweet glass of Sunny D that says it's 'fortified with vitamin c', you should note to yourself that weed is the superior product for that purpose.
TL/DR:  Orange juice is to vitamin c as cannabis is to a more powerful antioxidant.
&gt; That is very unfair: it means that one rich man can produce far more "speech" in support of his candidate than any poor man. Why should the rich man be given that unfair advantage? Is he wiser? Is he more valuable? Is he a better citizen? Almost certainly not. So why should he have a megaphone, when everyone else doesn't? Especially when the court decision was legally dubious at best?
The rich can also afford more guns. Does that also make the 2nd amendment "unfair?" Freedom of speech doesn't imply that people do or ought to have equal opportunity to deliver speech. It doesn't mean everybody should have his or her own radio station. It doesn't even mean that people must listen to you, or that people can't stop you from delivering speech.
The left doesn't care about freedom of speech, they care about people having the right to freely express, and they define people as individual human beings. 
The problem with this lies within the First Amendment:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the **freedom of speech**".
Congress cannot abridge the freedom of speech. This does not say that Congress cannot violate individual people's right to freely express. It says that *speech*, whether from a person or organization or otherwise, itself is free.
A political ad, whether from the ACLU or a corporation, *is* speech, so it cannot be abridged by Congress.
&gt; Money isn't speech
According to the Supreme Court, even prior to Citizens United, it is.
&gt; Citizens United is directly opposed to your interests
Without Citizens United, Congress would be able to abridge the freedom of speech. That means it is in favor of my interests.
 Liberals don't like the freedom of speech, they like the right to free expression. They think they are the same, but they are not. Freedom of speech grants freedom to speech, not to individuals (although it is an implication).
If you got to about 9:40 then you'll see the ground cinnamon trick. This is a horrible trick to do to someone. The premise is a person cannot swallow a tablespoon of ground cinnamon. It's physically impossible. Here's what happens:
First you put the cinnamon in your mouth and for some reason breath in while you're putting the spoon in. The cinnamon gets sucked into your throat and you let out a little cough. This cough starts a chain reaction that cannot be undone. As cinnamon powder flies from your nose, you start to realize that you have made the worst decision of your life.
You try desperately to swallow as your tongue seems to catch fire from the cinnamon. 
Then you realize that your throat is closing up because the cinnamon is now attached to the back of your tongue, making your gag reflex activate.
As you struggle to swallow what you think is the last of the powder, you realize that the feeling in your throat is familiar. More saliva than usual, nausea, copper mixed with cinnamon... You're about to throw up.
You then run to the nearest liquid, and lots of it. I prefer tap water from a handle-faucet so you can stick the faucet in your mouth and turn on the sprayer.
You think you're in the clear by using water, but for some reason you can't stop swallowing. Each second that passes is excruciating as the cinnamon seems to have become glass shards tearing up your insides. You realize that your Uvula is the worst invention in the world because there's now cinnamon stuck on the backside of it. The thing that makes you vomit is caked in ground cinnamon and your puny water sprayer can't touch it.
After a couple minutes of struggling you begin to vomit. At first it's to get the cinnamon free from your throat, so you just puke up brown mud in small amounts. It's more like dry heaving than anything. As you clean yourself up it continues again. Over and over you clean, feel better for a minute, then puke, then clean, then puke. The torment never stops. 
After some time you feel better because the puking must have washed the backside of your uvula, however disgusting that may seem, it's the most welcome feeling you could ever have. You continue washing your mouth to get the taste out.
Just as you're about back to normal, you think it's ok to swallow some water to dilute the cinnamon in your stomach. This is the worst thing you can do. As a hunk of ground cinnamon washes down and touches your stomach, it's like your organs reject everything you just put them through. The projectile vomiting continues until you've been cleansed.
For the remainder of the night you feel like you've been hit by a truck and your throat feels like you've been sliced open.
- That dude lost a girlfriend that night.
Acidity is a measure of the proton concentration under [Brønsted–Lowry]( or propensity for electron acceptance under [Lewis]( The base metals you mention are excellent electron **donors** in their elemental state (full electron count) because they give up one electron and reduce their valence to the same as a nearby Nobel Gas.
** Li+, Na+, and K+ can create a more stable electronic configuration than H+.**
Sounds to me like the cops are willing to press charges, but of course they cant overlook the fact that your sister was also breaking the law.
you want the guy to learn his lesson, but you don't want your sister to learn hers? 
ICBC isn't going to do much. Your sister is going to be found at fault for both not wearing a helmet, and for driving on the sidewalk.
A bike is considered pretty much a car - Your sister is just as bad riding on the sidewalk, as the guy with the car was.
And sadly, it's his word against hers - She admitted to riding on the sidewalk, and breaking the helmet law, and he hasn't. He could say he asked if she was ok, she said yes, and he went on his way - breaking no laws. 
 your screwed. Take it as a lesson learned... be happy she got away with a few bruises and nothing else. being hit by a car with no helmet, she could be dead right now. 
No, he is right, that is how they trick smart geeks to confess they are asocial, by admitting what you think everybody would admit.
These tests are just like women, you have to think the correct answer and then say the opposite.
You have to be a total hypocrite and dissembler, and act offended if they suggest you lied, act offended like a Swiss banker when you ask him some question.
Yes, No, No, Yes

I'm a very good shot. You do realize that nobody is a "perfect shot" 100% of the time right. Have you ever shot a gun? Even a BB gun? Have you ever target practiced? I happen to find mechanical objects such as guns, catapults, rockets, slingshots interesting which, is why I like guns. It's a something to do. If one-shot guns were an efficient defense we would have never advanced past muzzle loaders. 
What is the difference between 14 and 16 bullets? It's all how you use it that matters. 
50 cent is living proof that one bullet won't always kill you.
Given that Stewart is the one liberal that O'Reilly will have on his show (repeatedly), and is actually somewhat civil towards; as well as the fact that almost every mainstream pundit always tries to say "Jon Stewart needs to admit that he's not just a comedian anymore and actually influences public opinion" tells me that he does have respect.
Add to that the fact that CNN actually used Stewart's criticism of Crossfire as their reasoning for cancelling the show and the fact that after the Kramer/Stewart debate (and later the Rally to Restore Sanity), he was all anyone in the media would talk about. He seems to be taken very seriously internally, then they put on a brave face and act like he's just a jester, so they don't have to admit that he scares them.
 if he wasn't taken seriously, they wouldn't attack him.
I'm a white guy who grew up in an almost entirely white neighborhood.   The first black kids I knew were twins - both girls - who were born in Africa and moved here when they were babies.  They were otherwise "normal" kids but, in fact, they DID smell different.  I can remember the smell and the closest thing I can liken it to is pepper.
Of course I saw other black people but don't remember ever thinking anything of it - I just assumed they smelled like pepper, too.  Then, when I was in the 5th grade my best friend was black - born in America, but his dad was Kenyan.  The first night I stayed at their house, during dinner, I asked how come they didn't smell like pepper.
About 3 minutes of confusing conversation ensued as they tried to figure out wtf I was asking, while I embarrassingly tried to dodge giving them the real answer.  
Eventually, they just changed the subject.  I was so embarrassed and hardly slept at all that night.  I still cringe when I think about it.
- Black people sometimes smell like pepper, but, not usually.
&gt;The ownership of the firearms you describe are completely legal in most states **that aren't in the north east or California**
FTFY
Also - you failed to mention the paperwork, background checks, and absurd fees required before you are legally allowed to own a Class III weapon. If you don't mention that, all the know-nothing anti-gunners will think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can own a FA weapon.

- it requires less paperwork to get into med school than to get an "automatic" weapon.

My point is that if someone attacks me or an innocent person in my presence, I might well have to fire more than 10 shots to stop him. If there are multiple attackers, I might have to shoot each of them multiple times. Even if every shot hits the bad guy in the chest in a way that will eventually kill him, gunshots do not always *stop* a person immediately.
- shooting 20 people is unlikely, but shooting one person 20 times before he stops attacking is more common than you might think
Right-wing political pundits are uptight about Common, a rapper from Chicago who rhymes in a more philosophical and afrocentric standpoint than the rest of commercial rap that "glorifies" violence and sex, being invited to the White House for some type of poet exhibition.
Edit: 
 right wing nuts have panties in a bunch about a black rapper being in the white house.
&gt;I've worked at Mcdonalds, A&amp;W and burger kind (and timmies...  
   
Ah, so you meant those specific places, not "every fast food" place.  Yeah, I would have to agree that those three are the lesser burgers, and I know the first two make use of trays and warmers for sure, I wasn't aware BK did, but I never could stand the smell of the "smoke" flavour they use, even in my teenage years and haven't been in one in ages.  
&gt; calories from fat and calories from protein are the same thing but calories from sugar and calories from carbs can be seperate, ex you can have carbs with no sugar but you can't have sugar with no carbs. Not all sugars are the same and not all calories are the same, defining the "healthy" factor of something is not that simple.   
  
Firstly a calorie is a measurement of energy, not a thing in and of itself.  Your statement means nothing, it's like saying grams from cookies are the same or different as grams from mouse droppings.  A gram is actually a gram, just like a calorie is actually a calorie.  What you are likely trying to say is that the nutrition derived from equal calories can be different, it's just garbled because retarded TV nutritionists spout that lame aphorism and you're reflexively regurgitating it.  Anyway, a protein and a fat are completely different things, your body uses and processes them both differently.  Even their caloric density is different, a gram of fat contains 9 calories and a gram of protein 4 (the same as a gram of carbohydrate).  Your next assertion about sugar vs carbohydrates is equally vapid.  Let's start with "what is [sugar?]( Sugar is a term for a class of edible crystalline **carbohydrates**, mainly sucrose, lactose, and fructose.  All carbohydrates are saccharides, there are 4 types of saccharides, 2 of which are sugars or "simple carbs" and the other two are "complex" like starches and glycogen.  When you eat a starch or a sugar your body mostly converts it to glucose, from there it's either consumed as fuel, stored temporarily as glycogen, or converted to triglycerides and stored as body fat.  I'm not sure why you try to assert that I act as if they're insignificant, I did no such thing, clearly carbs which are converted quickly to blood glucose strain the pancreas, causing the release of too much insulin, sometimes leading to the onset of diabetes.  When I think of people eating their way to blindness, amputation, and living between insulin injections and trips to the dialysis ward, I picture them at Tim's drinking their triple-triple and enjoying that second crueller.  Lord knows the Tim's up the road from me has a much larger rascal driving contingent than any fast food place I've seen, though to be fair, it's partly because Tim's has done a banner job of making themselves to the goto meet-up place for certain demographics like the elderly.  
   
&gt; ..."salad with no dressing" that you assert is a healthy option from Mcdonalds (it' not healthy at all, completely deviod of nutritional content"
  
I see, so you oppose eating vegetables as they're "completely devoid of nutritional content."  Anyway, I was just trying to frame an option as being a healthier option than a double big mac, I don't eat that way, I love meat, personally I find a McDonald's burger patty almost as sad as the slices of factory ham, chicken and pre-cooked bacon at Tim's.  I think Tim's and McDonalds are pretty much equally pathetic, you can buy identical items at both places, so I really don't think your argument is valid.  Both places have the same sad "wraps" and "bacon and egg breakfast sandwiches", Though on that note, at least McDonalds actually cooks their food on premises, you worked at both places, be honest, do you like Tim's boxed pre-cooked eggs more than McDonald's?  Anyway, I really don't believe that even you believe that the chicken salad sandwich at Tim's is somehow "SO much better for you" than the equivalent grilled chicken classic sandwich at McDonald's.  I think you're just one of those gimme-my-Timmies Canadians who has bought into Tim's nationalist propaganda campaign, maybe combined with the fact that you think of a plain sandwich as "home cooking" with some matronly association and therefore somehow more wholesome.  Perhaps when you worked at Tim's you had a more pleasant experience,  I could see that actually, Tim's does seem to have pretty good employee retention, and their employees certainly seem more cheerful on the whole.   
  
All fast food places and most restaurants serve shit food, Tim's included.
A friend of mine posted something on facebook a while back:
&gt;Being 'in love' is merely the spark to start the fire. It takes care and effort to keep the flame alive. Sometimes it will burn brightly, sometimes it will be a mere ember, but a fire can last indefinitely in the right hands. We often get so caught up in sparks that we forget about the flame- the quieter love that lasts.
What you're experiencing is the 'spark', and some people only ever experience sparks because they don't know how to keep their flames lit. As thatguyfred said- take it slow. Take the time to listen and really get to know people. Practice compassion and kindness- these are deep things that must be at the foundation of any relationship, friendship or otherwise. 
Listen, ask questions, be open to what others have to say. You'll be amazed that the 'head over heels' spark dies fast with most people, and you'll be amazed to find depth and passion in people who never had a spark in the first place. 
**** Don't get caught up in the fireworks in the air when there's a deeper story on the ground. 
Must say I disagree with the writer's on several points. Who doesn't like it when Dave screams? He's got one of the best screams in the business. 
Here he says, "...That is what makes “Times Like These,” “Best of You,” and “Walk” stand out over the rest of their catalogue", Umm...bullshit...I do really like the songs he's mentioned but pick anything off the first album and I'll probably have to say its better than the 3 mentioned above. 
To me he sounds like someone who's friend handed them a copy of One By One and hasn't bothered with the previous releases.
Tl:dr, That blogger guy sucks.
Currently I have a Razer Black Widow Ultimate. Same thing as the Black Widow that you are looking at but with more bells `n whistles. I love my keyboard and am very glad I went with this one instead of another Logitech or Microsoft keyboard. However if I would not have gone to the Black Widow I would have been just fine with a Logitech or Microsoft keyboard. 

I would recommend the Black Widow if you had the money to do it. If you don't then you will be just as happy with the others I am sure. A mechanical keyboard is different and at first it might feel a little odd and take a little getting used to but you will most likely end up liking it. If you don't use a mechanical keyboard and you get the X4 or the G110 you will never know what you are missing and therefore you won't regret your decision. 
 If you don't currently know the feel of a Mechanical you won't care that you didn't get the Black Widow. 
That's sort of my point, actually. I'm less complaining about about being ignored (i mean don't get me wrong, i *am* complaining about it, but it's not my main point) than i am arguing that the system is broken. More and more tivo and DVR and itunes sales and the like are becoming popular alternatives to having to wait around to watch a show at a specific date and time. Although not a dominant segment of the market yet, they are becoming increasingly significant. I think i saw on the frontpage just today the fact that Netflix streaming is now officially the largest usage of bandwidth in North America.
So yes, it is logical that advertisers don't care about those demographics and have no motive to support shows that are acquired through means that skip them. But *that in itself* is a problem. Scripted television is moving away from the standard old model where commercials were easy to shoehorn in and difficult to bypass, but the advertising companies aren't moving to catch up. 
When i argue that the ratings system is flawed because it's skipping a large segment of viewers, i'm not just saying that it's bad because those people are ignored. I'm saying it's bad because that group is only getting bigger, and the advertisers doesn't know how to handle the new mediums. 
Under the current model, the bigger the percentage of on-demand viewers gets, the less their tastes are tracked, the less television is made for them, the less they watch, the smaller the population of TV viewers becomes, the less significant that market becomes, the less interest advertisers have in supporting scripted television at all, the less they pay out, the worse television becomes, etc. I may be being an alarmist, but without some sort of new innovation, i can only see this leading to an eventual industry collapse. 
***: just because advertisers' motives make sense, doesn't mean the system *isn't* broken.
*Addendum*: [vaguely relevant article]( that may be of interest.
Very interesting article, one that I completly agree with.
Although I don't deny the importance of metrics in games as a new tool to assist the designer, we need to remember that if we reduce everything to numbers we may very well lose that magical concept called fun.
Some time ago, I implemented metrics in a small private game (a 2d platform with some physics) that I made, where it would register the place where the player died. I gave some copies to friends of mine. I let them play one or two days.
When I looked at the logs, I found they were dying a lot in a small bouncy rectangular platform that would rotate when the player jumped on it. At first I thought that I had made it too hard to pass through that zone, but when I asked them about it they said they were having fun trying to stay on top of the platform and since there was one checkpoint just before that area they didn't mind dying.
 the logs showed a massive amount of deaths in a particular spot. Further investigation found out that it was simply a case of players challenging themselves with something hard to add to the fun.
This is not an argument against metrics, but a tale of warning about them. They can provide extra info, but it's easy to take the wrong conclusions if it's not thorough. 
I am not going to say it was nice but I won't say that person was in the wrong either.
It is his weed, he bought it he can do whatever he wants with it, including smoke it all by himself, share it with friends, or if that person wants to they could share it with everyone.
But the thing is I have gone to parties before where I have loaded a number of bowls to share. This is completely fine if these people are friends and I don't care if they pay me back at some point or they may load a bowl some time that I don't.
However I don't think it should be forced etiquette to share something that you spent money on for someone you have never met before. **If that person offers to put money in I don't see why they should be excluded** because you just don't necessarily know them that well.
    　
****
&gt;are they in the wrong for excluding them or should the two loners just suck it up?
It may be a "dick move" not to share with everyone but it is that person's property and they can do whatever they please with it.
They look similar to us, to other life forms (or even machines) they may be completely different - it's all about mental perception of abstract data.
I'm a fan of this idea - tangentially, it invites a number of thought experiments - do we both even see the same colors?  Do you see the sky as the color that I would call orange?  Since the processing and 'seeing' happens in our brains, how would we ever know?
 idk, but it's fun to think about.
93 - I am guessing that date on Muchas painting is when he did it which is far before Spare's work. Also the hand gestures are not the same, with Mucha's not blocking the airways, aside from the fact that that is an idiosyncratic gesture of Spare's.  Mucha may have had occult influences but this isnt even close to being evidence towards that.
as of my posting others have brought up the massive heat and pressure effects of celestial objects careening through an atmosphere, and the forces gravity would exert on all that excess mass.
I would add that the 'spave atmosphere' would create a drag on objects moving through it, slowing their orbit and precipitating their collision with whatever they may have been orbiting.
 the moon crashes into us, we crash into the sun
Looks like someone is mis-using a float on the back end DB.  I've seen weird math like this when the server fills the unused decimal places with garbage OR uses weird rounding rules.  This is exactly why a lot of databases have currency data types.  
  Some junior DBA is scratching his temple and wondering WTF at the moment.
The computer store I worked at once sold someone a computer and through our own error, forgot to install the modem (late 90's here). They had ordered a network card as well, so somebody goofed on the inspection. We screwed up; Fair enough.
The lady that bought the PC, rather than just bringing it back in for us to install the modem, took it to someone that fancied themselves a tech. He made her buy a new modem for something like a hundred bucks, but he couldn't get the drivers to load. He proceeded to format the drive, reload Windows, and still couldn't do anything.
The lady brings the PC back in finally, livid *at us*, wanting us to pay for the modem she bought, **and** the bill this idiot "tech" gave her for hosing her computer. 
After informing her that she had technically voided her warranty, we loaded up the drivers, got her up and running. I think we refunded her the price of the modem we should have installed, maybe $20.
***: Woman gets mad at computer shop because she took PC to an idiot "tech" who hosed it instead of bringing it in for 5-minute warranty fix.
IN MEDIEVAL MODE?!?  DUDE!  THIS IS SO HUGE!!!?!?!
 **LET'S GET EXCITED ANYWAY!**
:D  It starts.
My best dream, that I will never forget.  I had this dream when I was 16.
My dream starts out with me in a big city.  I was asleep under a big brown leather coat.  It was the middle of the day and I was a vampire.  During the day I posed as a hobo and just slept during the day hours.  At night, however, I was a monster-slaying bad ass!  I had a sword, the ability to fly, and to shoot lighting like a sith master.  Yeah, total bad ass.  Anyway, it turns out that once dormant dragon rose up from the bowels of a nearby lake and I had to fight him.  The dragon was a dark blue sake-like Chinese-styled dragon that summoned lightning storms and shot beams from it's mouth, nothing to be trifled with.  The first encounter with this beast made for a destructive defeat for me.  Sure, I was immortal, but I could harm this foul creature by my normal means of lightning and sword, and only had so much time before the sun rose.  After retreating and taking refuge in a cave to outlast the coming sunrise I took to slumber and was told of an earth golem under control of a powerful sorceress that if defeated, can be crafted into a fine clay sword that is to be the only weakness of this air dragon.  However, the only way to destroy the golem is with the blood of it's creator.  Upon awakening from this, I knew exactly of which sorceress my vision spoke of, for the sorceress was my sister (lol in my dream, it was actually my IRL sister, I thought that was funny when I woke up).  
So anywho, I had to slay my sister, douse the golem with her blood, and forge a blade of clay for which to battle this dragon.  The best part of the dream, is when I fight this dragon.  The battle took place on a stormy night in the sky above the lake.  The clash of claw and steel mimicked by the flash of lightning and the boom of thunder.  The drip of rain and blood made it equally beautiful.  A dream I won't forget. :D
 I was an epic vampire/monster slayer, kill a dragon with a sword made from blood my sorceress sister.  (Kinda weird, TBH.)
I'm a very vivid dreamer and I'm known for telling some pretty ridiculous stories from my dreams, my friends love it. The upside to this is that I have some of the most amazing, epic, and stunning dreams that I can recall well. The downside is that I also have terrifying and crippling nightmares that will haunt me for a few days.
When I was little I used to have recurring nightmares about getting kidnapped/left behind by my mom, or falling. (To this day, I can't even watch someone fall from great heights in a video game without becoming uneasy. The sensation of falling horrifies me.)
After my Grandma died, who I was extremely close to, I had constant nightmares about ghosts and they were extremely vivid. More than once have I had nightmares about being in her apartment and being attacked by ghosts, or sometimes in my own room. Being picked up by an invisible force and thrown around... seeing their faces... stuff like that. In a few of the dreams, I would burn her apartment down because of it. I don't go back to sleep after those dreams.
On the flip side, I have so many cool dreams. I've dreamed about a zombie civilization that, in order to continue living after their bodies decayed, secured mechanical parts for their limbs. They were also avid racers. 
I've had a dream where I was able to morph into a mermaid with one of my friends, and we swam in the ocean, and I swam up next to giant whales and beautiful fish. We found a village on the coast that needed to be rescued from the elements like water, earth, fire etc And I watched as the first element, water, attacked the village. They had these wizard type people that created a giant force field over the village as a giant wave crashed down onto it. I saw it all, it was one of the most breath taking things I've ever experienced. 
I've also had a dream where I was married to an intergalactic Governor of sorts, but I didn't love him and I was having an affair on him with my real life boyfriend at the time. Someone tried to assassinate him, and one of his secret agents saved me. My son was also an intergalactic gangster and I had to use my motherly love to save him. It was crazy, and I got to see space and the planets.
Lastly, I had a dream where I got to play with actual Pokemon. Hehehe.
Because of my nature when it comes to dreams, I learned how to interpret dreams when I was in the 7th grade and have since helped many of my friends with decoding their dreams. (Dream dictionaries are a bunch of bull. Sorry, Freud.)
Dreams are cool.
I often have dreams about nuclear war/end of world scenarios. One time I had a dream that civilization as we know it was ended by nuclear war and I was among the survivors in this new world, where things like infrastructure and technology roughly remained the same but everyone dressed like medieval peasants (I remember getting on the bus that I usually got back when I went to school irl but the windows and seats were made of wood and everyone had swords and bows and arrows) and my city's scenery consisted mainly of forts and castles. Then everything got weird as I had to go with my dad to find supplies or something and we were driving through a dilapidated neighborhood where the victims of my dream's infamous, post-apocalyptic, insane murderer were strewn all over the street but all their heads had been removed and replaced with sewn on, stuffed, cloth heads.

Oh yeah and my best dream was probably when I almost had sex with Courtney Cox in a magic tent in my room.

Medieval post apocalyptic world with cloth-head murderer + Courtney Cox in magic tent.
Worst: A dream that I had when I was in junior high where I was at the starting line of some kind of roller blade race and my mom was trying to convince me from the sidelines not to compete because I was a loser and was just going to fail anyways and this way it would save our family the embarrassment and then woke up to my mom screaming at my dad in an argument about how I was a stupid loser. Great times.
Best: Kind of depressing, too but it was one of those hyper-vivid dreams that really change you. I remember laying back in a chair inside of a shuttle that was about to take off. I was being sent out into space for some reason and I knew that I would never see anybody ever again. At first I was quite terrified by the lift-off itself. I remember I could feel the rumbling as it roared off into space and I was pant-shittingly terrified. I couldn't see anything other than the small cabin I was in that had like three sets of three movie theater seats with me in the middle. Next came the realization when the force against me died and the weightlessness set in (the extreme contrast was hard to notice at first until I observed the seatbelt next to me floating in the weightlessness) that I was never ever coming back to earth. That they had sent me off because they never wanted me to return. That part of the dream was very depressing and I just resolved myself to come to terms with that fact. Next was when a very large window appeared and I could see into the infinite reaches of space. It was extremely vivid and detailed. I can still remember it like I could recall something that actually happened. There was a large green nebulous cloud off in the distance and a long, purple band in front of it that appeared to be a lot closer because I could make out more detail. I could see a wide breadth of stars and one of the last thoughts that went through my head before I woke up was that even though the world was getting rid of me I was at least privileged enough to see and experience things they would never know and that maybe instead of worrying I should just enjoy the beauty of what I have before me. It has had a pretty profound effect on me since then that I can't really explain. I've just been generally happier and better at dealing with some things.
 Blasted off into outerfuckingspace.
I have really bad sleep paralysis bouts. Like, really bad.
So my dreams usually bleed into the real world when I wake up for a bit. Basically I watched the ring when I was about 12 or 13. I didn't find it scary but I've found a lot of nightmares involve a little girl since then so it must have effected me on a subconscious level. Anyways basic story is I'm sitting in my kitchen. And I see a well dressed African guy sitting by my pool staring into it. I walk out and ask him what he's doing and he casually replies, "oh look at the girl."
I look down there's a girl face down at the bottom of my pool, and as soon as I look she starts rising. I look away, again he calmly tells me I need to finish watching. I look back, she's at the bottom again but rising as soon as I look. I tell him no and walk back into my house. I'm in my kitchen and my mother walks over and say's "Oh look, she's out!" I look out and she's floating about 3-4 feet above my pool. She slams into me passing through my wall like a ghost, and then through me. I can't talk in my dream after this and I feel something inside me and no one want's to help me. 
It's at this point I feel my jaw unhinge and her head slowly kinda bobs out and she's staring into my eyes. She starts saying weird stuff (Incantation kind of thing?) and I wake up. I'm sleeping with my then girlfriend at the time. I'm on my back and can't talk or move. I'm trying to scream for her to help me, suddenly an arm grabs me from the side of the bed, I can see the outline of someone wearing a red shirt and a very stretched face SCREAMING "LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME". I lay there paralyzed, I regain control of my body in an instant and fling myself out of bed screaming. 
On an unrelated note, apparently when I'm in sleep paralysis, and my girlfriend does notice. She says I make such shallow harsh breathing noises she think's I'm dying, glances over and sees me with eyes like dinner plates. I told her she's not allowed to wake me up out of these things as last time I lunged at her as I came out.
Yeah, no fun.
 Girl from the ring possess me in my dream, head unhinges my jaw and comes out, I wake up from that nightmare to a bout of sleep paralysis and someone screaming at me and pinning my arms.
Last night's dream was particularly bad: I was riding in a car full of co-workers, I couldn't hold it and I shit my pants. Not only that, but somehow I managed to get it all over the white upholstery of the car, it was everywhere. I was literally crying and wondering how I would ever go on. I woke up as I was sobbing and contemplating moving out of state.
 Worst dream ever.
I have super bizarre dreams all the time. One of my favorites was the night after I first saw Inception.
I (female) met some D&amp;D nerds at a park. They were gathered around a table working on some kind of campaign. Apparently, these guys could go into the campaign, Inception style. I befriended one of them and he took me with him into the game.
The first level was just an office building where all the guys had offices and equipment to help them design the actual game, which was another level below them. My friend was some sort of artist who designed the textures of the game. His older brother was the leader of the group, and most of the other guys were friends of the older brother. My friend said he had to take care of something in the game, and offered to take me down another level with him.
In the game, we had all kinds of fun exploring and battling the Big Bad (who looked a lot like Strong Sad from Homestar Runner..). One interesting feature of the game was that everyone could turn into a dog. My friend turned into a very cute dog with a shiny red-and-white coat. He would turn into the dog at various points in the game, which allowed him to solve certain puzzles, etc.
At some point, my friend revealed to me that he had a more serious agenda in the game. Apparently, he had a greenhouse where he was cultivating living plants. His brother and the other guys weren't terribly interested in these plants, but my friend thought they were vitally important, because actual life could only be created within the context of the game, and not from the upper levels. I don't know why it was so crucial to have living plants in the game, but the point is that it was Important and my friend needed my help taking care of them.
We went to the greenhouse and tended to the plants for a while. My friend had done a good job and it would soon be time to transplant them into other parts of the game map. But then, the older brother and his friends appeared. They were dressed like something out of Lord of the Flies and they all had evil grins on their faces. My friend sort of bristled and I still had no idea what was going on.
The older brother goaded my friend about his stupid plants and threatened to destroy them. He and his creepy friends started loudly discussing various ways to trash the greenhouse and ruin my friend's work. My friend asked them, in an eerily calm voice, to stop. He said he'd give them what they wanted if they left the greenhouse alone, and then he turned into the dog.
The older brother and his friends all stopped laughing and fixated on the dog. Suddenly they were all making creepy, lewd comments about my friend. The older brother went and picked up the dog and stroked his neck, commenting on his beautiful coat. And then he turned the dog around and started fucking him.
I watched, hiding at this point, as the entire group of guys took turns fucking my friend, who changed a few times between human and dog form, depending on each guy's preference. They all commented on his beautiful red-and-white coat and stroked his soft neck when he was a dog. When he was a human, they commented on his soft skin and blond hair and sweet ass. He barely made a sound the whole time. This was not at all exciting--it was horrifying to watch.
My understanding was that while my friend was trying to create an actual game and cultivate life within it, these guys were just using it as a big sex playground. My friend, apparently the choicest piece of ass in the group, had learned to trade sex for the privilege of maintaining his greenhouse in peace.
I forced myself to wake up before the guys were all finished. I was too disturbed to stick around. I felt extremely weird for the rest of the day.
** I went two levels deep in an Inception-style D&amp;D game, where I watched a friend of mine get raped, in dog form, by his older brother and friends. The whole game turned out to be an incest/bestiality sex extortion conspiracy.
This isn't even the weirdest dream I've had.
I used to have this nightmare at least 3-4 days a week. I've had a lot of oral surgeries including implants and braces, and at first I thought that was what was triggering the dreams. After getting my teeth all fixed up I was still having the dreams and I was confused more than ever. 
The dreams than got more intense. It began as losing or wiggling teeth, but now I was in awkward social situations as well. Making out with a girl and my teeth falling out is a good example. 
Around the same time I began working out and eating healthy. As my body began to look better and I felt healthier, the dreams stopped. I don't remember the last time I had one...
 Maybe it's a self esteem/how you think you look issue.
Most recently, I dreamed my brother killed my mother and successfully made it appear to be a suicide. I was the only one who knew it wasn't, and no one believed me. And then, her life insurance policy was null and void because it was through the Lutheran church and they basically told me that if they could confirm she was in hell, she was in violation of her policy and I, the beneficiary, would have to figure out some other way to pay off all of her debts.... it was so weird.
 my mom killed my brother and left me in an emotional and financial hell.
When I am in a happy place in my life, I have these reccurring dreams of me running.
I am running and running and my strides get wider and wider, and before I know it, I'm leaping and jumping over stuff like I'm light as a feather.  I leap and go so far that I get to the point that I pass the clouds and the rush of coming back down from the jump is so exhilarating.
I rarely remember it when I wake up, but throughout the day I'm in a really good mood and I get a flutter in my heart exactly like the one that I get when coming down from a leap looking down at the world rushing towards back at me.
tl dr: I dream LIKE A BOSS
I can never remember my best dreams. I guess what's why I enjoy the happy ones so much... I wouldn't be able to thoroughly enjoy them if I couldn't easily remember the bad ones, anyway...
I like to think of this reoccurring dream as an apocalyptic nightmare I've been having since about the time I was 8. Yes, I still have it on occasion.
The sky is a bloody, orange-red color. It sounds like the sky is falling, and my little brother and I have been abandoned. I have no idea where my parents are (I'm much younger in this dream, perhaps about 5 or 6), and the world looks like someone set fire to it. There are little patches of blue sky poking through the backdrop of the aforementioned color. Something starts chasing us. All these years, I've never figured out what it is. I'm much shorter in my dream, so short, in fact that I can't see over the dashboard of an old 4Runner my parents used to have... but I'm trying to drive it, and pieces of the blue sky are falling down in front of me. I hear tires screeching, and eventually we crash into a ditch... but that's always when I've woken up. It's a lot scarier in the dream than it sounds when I explain it... I'm always soaked due to perspiring profusely, too.
-- apocalyptic dream, I can never remember seeing other people in aside from my brother and I.
I rarely remember my dreams, and the ones I do remember are just slightly cohesive, but illogical scenes and images - like a David Lynch film, for lack of a better description. But about seven or eight years ago, I had a nightmare that has haunted me to this day.  
In the dream, I woke up from sleep and walked quickly to the bathroom. My nose was full of blackheads, pimples, and crazy acne. I grabbed a razor blade and slowly sliced the flesh off of my nose. There was minimal bleeding, if any. My nose came off in one piece, but the dirt and grime were still on what was left of my nose. I wiped it off. I looked down at what I sliced off and rinsed it under the faucet. It was like a flesh colored piece of rubber with a cluster of holes, like a lotus pod plant. It disgusted me, so I put it in my mouth and ate it. 
I then woke up feeling sick to my stomach (but my nose was intact!), and I couldn't fall back asleep. Very quickly after, I developed a severe case of trypophobia that still bugs the hell out of me. 
** I cut off my nose to spite my face, now clusters of holes make me want to vomit**

Aliens.... I had the most realist dream I could not wake up from about the stupid aliens movie.. Started off "Space" related... and when it was getting intense I realized I was asleep and woke up.. to find that they were in my house and I had to protect my family... The after waking up in the dream was so damn real... I "KNEW" it had to be still part of the dream but I "KNEW" I had woken up... anyway the dream ended horrific.. and I finally woke up at 3am and stayed up the rest of the night. Ugh.. 
: Inception type nightmare involving the creatures from Alien.
Sadly no "Best" as I 99/100 of the times do not remember having any dreams unless they are bad enough to wake me up.
This is going to sound weird and bullshit-y but I swear it's true - every once in a while, I have a dream where I talk to a dead person. I think it's my unconscious mind's way of coming to terms with the fact that they're gone. They differ subtly - the first one was a dream of my friend who died in a car accident. We were having a normal conversation, and the part I remember most clearly is me saying to her "Why don't you just come back? We miss you." and her responding "You know that I can't do that. It doesn't work that way. But it's okay. Jacob [her son, who died in the accident also] and I are okay." 
The second one was of my friend who committed suicide. That's been two dreams - the first one was just a brief dream of me yelling at him, the usual "how could you do this to us?" sort of thing. The last dream was last night. We were talking and catching up; we both said how much we missed each other, he said he "didn't know it would be like this" and then, in the wtf way of dreams, said that maybe someday he could come back and we'd go see Louis CK together like we'd talked about. This one was tough, because it was really vivid. But before it ended, we both acknowledged that we knew he couldn't. 
The last one was actually between the two dreams of the second friend. My grandma, who I wasn't terribly close with, passed away and I dreamt that I was watching her at a dinner party, only she was younger - her hair was brown and her skin was smooth. She was animated, and talking and didn't seem to see me, but I recall thinking to myself "Ok, she's happy and settled in here. I can go now." 
I don't think that I talk to ghosts because I don't believe in ghosts. I certainly don't believe in an afterlife. IMO, this is just how my brain deals with death, something I have trouble comprehending the enormity of - especially sudden deaths (both my friends were young when they died, my grandma's illness was short). The dreams are more comforting than sad because, with the exception of my grandma, the people in them know that they're dead, and so do I. So it's not like I wake up thinking they're alive - they know they're not, I know they're not, I'm just sort of checking in anyway. That's probably the most interesting dream I've had, except the one with the zombie invasion and the super-fast, super-lethal blue eyed cannibals. 
 Maybe I talk to ghosts. 
Worst: I wake up to find my parents have left and me and my friends are the only ones left in our town. We wander around, find out that its some sort of experiment. There's a tornado just over the top of my street and we decide to walk down to see whats going on, as its not a natural tornado (I live in Wales, we don't really have tornadoes...) . We get to a street that we used to walk down every day to go to school, and the tornado is on top of  the roof, so we go in and we find just an lcd TV on the wall, but all the furnature is gone. We look at the tv and there's this ape like thing, that's too big to be an ape, and much scarier. It was properly horrifying. Then we hear cars outside and we all hide in a drywall where there's a hole. We watch as the military come in, big american accents disaster movie military. The leader guy is gnarled and smoking a cigarette, the works. 'Let's see if this baby works.' He shouts and all the soldiers cheer, then they shoot the tv with some sort of ray, and out pops the horror that had just been staring at us.
The general tries to calm it down but he can't and it tears a few of his men apart. Blood starts seeping through the drywall, and the soldiers retreat. We all stay as quiet as we can, hoping it will leave, but then one of my old friends sneezes and it starts thrashing at the drywall. 
Its arm comes through and seperates us in to two groups, and we run one way they run another. We get out in to the street and just start running towards our school. A soldier sees us and starts chasing us, and he shoots at us and hits on of my friends. I pulled out a gun and killed him, but then the gun was gone. We went back and took his, because I didn't have one anymore, and just before we leave we hear on his radio, 'The experiment was a complete failure. They're all awake. Get back to the wall.' 
So we figure the wall is a safe zone and we need to get there. We start walking along the train tracks to the nearest city, Cardiff, and this passes really quickly. Our other friends catch us up, and we all run up to the road to approach the wall. The wall is this massive structure with a tiny door, and we're all running towards it. The door opens and someone is waving their arms shouting 'over here, you're almost there!' 
Then we hear engines behind us and the army guys are back, shooting at us. I stop and turn around and they shoot me in the stomach with something that isn't a bullet. It's more like an electrified grapple hook. It goes through my stomach and the other ends are sticking out of my back. They also shoot my friend in the leg. All of our other friends rush back, and they go to her instead, bending down and fussing over her and trying to carry her to safety. No one comes to me.
I felt completely hopeless. and the guy just sort of smiles at me and points his gun right at my head. Before he can shoot me another one of those ape things appears and picks him up, and I'm just left on the floor, watching it and crying as all my friends hobble to safety, ignoring me asking them to come back and help.
They were kind of dicks in real life too. 
 Horror movie esque dream portrayed my friends as cunts who I couldn't rely on. Turns out that's exactly what they were. 
And I can't think of a best dream off the top of my head. 
I dreamed once that I was driving along a lonely country road, and in the distance I could see a large (like, 100 foot) tree. As I got closer I saw that every branch had a person hanging from it. Dead, of course. When I got there I started taking down the bodies to bury them, and they all got up and walked away.
 I plucked a Zombie Tree.
Ok... definitely the most bizarre dream I've ever had.  I have lucid dreams every couple months, but this just goes beyond strange on so many levels.  This was a multi-stage dream with 2 levels (yes, exactly like inception- also happens, though not as commonly.)  
  I don't remember much about the first level, except that I was trying to visit a friend's school.  They didn't let me in, and for some reason I ran away being chased by a bunch of children through the forest who were trying to kill me (or something).  For some reason I fell asleep in the middle of the woods.
  This is where my second level dream started, and things started getting odd on a surreal level.  I was standing in some dark courtyard with some other generic people at night, and there were some incredibly low flying, fast moving clouds.  Some of them lowered into the courtyard and started to glow orange, and form strange shapes.  I took out my iphone to try and take a picture of it, but every time I tried to slide to my home page the screen would snap back, refusing to let me get to my camera.  
  This was pretty frustrating, and around the time I started to realize I was dreaming.  I thought about how I had gotten there, and remembered falling asleep in the forest (this trick from Inception actually has allowed me to have more lucid dreams).  Interestingly I didn't realize that THAT was a dream, so I was having a lucid dream inside a regular dream.
  The truly bizarre part came next, and is hard to describe.  I knew I was dreaming, that it was a weird lucid dream, so I knew when I woke up I was probably going to end up telling someone about it, so I wanted to absorb and remember all the details I could.  I was still looking at my phone, and noticed that the camera app didn't say 'camera'.  I had trouble focusing on it, it was straining my eyes, but eventually saw that the title was just a bunch of random letters and numbers.  I remember thinking "wow, my subconscious is SO uncreative that it can't even make up a name for this?".  I tried to read and memorize what the name was anyway (so I could tell people about it later), but the numbers and letters started changing randomly in front of my eyes.  This pissed me off, and I woke up completely- though somewhat surprised and confused that I was in my bed and not a forest.  
  
- I had a lucid dream inside a normal dream where my uncreative subconscious trolled me.
When I was about five or so, maybe six years old, I remember having a dream where my family and I were driving along this main road. It was just a normal road, nothing weird, until we start seeing the outlines of three crosses in the distance. All of a sudden, my mom turns around and tells me, "That's where they're filming the new movie about Jesus." I look up, and see my dad in the middle cross, playing the role of Jesus on the cross.
Woke up screaming.
***, I think my dreams predicted the Passion of the Christ when I was 5 or 6.
A few weeks ago, I dreamed I was being attacked by a pair of birds on my friend's porch.   I swatted them away, but eventually had to stop them by reaching out lightning-quick and catching one by the neck.  On closer inspection, the top of their heads had ridges like a bottle-top.  I twisted it.  It popped off, and the bird went stiff.  looking through the hole in it's skull, I could see that I was now holding a stiff, hollow, bird-shaped receptacle, full of some kind of drinkable juice.  I was too scared to drink it.  Then I threw it down and did the same check with the other one.  Same story.  Hollow, juice-filled bird.  Bottlecap for a skull.  
I was distraught by this, so I woke up, stumbled to the computer and got on Wikipedia.  Researching this particular phenomenon, I was shocked to learn that scientists have indeed developed a chemical, called Enzyme-219 which, if present in the tissue of a living thing, upon death acts to begin an immediate liquefaction of the muscle, organ, and bone tissue, and with such speed that the existing glucose contained in the cell walls does not have time to ferment.  The result?  Kill an animal, and you can drink it.  Like a pulpy, salty protein-based juice.  I was particularly shocked to find that pharmaceutical companies are eyeing this chemical as a potential sale for animal control in various states (think, no more roadkill messes, just puddles) and will potentially screw over entire ecosystems in their rash adoption.
And *then* I woke up.  For real.  Took me about 8 hours to get over this one.
*** Inception'd myself with a realistic and relevant dream-wikipedia search, forcing me to believe the contents of *prior dream*.
I quit after 5 years.  I thought about it for a long time, and just committed to being done one day.  It was hard because I was in college and ALL of my friends smoked, so it seemed like i was missing out.  I got over it, though. I let myself have one every once in awhile - it usually leaves me feeling and smelling disgusting, and serves as a nice reminder of why I quit.
I have several friends who say they want to quit, and they'll blast a whole "final" pack, get two days in, and give up.  I never understood it.  Sure, it unpleasant - but if you want to quit, that's all you have to do - STOP SMOKING THE FUCKING THINGS.  every time you want to, DON'T. and you've quit.  it's that simple!  I think my "i want to but i can't" friends just don't have the resolve, and they just make excuses.  It's as simple as deciding to quit and suffering the temporary consequences.
Here's my question:  Have you noticed, like me, that the vast majority of people going to the welfare/food stamp office seem to always smell like giant walking ashtrays?  I really think that smoking should disqualify you from programs like welfare, or any financial aid that is need-based.  If you can afford to chain smoke at $5/pack, you can afford to buy food.
am I right or what?

&gt; ...without a clear definition of bias. That makes it laughably easy for participants to conflate loss of white privilege with an actual societal bias against whites.
I saw that as a big part of the results of the study (even if not explicitly stated as such).  You're absolutely right - it IS laughably easy for (some) people to conflate lost off white privilege with actual bias (against them).
Maybe I'm reading to much into articles like this one (and a couple others), but I think that's the REAL story here... That more whites *think* there's more "anti-white" bias, than the same size sample of blacks (and their thinking about "anti-black" bias).
Given a technical example/definition of bias before asking people their opinions about this would only taint (some of) the sample into thinking somewhat more rationally, and (arguably) skew the data (akin to "leading the witness").
**** Yeah, a lot of this is semantics, but that's kind of the point of what the results turned out to reveal.
Why is it that when I dream, it's only death? Since the time I was a young child, that's all I've ever dreamt of. The earliest dream (Recurring) I can remember was when I was two years old [I still slept in a crib at the time] and the dream was that in the middle of the night, suddenly the house would start shaking. And as the house shook, I would rise in my crib and look out the window to see a Tyrannosaurus Rex walking through my neighborhoods backyards. I would hear the creak of the door behind me, and turn around just in time to see two Jurassic Park-esque Raptors charging me. One would head butt me into the back of the crib, then dig into my stomach and just as the second's jaws snapped down on my face, I would wake up. Each time this dream repeated itself, it would be slightly different, but always the raptors came, and always I died. But I was aware that this had, "happened before", and each time I would try hiding, running, anything I could do to avoid death, but each and every time it ended with me being a gory mess.
The next series of dreams that continued to reoccur started when I was 4, and it always started off with me on a slide in one of my favorite water parks of the time. It was one of those actual slides, the big plastic round twisting and turning ones? I would be going down this slide, but slowly it would dawn on me that I had been on the slide too long, that I couldn't see the bottom and the top had long since disappeared. The water would get thinner and thinner as I slid down further, until eventually it stopped entirely and I was just sliding on the dampness of my own swimtrunks. Then the slide would take one of those plunges, those almost straight down ones you see at water parks, but since there was no water, I never stayed upright. My foot or my leg or something would catch, and I would begin to tumble, eventually falling off the slide and to my death as I finally reached the cement bottom of this Hellish attraction. Again, each time it happened I would be aware that I had been in a similar experience before, and I would try new, different forms and styles to try and avoid snagging, but always it would eventually happen...
This goes on and on the rest of my life, every six months or so now the type of dream switches out, and right around the time I turned 13, the dreams switched so it wasn't just me dying, but everyone around me, too. Usually by my own fault. 
I've never been able to figure out why these dreams occur or why I can't dream of anything but death, but I'm 18 now, and still experiencing these.
The most recent dream involves me driving a metro bus, filled to every seat with my most beloved family and friends. Suddenly while I'm going downhill, I realize I'm supposed to take THIS TURN, the one I'm currently passing, and I try to jerk the wheel to the right to make it. But the bus is too heavy and instead of turning, it flips, and rolls down the hill. Since I'm the driver, I'm buckled in, but I can hear the screams and crying of those in the back being tossed around the inside of this rolling death trap. The bus eventually comes to a stop and I crawl out of the wreckage, bleeding from hundreds of places but it doesn't matter, because I can see the bodies of everyone i've ever loved littered around me, blood pooling or smeared around them on the concrete. Eventually I stop looking for survivors and just sit there, silent, looking at what I had done, until suddenly I feel like I've been punched in the stomach, hard. I look down and see a new pool of blood forming on my shirt and just now the sound of the gunfire actually registers to my brain, and I realize I'd been shot. I look in the direction it came from, and walking towards me with a handgun pointed at my chest is my best friend, limping on a broken ankle it looks like, and covered in more cuts and bruises than anyone else I had seen. The look in his eyes is pure vengeance, the only reason he's still alive is to exact his revenge on me, and I know this from but a single glance into his ice blue eyes. I look up at him, and whisper a soft, "I'm sorry" before he pulls the trigger three more times, each bullet finding it's mark in my heart.
 I always die in my dreams, why?
Some seven years ago now, I must have been 17, I got to go to the CERN facility as a school field trip during holidays, which meant that only those who really wanted would go because you had to give up your holiday. It was me, some of my friends from high school and a dozen other nerds.
Now I encountered lots of mysteries there but none pertaining to my own life. What I did find there was a book. One of my friends dabbled in philosophy back then, so much so that he recently acquired his masters in philosophy and is currently working on his Ph.D in philosophy. 
But seven years back he brought a book with him "The History of Greek Philosophy" by Luciano De Crescenzo, translated from Italian to Dutch (since we're both Belgian). I started reading the book but before I got to finish it the trip was over. He probably offered to lend it to me but I declined for some reason. 
Fastforward a couple of months, summer holidays were almost over and my mom asks me to get the mail. A thing I hardly ever did at that time. The smart people among you probably guessed that someone had put that book I was reading in my mail box. And indeed, someone did, without a note or anything. And to this day I have no clue who put it there. It was a different edition than my friend's and he denies having to do anything with it (I figure he would have told me now after seven years but he still denies). 
He was the only person who knew I wanted to read it so I can't think of anyone else who would give me that book. At the time I kind of felt like Sophie from the book ["Sophie's World"]( 
I still have that book in my bookcase now and I still don't know who gave it to me. 
 I read a friend's book on philosophy without finishing it and found it in my mailbox months later while my friend denies having put it there.
Most ads are measured in 1000s and you usually buy per 1000. Your CPM is the going rate for 1000 impressions (Cost-per-mille). Now CPMs can usually run from 50 cents to 5 dollars depending on where you want your ad shown and how targeted you want it to be. In addition you can usually put qualifiers such as only show between these hours or use them all by this date. So for a week, you can buy say 1000 ads and have it distributed along the week. 
There is also another metric to buy ads and thats CPC (cost per click), its usually in addition to a CPM in order to bump up your priority. The only place I've seen it used by itself is on facebook.
Opinion: I would approach this from a business (small business) stand point of I want to spend $5 a week on ads, and doing a little math with the CPM or if the site your advertising on is accommodating, you can get any where from 1000 - 10000 ads a week.
 You pay per thousand ads usually in the 50 cent - $5 range. This varies by site and how much you target. 
Minimum you **should** spend : 50 cents 
Maximum you **should** spend: $5
I didn't mean to come of as insulting or offensive. I shouldn't have laughed; I just found it funny you knew enough about density, and how temperature affects density, to be unaware of the major determining factor in if something will float or not.
Your average rock sinks because it weighs more than the water it displaces. Because a rock is usually solid, all it needs to do is be heavier than water.
What makes this pool not sink is the fact that it is NOT solid - in fact, it is almost exclusively compromised of air. It's about a foot and a half deep, right? Think about what would happen if you pushed the pool down 1.4 feet. It would be displacing a lot of water, but 99% of what is in place of the water is just air. To find the volume of a cylinder, the formula is pi * r * r * h. So, 3.14159 * 2.2 * 2.2 * 1.5 = 22.8 cubic feet. So, if you push the pool down to it's rim, you would be displacing 22.8 cubic feet of water. A cubic foot of water weighs about 60 pounds. 22.8 * 60 = 1368 pounds.
So, to sink the pool, you need to put roughly 1368 pounds of stuff into the pool.
Now, imagine you put a hole in the bottom of the pool. It now no longer has the ability to contain the air. Because of  this, the 22.8 cubic feet of displacement is gone, and you are only really displacing maybe 0.8 cubic feet of material - just the plastic pool itself. Now the pool only needs to weigh 50 pounds to sink. This is where the density of the plastic itself and the temperature of the water come into play - the pool as pictures would probably sink if it had a hole it it, but just barely. If it was made out of lead (high density material), and had a hole it it, you could expect it to sink like a rock. If it was made of a closed cell foam (low density material), you could expect it to float.
Now, to put all this is more real world terms, this is why both a 40 pound canoe and a 100,000? ton aircraft carrier can float - they both displace more water than they weigh. They displace lots of water, and replace all that displaced water with nearly weightless air. If you poke a hole in them though, and make it impossible for them to hold on to their air, they sink.
 Air is really light and a boat shaped object uses that air to float.
Those are some interesting statistics you've got there, but to address the meat of your post, I'd say it's because in general, people love sensationalism, and enjoy further exacerbating their "us versus them" mentalities.
confirmation bias all up in this bitch.
It is, but I understand it.
The Dutch are getting fucking sick and tired of dumbass American/British pot tourists fucking up their shit. Residents of the main districts had been lobbying against legalization since its beginnings for this reason. The people get really high and really drunk and start messing stuff up. Frankly, if the internationals can't respect the locals while partaking in their bounty they don't deserve to be there.
I'm Canadian, and I'd be arguing for the same legislation if Toronto or somewhere became a pot tourist destination.
a bunch of idiots ruined it for everyone else.
Uh, hey guy, I've had someone break in to my house. The cops are useless for break ins, and admitted it freely when they came to take their report. I've also had people use my front yard as a parking lot and tear the hell out of it, which turns out to be legal according to the police. I've been pulled over and cited for a law that, surprise, doesn't exist, and only found out after sending in my not guilty plea and getting a letter from a very confused courts clerk.
 where do you live? I want to live in this perfect 1950's utopia where the police don't bust small time smokers and dealers and actually do something about crime.
Ugh, this fucking pisses me off so bad...my gf &amp; I moved a year ago to a different state where we don't know anyone at all and we still have yet to meet any like-minded people in the area, as we're not exactly the most social creatures.
We finally figured why not try messaging ents and seeing if they're open to hanging out when we see someone post about being in the area? So far we had found two; one was about to move and the other was too paranoid (with good reason, it seems). Fuck the drug war in the ass.

No you still need a hood if you are doing anything besides steaming.  The hood traps grease so that the fire suppressant system can work all in one place.  If you try to open a place with just induction burners and you start frying bacon on them and you don't have a hood the health department will be like fuck you that's a fire hazard. There is equipment - a flat top with a built in intake vent and haacp filter for teppanyaki and a pimped out convection oven with infrared and microwave that you can program that also has a haacp filter and these also have their own built in fire suppressant systems for when self destruct mode is neccessary.
also mine doesn't do temperature increments fine enough for candies but you probably have some baller equipment at school that you'll never see again once you actually start working in the industry.
what are they teaching you in school?
Here's what she has to say, hope you find it illuminating:
BitterOldPunk thinks that my perspective, as a lefty Canadian who's been living in Birmingham for the last couple of years, might be helpful, so I've been thinking about what to say about Alabama. The more I think about it, the more nebulous it all gets. The thing is, like anywhere else in the world, Alabama is varied and layered and filled with so many differences -- regional, cultural, individual -- that it's impossible to sum up in a few sentences. (That makes it sound like some kind of dessert confection, which is appropriate, since AL is indeed filled with delicious food that will probably kill you. These folks take their food seriously.) All that follows is with the caveat that I haven't spent much time in rural AL, though I have seen some of it, and so can't really talk about what people are like there, except that the ones I've met have all been warm and friendly and helpful.
Is there racism here? Sure. But the 60s and 70s are far behind us, and frankly, I've seen worse racism and similar income disparity between whites and natives in Canada. In urban areas, I'd say the Canadian income disparity is worse. The people I've met here, both black and white, are honest about the racist history of Alabama and are not shy about calling racism out when they see it. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is a monument to this approach. (Link:  Maybe I've been lucky in the friends I've made; everyone's different. Is the Civil War still an issue? Sure, for some. In my experience, it's brought up a lot more by non-Southerners (including some of my Canadian friends), usually in the form of pointing at the South and saying, "They just won't let go," thus perpetuating the stereotype. Is it Jesus country? Oh, hell yes. You will come across dry counties and areas where no liquor is served on Sundays; Christianity comes up a lot both in the media and in private conversations; and there are more churches here than I've seen anywhere. It's irritating for me, coming from a much more secular society, when Christianity governs so much of public life. That said, the Christians I've met have not been pushy about it, and haven't treated me differently for being a 3rd generation agnostic, and though I know a couple still hope that I'll be saved, that's just because they like me. Is it conservative? Yes. Way more so than I'm comfortable with. I try to avoid talking politics here, because I start to froth at the mouth. However, not everyone is conservative, just more people than I'm used to, and some people I didn't expect to be.
Where Canadians are polite, the Southerners I've met have been warm. Friendly. Even more polite. In my experience, Southerners take two things seriously -- food and football -- and as for the rest, if it's good, enjoy it; if it's bad, laugh about it, and then do something about it. And then tell stories about it, preferably funny ones. Because there are some seriously funny people walking around here. Things move more slowly here, too. Don't expect to go through a check-out without a conversation. In fact, don't expect to do anything that involves interacting with another human being without there being some conversation. Don't expect things to be done right freaking now, because that's just not how things are done here. 
This has turned into a big and I could go on for several more paragraphs, but that's because I'm still wrapping my mind around what Alabama's all about, and my experiences only relate to the people *I've* met and the places *I've* been, and Alabama is anything but homogenous. In fact, I've learned lots about what it's not, but I could live here my whole life (and would be happy to do so), and still have only scratched the surface of what it is. It's different from Canada in many ways, some obvious and some surprisingly subtle, but I like it. You should come down and check it out for yourself.
I am originally from south Florida, but most people I encounter in Alabama consider me a Northerner. I don't understand that. Having moved here about 4 years ago, there are many good and bad things about the state. 
The biggest negative to me is in the extreme influence of Christianity on everything. People assume you are a Christian and get offended when you are not. I do agree with VyseofArcadia that it is difficult to get a job/promotion unless you know someone, and specifically if you know them from church. I work at a university, and even here where people seem more liberal than the surrounding areas, I rarely see anyone hired that doesn't know someone else through church. Thankfully, my mother-in-law works here, so I was able to get a job. I also agree with his/her statement that people tend to pray for things that action would be more appropriate. The recent tornadoes have devastated many communities in my area, and people with pray for the families and what not, but rarely do they actually do anything. 
There are many racist people here. I here people talk badly about interracial couples. But, to be fair, I lived in Brooklyn before moving here, and people were just as racist up there. Many people here have negative opinions about people from the North, which includes me. They think my voice is very snobby sounding simply because I do not have the Southern accent. 
The stereotype of southern hospitality is somewhat true. People will talk to you, wave at you, and generally are nice to you even if they do not know you. But, they will also talk badly about you behind your back, and then just say "bless his/her heart" like that erases all the horrible stuff they just said. 
They do love BBQ and Mexican food here, but hate Mexicans (this included all Hispanic/Spanish people, even if they are not actually Mexican at all). Guns are a very big deal to many people, but they do seem to hunt here often, so I can understand it. 
From what I have seen, people are severely undereducated compared to where I have lived before this. They do not seem to have a firm grasp on the English language or know any basic facts about history and science. Like I said previously, I work at a university, and you would think the students would know these things, but that is very untrue. I am constantly surprised at how many of my students speak and write. 
They seem to listen to pop music here, just like anywhere else in America. I haven't noticed really any significant difference in music tastes, other than love of country music, which I think is getting more and more popular in America as a whole. 
The best thing about Alabama, to me, is the pace of life and the cost of everything. People are significantly less rushed and all the food and housing is so much cheaper. You wage will be lower, but I feel like I can buy more now than I ever could. Property taxes are ridiculously low, but this has an impact on our schools.
My biggest annoyance with Alabama (other than the religion thing) is how people present themselves in public. I am not saying you have to look super nice everywhere you go, but people where pajama pants out to the store (and by the store, I mean Walmart, because that is all you are getting in most places.) You'll see dirty little children with just diapers on running around stores. People walk around without shoes or shirts on or just look generally dirty. I understand that when you have a manual labor job, you get dirty and need to go to the store, but I am not talking about people like that. I know this sounds snooty, but it really bothers me. 
Also, people are very hypocritical. They will talk badly about someone doing something, but then do the same thing. For example, with the recent tornadoes, FEMA has been giving out food stamps to most people that apply, even if you had no damage. A woman that I see at work asked me if I had gotten them, and I said that I hadn't because I had only lost power for 12 hours and had no damage to my home. She told me I can get them anyhow, it doesn't matter if I actually need them. This is a person who had previously discussed with me how she thinks people that abuse welfare/disability are just awful people. 
 From what I have seen, Alabama is very much like the stereotypes. 

When I was 16, driving down the I-95 in Iowa, we passed an old 50's era pickup truck.  It was in perfect condition, except it was overturned.
As drive by, my dad notices that the interior light is still on inside the truck...  
Now my dad is a firefighter, and he knows that when the emergency response arrives to a crash, they pull the battery, to shut everything off... so he KNOWS that this isn't some old abandoned truck, this is a RECENT accident!
He flips out and pulls over yelling at us that the lights are still on, he's backing up on the shoulder of the road, middle of the day, cars and transport trucks racing by us...  He gets out of the vehicle, and runs down towards the truck.  
I got out of the car, and my mom called 911.  I ran out to help my dad, as he crawled inside the cab of the truck.  He said there is no one in there, but the windshield is smashed, and he found one shoe.
If someone left the scene of the crash, they would have taken there shoes he told me... we had to start searching...
The next bit is a blur, but I was walking through some tall grass near a fence and a tree, and almost stepped on him...
there was a man with one shoe laying there... his back on the ground, but his head was in the mud.  I screamed, my dad ran... he said he was dead and moved me away from him...
by then other cars that had pulled over after seeing that we had, and the police arrived.   I was questioned and returned to the car.  
About a month later we got a call from police near the accident in Iowa... They said his name was Noel Casey, and it had been raining the night before.  He must have lost control, and because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, he was launched 100ft and was killed upon impacting the tree.   

** I found a dead body, he would still be alive if he wore his seatbelt**
Edit: cutting my story down... was way too long
Well it all started when Larry Ellison bought Sun, who was the major contributor to OpenOffice.
Then [this]( happened.
Then Larry said, "No way, you Open Source hippies, screw you and the horse you rode in on.  I'm keeping the OpenOffice name, [and I'm closing it down]( Ironic, right brah?  Oh did I forget to say 'Problem?'"
Then pretty much everybody else on the planet who cared said, "Is that so, Larry? Keep your name, we're keeping the software and keeping it open. You can go clean the goat cheese out of your scraggly beard."
[This article explains it more eloquently.](
  Open Source Software:  one of the best concepts man has ever created.  OK LibreOffice maybe not so much -- but software oligarchs and their meaty-little-fingered bumblings don't stand a chance.
Edit:  edits.
It took me a long time to date someone. After many years of waiting for other people to ask me out, I started asking them out. Now I girlfriend. :)
- don't wait for them to ask you out.
I'm a smart and cute guy. I am also a jerk. If the girl is not very fit, I'm not interested, even if she is a perfect match for what I'm interested in apart from that. Many / most attractive guys feel like this, and girls seem to not really understand, maybe because it's not universal, and rarely mentioned.

Do we need to start making  for rage comics?
Two stories, I'll start with the second chronicalogically. First time back from Thanksgiving (I think) last year, my friends and I go to smoke some incredibly dank buds out of my friend's new bubbler. We get to one of our usual sketchy ass spots, I'm third in rotation and hit Señor Bubs. I am overcome with a feeling I've never experienced and just blasted the still reasonably packed bowl all over the grass. Was awful :(
Second story was related but still pretty bad. I must have seemed like the worst newb ever when I didn't explain correctly how much 'baccy I usually use. I said use about a quarter as much as the weed. I forgot to mention that I meant by weight because about three times around the circle I excused myself from the Gazeebo and puked all over the bushes in the surrounding Arboretum. That was the only occasion that I've thrown up from smoking wherein I was neither really drunk nor had eaten a huge meal before smoking.
 Don't eat McDonalds before smoking a blunt in the backseat of your friend's car. So many paper towels (it's a different story, read the originals)
I have to say, I'm pretty disgusted by the level of ignorance in a lot of these comments -- particularly those badmouthing this woman in particular for buying the purse in the first place. 
First off, it's beyond silly to generalize all women. All women don't love buying $700 bags, and all men don't want to buy $700 rims. It's pretty inaccurate/insulting to make blanket statements about either. 
Second off, knockoffs and 'real' bags are **not** at all the same. I've owned plenty of knockoffs of a variety of brands (including Coach) as well as a variety of 'real' bags (also including Coach), and the real ones are CONSISTENTLY better quality items that are not only more appealing visually, but they hold up for MUCH, much longer. In the long term, a 'real' bag almost always ends up saving you money (due to the increased longevity of the bag), as well as resources, as you're not just buying a cheap bag and tossing it in a landfill after 2 months of use.  (And yes, there *are* notable visual differences  to real versus knockoffs -- most women who are into this sort of thing can tell the difference instantly.) So generally, it's a better choice financially and environmentally. 
Additionally, in general, the 'real' bags are from far more traceable origins. You can usually find out where the bag comes from, where the materials are sourced, and where it's made. That isn't to say that some of them don't come from nasty sweatshops in China, but usually with the real ones, you have the option to research the conditions they're manufactured in, and decide whether to buy one or not based on that fact. With knockoffs, you can **never** know for sure, and it's usually safe to assume that they weren't manufactured in favorable (or at least not offensive) conditions. The price of knockoffs are [generally] cheaper for a reason. 
Thirdly, I won't try to justify $700 for this particular bag, as I know nothing about it, but the specific price isn't really the question here any way. The only important thing here, for argument's sake, is that it's a big number for the majority of us to shell out at any given time..
Simply put, people can spend money on whatever the fuck they want. Maybe you'd choose to spend that money on some fancy new graphics card, or to donate it to a needing charity, or on a fucking bedazzled toilet -- it doesn't really matter. People have the right to spend their money as they please without your criticism. It just comes down to what people value. If she values a $700 purse over $700 spent on something else, then that's what she values. Maybe she sees your suggestions as equally warped. Granted, obviously it may be more practical to spend the money on only necessities, but most of us are guilty of spending money on luxury items anyway, in one form or another. (Luxury here meaning not entirely necessary for everyday life.) 
 They aren't the same. There's a lot about buying a real bag that usually makes it more economical and more environmentally / worker-friendly. That, and who are you to judge how she, or any one else spends? You've probably done it, too. 
I owned a knock off-coach bag which lasted less than six months. I have had two bona-fide Coach bags for the past five years. I have not bought another purse since. Buy a timeless style that you'll use for years to come and it is well worth it. The quality of stitching is MUCH better. I used to buy other name brand bags but NONE have come close to the quality of my Coach bags.  However I still wouldn't pay $700 for a bag; Coach doesn't have to be expensive, I bought one at the factory store for less than $60 and the other one was under $200. 
 Coach can be worth it because they make quality products
In some professions, driving a BMW or similar luxury car is an asset.  Fields like Real Estate, Architecture, Interior Design are basically you selling yourself.  How are you supposed to inspire confidence in a new client that you can meet their needs and give them what they want if you project 'frugal' in their mind versus 'class'; 'opulence'; 'Italian' or whatever else they are looking for?   If you live in a 800 sq.ft. apartment, how are you equipped to address the needs of a client trying to furnish/design/remodel a 12,000 sq.ft. guest house?  Not saying you can't - but the immediate image from a client would be, how?   I question how millionaire politicians can possibly know how to best serve the needs of the poor - they have no context.   Same thing.
 Driving a BMW may very well be more profitable versus driving a Corolla in certain fields.
Now, I have no idea what that bag would look like or is made from, but it could very conceivably be made from &gt;$50 worth of leather.  That said, I am guessing that they are mass produced purses of cheap quality, and can't possibly be worth more than $100.
Given the nature of women's fashion, that bag will likely only be used for a year, maybe two before the next fashionable thing comes along. Along the same lines, your fancy $700 graphics card (which doesn't have $500 worth of material, the processes are the cost) is still going to be good next year, but will only perform at the range of the lower high-end video card of the next generation (Which costs ~$300), are you going to go buy the latest and greatest?  It makes far more sense for me to buy 2 $200 cards (hell, my $180 GTX460 has run every game I've thrown at it at near maxed settings) that match the performance and then just upgrade them in a year or two.
Now, if that graphics card lasted 10 years? Then go right ahead and spend $700 on it. Then said, I wouldn't see an issue if a girl spends $700 on a purse that she will use for a decade or more.
Spending that much money for the "better" product only makes sense if it lasts longer.
Possibly relevant: My girlfriend was given a Louis Vuitton wallet from her stepmom and she wasn't sure it was real. I called up the Louis Vuitton headquarters to ask about this and apparently its a frequently asked question. The answer that was given to me was that there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to tell the difference between a phony and real product. This might be a different case for other brands such as gucci and coach. 
 Buy the cheap ones because it's impossible to tell the difference. 
My point was that most women have very reasonable priorities when buying things and even if they could afford a $700 purse, they know that they can buy *a lot* of other stuff with that amount of money. Some women might go and buy a $700 purse but that's definitely not the majority. Although, if I won the lottery or something, I might just go and buy some ridiculously expensive things but, still, a purse wouldn't be the first one on the list.
 A lot of other stuff &gt; one purse
I rarely see people using ACTUAL cursive to write their signature. It's mostly all quick scribble now and the people who actually do write out their full name in cursive from what I have seen are females with awful spelling skills which shouldn't be related in any way.
Majority of people who write their full name are girls in my opinion.
I'm young and think I'm right as well.  The environmental thing, I think is debatable, especially depending on where you get your meat.  If I eat part of a cow that was born and raised a block away from my house and I picked up it from the farmer, are you really going to tell me I had more of an environmental impact by eating that than I did say a mango imported from Bangladesh, which was kept fresh with pesticides, shipped to America on a plane and most likely stored in a cool house/warehouse for weeks or months before it gets to me?
Furthermore, I think I am under no moral obligation not to eat meat.  YES-- the process by which we raise and slaughter animals on a large scale in the US is not morally right because they're not treated well, and I should strive to come above this system by supporting free range and local farms, etc.  But if you say I'm morally at fault for eating meat, I think you're wrong.  See every other animal species that ever existed that eats meat.  But yes, I can see how it's bad for the animal.  [Unfortunately, that's how nature works.](
And bad for me?  I think that's debatable.  Anything in moderation is fine, and it probably depends on what you're eating and where it's from.
**TL; DR**  I'm a self-righteous omnivore.  I hope I didn't offend you.
Fire as you see it (flames, etc.) Is just hot waste (ash and gasses) being produced by the exothermic reaction going on.  When an object is really hot, it glows red (releases red light), and shifts towards white (metal heats in this way).  The difference is the gasses aren't visible, but they still release light similarily to how solids do.  This is why gasses that are very hot will make "flames" which is red light less concentrated (hence it seems see-through in parts).  A solid bar of metal is solid and has many more atoms producing red light, until it's so hot it reflects all light and glows white.  Few things will glow red, because when exciting their atoms, it will change their state (water), or will combust them (wood, gasoline, plants, etc.)
Some materials will release non-red light upon combustion, which is why some chemicals glow green, blue or purple when combusting.  This isn't due to excited atoms or heat, because some of the reactions create so little heat you can put your hand in them longer than normal and not burn yourself.  Normal heating of an atom will always produce red-white light.
When something gets really hot, it begins to reflect red/orange light, the hotter it gets, the more it reflects yellow light, and at some point it will reflect all light (white).  Because it's gaseous when released (CO2, H2O), it will seem less dense then extremely hot metal.
Did you report that as income?  You know governments inherently have the right to know about and regulate all of your activities.  If they might be considered income-generating it is of course proper for them to charge you a tax on those activities.  If you can't see why this is obviously a citizen's duty to our great nation then you are a traitorous thief that deserves to be locked up with the mother killers and father rapists.
And no, there are no exceptions for scale of any given activity unless your total income is much less than it would take to feed, clothe and house yourself.  That would mean a reduction in the amount of information the government has on you which is clearly not in the government's best interests.

I am Slovenian and I can tell you this is a very sensationalist title and completely untrue. College students over here rely heavily on carpooling and most use a very popular website, prevoz.org, to find others to carpool with. A few days ago, the administrators of said website received a message from a disgruntled user, who was allegedly fined (for "providing transport services without a license") by an undercover tax inspector. In fear of more users experiencing the same thing, prevoz.org was temporarily shut down. The Tax Administration has since stated that their records show no such event happening and have issued an investigation into it. Additionally, they stated they won't prosecute anybody for carpooling and prevoz.org is now back online.
**** Nothing was outlawed.
anecdotal evidence: i'm in the process from going from fattie boom boom to in shape. probably about 2/3 done at this point. it's like night and day, my friend. it has become *too easy* to get dates, etc. i find myself having to force myself into dating in a league i had only ever dreamed of before. i've had new girls i've met gush about how hot and how "brawny" i am.
- despite you trying to convince yourself that you're ok just the way you are, girls care and they care big time, whether they consciously are aware of it or not.
What on earth is wrong with people's responses to this? The responses of redditors in these comments is racist and pathetic. Have a heart and understand the politics of the area are not cut and dry or simple to resolve. Also understand we (international community) should be doing more to protect the people in the country from violence and intimidation. The situation has been boiling for years but now is the time to make a difference in that country. 
The same can be said for Bahrain, which has just been given a F1 Grand Prix for later in the year. To go into Libya and effectively try to force regime change but ignore and blatantly support other regimes is disgraceful hypocrisy. This is a story about humanity that needs attention, constant attention.
Redditors are saying moronic things and the international community is not doing enough.
A few weeks ago, a 12 year old atheist girl brought home a permission slip for the Fort Bragg Garrison Chaplain’s annual Vacation Bible School.
It turns out that many of our members are familiar with VBS products. Apparently, there are a few companies that launch new VBS packages every couple of years. This year, parents who sign the permission slip from the Fort Bragg schools are signing their children up for the PandaMania VBS package.
***2Kings 2:23-24 (NIV)***
*23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” 24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. **Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.** 25 And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.*

So, I just played my first 5 games of Ranked (with almost the same stats as you, 340 wins, ~ that in losses), and surprisingly, went 4-1. Surprisingly(you've no clue how hard it is to spell that after taking a bong hit. unless you do.), because although I consider myself above average, i expected 3-2 tops.
As I did expect, I "cost" my team 1 game, being so under-fed with Garen I'd just stumble into the middle of a fight and bleed. Long story, but I wasn't the only cause, our Udyr was also about as worthless as a Ken doll.
With that said, if you read up on strategy and follow most of it, you won't be a detriment to your team. WARNING: My first game, I was highest elo/banmaster. I froze, and missed a ban. Couldn't find Shen. Only get half the champs to choose from? Maybe. 
Other than that, I picked a champ I was comfortable with when I was first(once a tank, we Rocked Solid), played Soraka 'cause I figured no one else would(didn't see a single other the other 4 games, other than Nidalee. Others!) and again won. Complete the team is a good way to go, unless you have a Main.
Hm... last hitting is... harder. I didn't break 100 in any of the games, which lasted about the same amount of time. I truly sucked with Garen/Trynd vs. Nidalee/Teemo. We chased them to their tower, they chased us back to ours. I did my regen thing, he did his, we charged back into the fray. Epic, we came out on top, 7/5/8 with 41 CS in 34 minutes.
Not much warding outside 1 game, and myself a spot here and there. It really just felt tighter, ya know? You step into someone's radius, they're in your grill, better able to get the free shots.
Had one rager when I had the bad game, 1/5/1 or shit. He flipped it around death 3-4. But Zilean was behind me the whole time, only used his ult once. Another small bean on the Teammate side of things.
I can picture already counter-picking become a fun part of the game.
Hm. With all that said...
TL;DR
Same time of player, same situation, went for Ranked.
Your worst fears will be realized at some point. Deal with it.
Make sure you know the interface.
Have fun.
This whole debate just proves to me that MMA needs an official system of statistics to keep count of the number of take downs, the number of submission attempts, versus the number of effective strikes/ effective submission attempts.
IMHO, all of these techniques should get points...if somebody gets taken down in real life on the street the person on the bottom is effectively the loser.  They are at a serious disadvantage.  Same thing with an average strike...you get hit with an elbow or a knee... the fight is over.  If an average joe gets caught in any type of submission, the fight is going to be over too.
Of course, the real issue is how exciting the fights are.  It's hard to sell wrestling and lay n pray... no matter how effective they are. Think of it this way: if a police officer were to lay and pray against a criminal that would have a significant advantage... so why shouldn't this tactic be rewarded as well?
 everything... every marital art move should count... if you can control a guy so he can't hurt you during a fight, you should get points for that.
wow, not one of you understands exchange rates?
example:
in the US you make $1200 a month and pay $3 for a pack of cigarettes
in the EU you make 1200€ a month and pay 3€ for a pack of cigarettes
it means: if you make money in the US and spend it in the EU you change currency and pay more because of the exchange rate
it doesnt mean: some people will pay more for sony's new toy than others
clear? ok good.
one other thing...
if you live in the EU and buy a Sony toy from the US you will spend less money (currently the € has a higher value than $) but it would mean that you'd have to buy all your games from the US as well to work on your US machine (unless you haXor that shit, i guess) but you'll probably pay for it in shipping anyway
exchange rates have nothing to do with pricing of internationally sold products
 
Not knowing Dave I couldn't say for sure.
It could be totally harmless and he just enjoys your (and Jeff's) friendship.
Or he has issues and somehow sees this as garnering "points" with you, hoping that your relationship with Jeff turns sour so he can jump back in.
Does Dave seem like the crazy type? Is he seeing someone else?
*** Totally plausible that Dave is just being a nice friend but I doubt it, only you can know.
Is "rich" or "wealth" a good metric for power corrupt? For example, the Fed is a corrosive tool even if it screwed everyone equally. The people that benefit are not necessarily he problem either, it is the system that is tolerated due to ignorance. This is why the Great Leap Forward was such a disaster.
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

I got into technology when I was a kid and always wanted to work in that field. When I was in high school I started working with the schools tech staff during the summer running wires, updating computers, etc. After I got out of school I got a job as a tech and took classes at night. After working in the field you start to build up contacts and build a reputation for yourself which gives you opportunities to advance. After about 6 years I got to where I am at now.
Stay in school, have experience and contacts, get job. =)
It depends on the pill you're using. For maximum effectiveness, take within the three hour window. 
For most combination pills, you can take the pill up to twelve hours late and it is not considered missed-- however, it does slightly lower the effectiveness.
 Take your pill as routinely as you possibly can. 
The difference in reputation of your university will remain important.  Some people considering you for hire/promotion will care and some will not.  For getting a basic entry-level programmer job at a local company if they are just looking for someone who can (or can be quickly trained to) cut them some code they need cut, it may not make much initial difference.  If a company expects more from their entry hires, and is looking for evidence of all-round potential and evidence that you are generally a "smart guy", they may prefer the more prestigious institution.  If they are looking for entry level hires who are promotable and will grow a career with the firm, they will also probably reward the more competitive degree. It may come into play later in your career when you are competing for jobs and/or promotion to more senior positions, especially if you go beyond the strictly technical realm (product management, say).
 
  If the choice is yours to make, for goodness sake go to UCL. Don't undersell yourself. 
A friend of mine wrote a blog post about his experience: [Here](  RCOS at my school is a way to work on open source projects for credit or pay.
 As long as your have a BA, no.  In his experience, the only thing the interviewers were interested in were the big projects he did outside of class.
Assuming you didn't leave anything important out, it wasn't even reasonable for you to invade his privacy in the first place let alone continue being suspicious and to start spying on him.
Taking into account your admittance that you do in fact trust him, it's pretty obvious that you're just incredibly jealous that he's spending so much time with a friend. If you're honestly considering ending a year and a half long relationship for that reason alone you might as well go ahead and do it; you'll both probably be better off in the long run. He can find someone that won't want to throw their relationship away for nothing and you can find someone that you actually care about enough to not considering leaving for stupid reasons.
*** Yes, you're overreacting. A lot.
I don't always downvote, but when I do it's for anything that promotes unsafe driving.
Yes, I realize that I sound like a grumpy old person on a soapbox, but i find unsafe driving unconscionable. I'm sure you've heard this all before, but you have no idea how many people to putting in danger for such a cheap little thrill. I find it absurdly selfish and inconsiderate to others.
I'm not saying risky behavior is bad, I think it spices up life. It is unacceptable, however, to place others at risk if they do not consent to it. If you want to get you're adrenaline going take up rock climbing or mountain biking. In that way, everyone involved understands and accepts the risk. As opposed to fellow commuters who are just trying to get home.

I still remember Canada Post going on strike every year just before Christmas when I was a kid.
I still remember getting a Christmas card that had been opened, the $20 my grandma sent me removed, and a replacement CP money order for $18 placed inside instead ($2 money order fee).
I still remember Canada Post (and it's union) claiming that since they held the monopoly on mail in the country, every single email sent was required to have an electronic "stamp" on it, purchased from Canada Post. They almost succeeded in destroying the internet in Canada.
Frankly, I hope this strike is successful - successful in destroying this POS, outdated monopoly.
The management and union deserve each other - in hell.
 Canada Post and it's union can die in a fire for all I care. Yes, I'm bitter.
While similar, these are two different types of douchebags. The comic you linked is about a breed of douchebag that doesn't expect downvotes and bitches when he inevitably receives them. This comic is about douchebags trying to whore for karma by tricking the hivemind into believing they are independent thinkers. 
*** They're similar but different.
Take from www.erowid.org (with spelling corrections made):
"Overdose: 
(from PDR 1998's amphetamine prescription information)
Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncrasy at dosages as low as 2 mg, they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions, yet doses of 400 to 500 mg are not necessarily fatal. In rats, the oral LD50 of dextroamphetamine sulfate is 96.8 mg/kg."
The average weight of a rat is ~500g, or .5kg (~1.1 lb), so perhaps 48.4kg administered to a rat would 50% of rats exposed to that amount (LD50). 
Assuming the same dose/weight ratio for humans, a 150 lb (~68kg) male would have to take ~6582.4 mg to have a 50% shot at dying. This is also assuming you're administering pure dextroamphetamine orally, which has a bioavailability in the average human of at least over 75%; this means you'd actually have to take more than 6582.4mg to reach that LD50 dose.
One might argue that there are different and increased risks with chronic use and since this is more than likely, there are studies being conducted into the negative long term effects.
- You're well below the LD50 dose. Just be smart: If you're prescribed it and you're taking extra, then you're going to have days where you have less of your 'scrip to take when you should be taking it; if you're taking it recreationally, listen to your body (heart rate, temperature level, amount of sweating, and expected physical activity while under the influence) before you go overboard.
Amphetamine Treatment Similar to That Used in the Treatment of Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Damages Dopaminergic Nerve Endings in the Striatum of Adult Nonhuman Primates

George A. Ricaurte, Annis O. Mechan, Jie Yuan, George Hatzidimitriou, Tao Xie, Andrew H. Mayne, and Una D. McCann Department of Neurology (G.A.R., A.O.M., J.Y., G.H., T.X., A.H.M.) and Psychiatry (U.D.M.), The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland


ABSTRACT: Pharmacotherapy with amphetamine is effective in the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), now recognized in adults as well as in children and adolescents. Here we demonstrate that amphetamine treatment, similar to that used clinically for adult ADHD, damages dopaminergic nerve endings in the striatum of adult nonhuman primates. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of amphetamine associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in nonhuman primates are on the order of those reported in young patients receiving amphetamine for the management of ADHD. These findings may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of ADHD. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to evaluate the dopaminergic neurotoxic potential of therapeutic doses of amphetamine in children as well as adults.

It's definitely colder in the mountains than denver.  I was in Walden today and came back over I-70.  There's still an unseasonable amount of snow for this time of year, the pond at a-basin was just now forming on sunday (I guess they still had 99 inches) and it was still chilly above mid mountain.  It *is* June though, so things were slushy and "mashed potatoey" on a lot of the mountain.
Quite good for this time of year, but yeah, we're almost half way through june :)
Glad you asked.  Here's how beer is made:
First, a wort is brewed.  Wort is basically a tea made from malted grains like barley or wheat.  The grains are mixed with water at high temperatures (generally 150 to 160 degrees Farenheit) and steeped in a vessel called a mash tun for various periods of time...say, an hour or so.  
The resulting wort is sparged into a boil kettle (sparging filters the grains out), and a boil volume is collected by adding hot water through the mash tun into the kettle.  The wort is a sweet tasting liquid.  Then the wort is boiled, and most of the time this is where hops are added (hops are a bitter flower added for their preservative qualities and to counteract the sweetness of the malted grains).  After the wort has sufficiently boiled down, the wort is cooled, transferred to a fermentation vessel, and the yeast is added.
This is where the wort transforms into beer.  Yeast is a tiny animal that metabolizes the sugar and transforms the wort sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.  Once the yeast has eaten its way through the food supply, the cells die off or go into dormancy, and crash out of the beer, forming a yeast cake at the bottom of the fermenting vessel.  Their waste products, namely alcohol, are left in the beer along with the uneaten malted sugars, which give the beer its taste.
Beer is then bottled or kegged, and carbon dioxide is added either by forcing it into the beer or adding extra sugar.  The yeast cells that remain in suspension will eat the extra sugar and carbonate the beer.
As for the taste, there are many different factors: types of grains, water profiles, lengths of time boiled, timing and type of hop additions, amount of hops, length of time fermented, etc.  
The result is hundreds of beer styles and billions of recipes, any one of which could taste good or bad, depending on your tastes. 
As to why you didn't like it when you were a kid, I'm no doctor, but I think kids generally prefer sweeter foods and drinks, and tend to shy away from bitter stuff.  I tried a beer when I was about 8 years old and hated it.  When I got to high school  I grimaced my way through a few months of keystone and coors and in college my tastes were refined, and by now I'm a goddamned beer snob.  I guess it really is an acquired taste.  I have friends who say they've always liked beer but for me at least it took some getting used to.  But I love it too.  I brew it.  You should too!  The best beer you'll ever taste is the stuff you create yourself.
**edit**  Fun fact: hops (humulus) is closely related to cannabis!
*** make tea with grain.  boil.  yeast: nomnomnom...wait...BEER!
There hasn't necessarily been "more" attacks than before. The same amount of malicious activity has been happening. Just now with the political sector concerned about it (read Net Neutrality), they are making sure that it gets reported more. It helps support their claims that the web is the new wild west and must be tamed. Unfortunately most people don't understand what they are really supporting. Safer is always good right?
Another issue is that with a down economy, companies take less risks. They are much less willig to spend money on "unnecessary" upgrades. From the very basics of business/ accounting school you learn that you must match your expenses with the revenue they help to create. IT gets very difficult for this in most companies because they are entirely an expense. Very few IT departments create revenue for a company and are therefore seen as a drain. With exception to a very small number of companies, most CFOs (the ones who sign off on the new purchase orders) do not like IT because its an expense with no obvious R.O.I.
With companies risking less on upgrading their IT infrastructure, you get stuck with increasingly older systems. The older a system gets, the more opportunity for its flaws to be discovered and exploited. A retailer I worked for (in 2010 mind you) has nearly all their core support running on DOS based systems - meaning they are roughly 15 years out of date (flat out archaic in tech years). The longer a company waits to upgrade, the harder it is. With technology advancing so fast, the baby steps and relatively minor system upgrades turn into IT overhauls. Its like going from a Honda Civic to NASCAR stock car.
Making them less likely to take the risk.
Meaning the security holes that have been there are still there, because they havent upgraded to the version of the OS, hardware, firmware, etc... that fixes that.
The reason why many of the attacks seem to be aimed at the government? As stated by "fundraiser":
&gt;government organizations are on average 10 years behind, mainly because they are leery in adapting new technology that hasn't been "tested" yet.
**companies are less likely to upgrade their systems in a crappy economy (more "risky" than in a good economy) leaving more time for hackers to find and exploit the old flaws.**
Financially this has plenty of potential with all the shirt sales. Realistically, do we really need him with all the midfielders that we have, especially since we just bought Henderson? If we do get him, it feels as if he'll only be here for a few years, sells lots of shirts for us in Japan, and then go off to a Spanish club. 
good investment but rather not
There were certainly issues, many stemming from the game misinterpreting your intentions. In particular disagree with evidence you chose or not knowing that you can figure some things out without every piece of evidence.
However i enjoyed it immensely.
It was an incredibly unique experience both in regards to gameplay and storyline. 
It was interesting having a protagonist who is revealed to just be a man trying to do the best he can, neither a benevolent hero or traitorous monster, just a man with human failings.
As for the linear gameplay, i can see how it would be necessary in a game that dependent on story (though branching storylines could have been possible). It did grate at times but (for me at least) that was more than balanced by a sense of satisfaction at figuring out key plot points myself or nailing every aspect of a case.
Flawed but well worth playing for its originality.
Dude, do you really want to bust your balls and only get 4 hours of sleep every night to see your kids a few hours a day in a hostile environment?
I'd rather pay child support and fucking skip out on that shit. You can spend more time with your kids under visitation rules AND have to work less. And get bitched at less.
 Fuck that bitch.
We had similar problems with my son while trying to get him down; we would rock him to sleep, then try to put him down in his crib...this worked great until he was about 9 months (he's about 16 months now), when he would wake up every time we lowered him into his crib.  I have been told this was because his inner-ear was more developed and he would wake up because he was experiencing the sense of falling.  Rough nights during this time;something had to give.  We turned to Ferber as a potential answer...and haven't looked back.  
I was the "administrator" of the Ferber, since it's very tough on the mothers to not go in and pick their child up.  After following the recommended schedule (starting on Friday night), he finally went down without a peep after 5 nights.  Since then, he actually reaches for his crib while being lowered, snuggles up with his blanket, and we walk out of the room and enjoy silence for the rest of the night!  It was tough to get to that point, but the rewards are definitely worth it.  My suggestion is to not "give in" and pick him up.  If you're not familiar with the method, let me know if you want more specifics on how we did it.
Ferber can be tough during teething.  For this, we also give him the tylenol before bed, but also rub orajel in the sensitive parts for additional help.
One other tip I can offer is try to eliminate the bottle step before bed...maybe do bottle, bath, bed?  One reason is that he may become too dependent on that bottle to help him to get to sleep.  Further, I have been told by my dentist that giving a baby milk before bed can cause dental issues, since the lactose in the milk sits on their teeth all night.  If you do keep the bottle before bed, maybe try to stick with water.
You're not alone - it's tough to start and break habits both.  Just be strong and consistent, you'll get there.  Hope this helps!
- we use a dinner, bath, story, bed routine and went with the Ferber Method and have had mostly 7 months of nightly silence.
Is there a training line at the jumpers, preferably tables? That'd would be the ideal place to start. 
I've been messing around on dirt jumps for a little bit now and the one thing I would say is that you need to try and practice boosting as much as possible. I got frustrated trying to learn to boost and ended up just forgetting about it and pedalling like mad to get over everything which was fine for the easy line. However as soon as I started trying to hit the bigger jumps I found it really difficult as my body wasn't in the correct position for the landing. It actually took a day where my chain snapped and I was forced to try and boost everything before I actually got the hang of things.
 follow behind someone good so you know the correct speed into the jumps even it seems really slow so that you can learn to boost them.
This is an interesting strawman you have constructed.
Your average family does not purchase brand new personal SUVs for 'everyone over the driving age' , they do not purchase fancy 'designed clothes' for everyone. Very few people have 'a flat screen in every room'. 
This constructs the 50's as some sort of perfect utopia where people lived a simple life. But people still had luxeries back then, people still bought things. Instead of TVs and iPods it was radios. Instead of fancy SUVs it was fancy bikes. They DID have 4 bedroom, 2 bath houses. In 1950 the average cost of a house was around 8 to 9k and the average income was around 3.5k. In short a house cost about 2.5 to 3 years worth of salary. A new car? That would be around 1.5k. Today the average cost of a house in 2007 was 190k. The national media income for 2006? 44.3k. 
- costs have gone up, earning have stagnated or gone down.
Yes they did. They bought houses they couldn't afford and took out loans way beyond what is good. Everyone knows that debt is bad right. Everyone knows that to be financially secure is to take on as little debt as possible. Guess not, people are dumb and signed a loan that the bank told them they could afford. Next time, don't trust the banks. They want to lend you as much money as legally possible. With relaxed loan rules and congress promoting home ownership, this house of cards fell. 
 People are dumb and cause market bubbles.
Early in their career, the enormous success of the Beatles launched the British Invasion and transformed American pop music. Has Bieber launched a similar "YouTube Invasion" and transformed American pop music? (No.)
Over the course of their career, the Beatles' popularity endured for more than a decade and they used that popularity to repeatedly revolutionize the music industry by pushing the envelope. (These were both artistic revolutions and business revolutions.) Will Bieber do the same? Probably not. (Although if he does, more power to him.)
Bieber is crazy popular right now. And, like the Beatles, that popularity is resulting in a ton of negative backlash. But there have been lots of crazy popular musical acts in the past 40 years. For Bieber's popularity to compare to the Beatles, it's going to need to endure.
**A real comparison won't be possible until 2016.**
I almost know your position exactly, wow.
You say your family is really close, so at least you have that. Why does your sister not approve of him? Just because he is older and from the internet? Your sister knows him, so letting her know that you are serious and she needs to support you is the best plan. It'll probably also help with your parents. 
Telling your parents is going to hurt them, probably, and it's going to make them doubt their trust in you /temporarily/. They will recover, because they love you, and they want you to be happy, and you have been their child for 18 years, and they have to be able to trust you at this point. Soon you won't even be living with them anymore, will you?
When I told my mother about my LD, internet boyfriend (6 years older than me (18/24) and all the way across the world), I was terrified. I have had problems with stalkers on the internet in the past, and my mother freaked out and thought this would be no different.
But what helped was that I kept calm about it, I told her that I really wanted her to know, but that I was going to be in this relationship regardless of what she did, and that I was happy with it. My boyfriend wrote her a letter basically explaining his intentions, his interest in me, and that he was not a creeper. Ask yours to do the same?
You do not have to tell them immediately that you gave him your number. You can tell them this later; it does not have to be all at once. You will probably be asked and will have to tell them that you have seen each other, especially that you have seen him, Skyped with him, and know he is who he says he is.
I think that having this guy so close will help you. You will be able to see him fairly easily. Perhaps your parents would be okay with his coming to visit you all there, so they can be sure he is not going to kidnap you? That is how my mother felt about it. 
Leave yourself open to what they say, and be as calm about it as possible. Let them know that you know this man, and you are interested in him. Do you think he would be willing to let them talk to him? Offer them the chance. If they turn it down, that is their choice, but it shows that you are being open. 
If you must, tell them that you do not want to choose between them and him, and they should not be forcing you to do that anyway. Chances are, things will turn out better than you expect. You just need to stay calm and let them know that you're really trying to do something on your own here.
Or you could throw all that out the window and take it slowly. If you think your anti-internet family could handle it. Tell your parents about your "friend" on the internet, how cool he is and stuff. Shares funny stories about him, tell them how he has helped you, tell them things that make him seem awesome. Make his name known in your family. And then one day when you tell them you like him as more than just a funny game buddy, it might be easier.
tl;dr
I don't know if I helped at all. But you can do it!
Having a close family is a plus, but it hurts even more to disappoint them. I'll probably get shunned by my mother for a week or so...if not more... 
My sister doesn't approve of him for a few reasons. The fact that I met him online, that he's 5 years older than me, that he's still in college at 23(his major is a Ph.D., so he'll be in college for quite a few more years), that he's not really close with his family because his mom raised him herself because his dad left her when he was really young, that he doesn't live where I do, the fact that she knows my parents will be upset and not trust me as well, etc.
I agree. I plan on sitting her down and telling her everything and letting her know that this isn't just some fling that she thinks it is or whatever. I'm thinking about telling her first and then hearing what she has to say, and depending on that, telling my parents soon after, hopefully with her support. 
I know...and knowing that I'm going to hurt them and make them not trust me /temporarily/ is killing me inside. :( 
I'll probably end up staying at home for another 4 years or so, until I get finished my degree and establish a place for myself. 
Thanks. I think keeping calm and cool will be essential - even when things blow up. :/ 
&gt;I kept calm about it, I told her that I really wanted her to know, but that I was going to be in this relationship regardless of what she did, and that I was happy with it.
Thank you. I think that's really going to be important. 
That's a good point; I was thinking of telling them all about him and then calling him and letting them talk to him. I know he'd be terrified waiting for that call though. Another thing that I'd heard from a long distance internet relationship was that the girl had her SO talk to the parents on skype via webcam so that settled some of the creeper issues with her parents. I'm not sure what's a better idea...a letter, the phone, or cam?
&gt;I think that having this guy so close will help you. You will be able to see him fairly easily. Perhaps your parents would be okay with his coming to visit you all there, so they can be sure he is not going to kidnap you? That is how my mother felt about it.
I agree. The 12 hour drive isn't that bad, considering. In your opinion, would it be better to introduce it as; "he's visiting family in the next town over and can he swing by for a day?" *or* "He's coming out here solely to meet me. You guys can be there and I want you to be there, too."
I'd definitely let them be there when we met, for their comfort sake, and then meet in a public place of just him and I so that they feel comfortable with me out of their sight, but so that we won't have them hovering over us. 
Being open about it is another great point. Thank you. It puts the ball on their court that I'm okay with him and I want them to be okay with him and that there's nothing I'm hiding and there's nothing he's hiding. I think that will help them accept it easier. Thank you. 
Taking it slow would be extremely hard...my mom would put down everything that I was talking about with him. And it would make us wait even longer to see one another. It's already been two and a half years, and so they don't think I'm jumping into it, it'd have to be about that long again - and I don't think either of us want to wait that long for it to happen. 
It really helped, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've made some great points about being open and letting them accept it; its really helped and there's a lot that you've said that's let me see from the angle of someone else who's been through it and other ways to come about it for the least amount of fear/misunderstanding on anyone's part. Thank you!! 
It first hit my eyes and they began watering... then the back of the throat; a stinging sensation quickly building into a full burn. My exposed skin began to tingle and my sinuses began to leak.

I staggered to open a window and my stomach emptied itself on a few unlucky passers by below as i clung to the frame and gasped for clean air. 

After around 5 minutes (perhaps more, i may have blacked out) the burn seemed to peak. I was having great difficulty breathing, my eyes and nose were streaming, and i felt like i had a million fire ants crawling on my arms, neck and face.

My girlfriend realised i was in trouble and brought me a bucket of water and a towel. I did my best to wash myself down and after a further 10 minutes or so i felt the pain begin to subside.

 I rode it out like a boss and i made a full recovery 30 minutes or so after initial exposure.
Just let it go man, if she unfriended you, there's nothing that's going to happen there. Find someone else and use this as a learning experience. You probably did too much too fast, put too much pressure on it. get on match or okcupid and wink/message a ton of girls on there. You'll mess up on the first few messages but one will eventually give you a date then you start messing up on those and will learn how to do this stuff properly. And don't ever let your friend pull them aside and tell them how much of a newb you are, that will sink you fast. practice practice practice.
 Let her go, nothing is going to happen, you can't get them all but you can learn from the failures.
Nah, it's a Biblical passage. It comes from John 7:53-8:11. The story goes that a woman was accused of slavery and the Pharisees asked Jesus what should be done. Should they stone her as it is prescribed in the Law of Moses?
Jesus responds with: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her". All those there realized that they were not blameless nor sinless so they leave one by one until it is only Jesus and the Adulteress.
Jesus then says to her: "Go and sin no more".
 Clean up your own life before you start telling others to deal with theirs.
When I was away doing a field course last summer one of my peers set up these cameras to try and track coyote, and we caught a lot of rabbits and some bears but the timer was off (which is terrifying when you're in a field alone picking blueberries, and a prof/peer come up and tell you to keep your bearspray handy.). Also one of our cameras got stolen, and the only occupied cabin for a long while off said they didn't see it :/.
bears are scary and the woods hold a lot of douchebags
My parents were raised Christian. Dad was given the traditional Italian Catholic upbringing in the 50's, meaning that the sermons were done largely [if not completely] in Latin.  He said he practiced until they abandoned this part of the sermon. He's also a nuclear engineer, so those two aren't really compatible with each other. Mom, on the other had, was raised Christian Scientist, but stopped practicing because she felt that God killed and took her mother too early. Additionally, she has no college education. They never really took any of us [there are four siblings in my family] to church during our younger years and never included any religious practices in our daily activities with the exception of Easter and Christmas.  It was always an option for us to explore it on our own free will, but they never forced it upon us. In retrospect, I believe they felt that growing up in the south after moving from Massachusetts provided us enough Jebus exposure to make an opinion.
**TL/DR: My parents were raised Christian, got lazy in their old age, and didn't make us attend church. As a result, I was raised Atheist.**
Mom is loosely-theist/spiritual, dabbled in things like psychics and tarots and ghost stories. Her parents were Church of England and Methodist.
Dad is loosely christian from an uneducated Southern Baptist family. He's less and less christian every time we talk, though, so happy to report there's genuine progress being made there. 
I grew up with virtually no religious influence from either of them, though my dad did sometimes answer curious-kid questions with "goddunnit"s. "God" was an idea I was aware of because of the culture around me and on TV, so I did grow up figuring that there was some guy up in the clouds named God (much the same way I figured that there were people in suits called republicors and democracies whose jobs consisted of talking boringly to each other all day). 
Middle school I realized that I was uncomfortable with friends' religious families because I didn't know what they were talking about. Saying grace at a friend's house was the first really awkward experience I had, and it weirded me out. Saw a crucifix at another friend's house and got REALLY weirded out. Started seeing religion/christianity as something to recoil from. My parents backed me up, expressing their distaste of organized religion.
Late middle/ early high school I started claiming typical dumb kid stuff- "I'm wiccan and dark" and that sort of bullshit just to seem mysterious and different. Middle of high school I realized how dumb that was, and just rolled with "spiritual but not religious."
College, freshman year. Started with the SBNR, ended up with crazy (though sweet) jesus freak roommate who, through many long hours of discussion, led me to realize there truly wasn't an ounce of that stuff I could accept. Sophomore year philosophy and anthropology courses opened my eyes to how much is out there and how many other people have thought about this stuff before. I decided to narrow down what I actually did believe in.
By the end of college, I was atheist. A couple years afterwards, and thanks to acquiring a few like-minded friends and discovering /r/atheism, I made it official and "came out."
** Raised middle-of-the-road, came into atheism naturally over time.**
Idk why this makes me made, but it does.
I'm going to say it's hipster's who think they are edgy by saying we do things we know we do and blah blah.

Preface:I went to a public school in a well off suburban neighborhood, no uniforms or the like.  
The second semester of my eighth grade year I had some bad grades (an "F" a couple "Ds") so my father decided the best course of action was to take away all my normal clothes and replace them with white polo's and khaki pants for the rest of the school year. Also, he took the door away to my room and I was grounded in the normal sense of not being able to go out and play or use the internet.
 Only kid in a public school with a uniform, no door to room, no interwebz. 
When you first meet someone you are caught up in being nice, looking good and trying not to make a fool of yourself.  You don't notice imperfections and you are usually not staring at them naked.  This is why hollywood girls are so hot, you don't ever really see them.
I actually work in Hollywood, with a lot of beautiful ladies.  Everyone from A list stars to pornstars, strippers and your Victorias Secret type.  After a few hours or days you notice this stuff right away and everyone I work with becomes very normal.
- We imagine people are hot because we want them to be.  When we really get to look we find they are just like everyone else.
1.  This writer is needlessly highfalutin.
2.  In the original comic (spoilers from like 1968) [spoiler](/s "Spider-man fails to save Gwen Stacy.")  In fact, all of her complaints appear to be not about moral ambiguity but about deus ex machinas that save people from having to make hard choices, ignoring any and all instances where this doesn't happen. 
3. Not many people find pure good/evil conflicts believable.  
4. Why do you have to take something away from everything?  Not every piece of fiction is a fairy tale. 
5. What about instances where "the world is not black and white" *is* the takeaway.  Mobile Suit Gundam is a great example.  It's got all the trappings of a stereotypical military sci-fi show, except that the Zeon have legitimate motivations, and Zeon troops are routinely fleshed out characters who just happen to oppose the good guys.  The takeaway of the show isn't about who's right though, it's about the fact that both sides, right or wrong, are still human. 
 I think the writer's article is misdirected and misleading.  Also, a lot of us like moral ambiguity. 
Well here's some perspective from my experience:
I quit WoW back in 2007 after 3 years of playing because I felt like I was wasting my life. I went to college, got a degree, and landed a job, lost 50lbs, and picked up a passion for motorcycles. Overall, I feel fairly accomplished in not wasting my life.
...But I'm still not as happy as I was playing WoW. I kept some of the friends, but I never made it in real life as I did playing that game. I was on one of the most successful pvp/pve guild on the server, and knew dozens, if not hundreds of people. The interaction with those people made my day and I will never forget them.
My advice is to not cut yourself off from those friendships (or quit WoW/gaming entirely). I quit gaming as well, but like you, it was my only true passion and escape from the real world, and I returned after a few months. The "shock" of losing so many friends at once was hard for me to cope with, and still bothers me to this day. 
Limit your playtime to no more than 4 hours a day, learn something new, and try to grab the contact info of some of your buddies. Some of my best friends are the people I played WoW with back in 2004. 
Kind of creepy how this post reminds me of myself a few years ago...
*** Start putting your real life ahead of the game, not the other way around; you don't' have to give it up entirely.

"Unforeseen consequences" ^^
You can try working out. Be vain, do it for the ladies. It's really easy (you just have to bump up your protein intake), and it has to be the single thing with the most positive side-effects of all the things you can do. Honestly, it's ridiculous when you've gained a few pounds on the chest and arms, and suddenly women starts looking at you. And the few hours you spend on video games will be so much more entertaining.
- I was raid leader until Cata came out. Then I took working out more seriously, got a bit more egotistical and started seeing more girls.
What is wrong with this design:
Near as I can see, there are at most, 5 roads in this development that provide actual *connectivity.*  Every other road shown here is a dead end that has been optimistically renamed a cul-de-sac.  What they are known as (to many planners) are publicly-financed private roads.  These roads are paid for, presumably, from some sort of general roads fund(s).  The roads themselves, other the other hand, only benefit those who live in the cul de sac.  This is the general public taxpayer boosting the property values of cul de dac dwellers (an interesting example of Public Choice Theory in action if there ever was one).
Roads are *public.*  The public pays for them, the public should have access to them.  Moreover, the roads should provide a general service to the public, not the 10 families who live in this or that cul de sac.  The general public has no reason to ever drive on the majority of the roads shown here.  Remember the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska that Palin was vilified for in the last prez election?  Well every cul de sac ever built is a road to nowhere.
Roads are the bones of a city.  Show me a road network, and only a road network, and I will tell you a story about that city and what it is probably like.
If roads are the bones of city, a cul de sac is like a vestigial tail.  The only thing you can do is cut it off.  
These roads are a kind of trap.
Well-designed roads should be versatile, adaptable, and repurposable.  They should offer multiple routes and transportation options.  These roads offer single routes, with a single transportation option (a car).  Roads and development of this nature often result in densities which are inadequate for efficient mass transit.  Transit here would likely need to be heavily subsidized.
Cities are not end products.  They are constantly changing, evolving, morphing.  A city is not ‘finished’ unless it is dead.  Cul de sacs are finished (e.g. dead) roads.
Seriously, pick any two buildings on this map.  Run a test:  How many different ways can you go between these structures?  Most cases, I’ll bet you can find only one path.  In all cases, it looks like you will run into a choke-point where there is only one way in and one way out.  That is the opposite of versatile.
What happens when this neighborhood needs to change?  Or are we supposed to believe that change will never be needed here?  Well-designed road networks can be repaired and repurposed for decades or centuries.  What is this road network going to be used for, beside single-family residential?  The people who live in this space have locked in a kind of land-use super-ownership through the road network they have managed to get created for themselves.  The public is not only subsidizing the de-facto private roads here, the public is subsidizing the home values and land uses that are in place by subsidizing this road network.
An engineer might say that roads can just be rebuilt as needed.
Great.  When are we supposed to do that?  And how?  Using eminent domain?  Right……  That will go through the city council, no problem at all.
Roads are more permanent than most folks would like to admit.
Roads are not physically permanent.  They are politically permanent.  Once there, they are often there to stay.  Who is going to volunteer to have their building(s) knocked down to make way for a new road network?  The only question is how many lawsuits will be produced by a road restructuring plan.
Even worse are the super-sized versions of this development-type that now exist in many cities.  At some point, this one-way-in-one-way-out system of road design can even become a safety hazard.  Hurricanes, volcanoes, or terrorist threats are just some examples of why multiple routes in and out of place are very good.  Routine road construction/repair operations are another good example of why people need transportation options (an engineer should be able to appreciate this).  It is hard to run people over to a detour when there is no other road to move traffic to.
You don’t need multiple routes to get from point A to point B, until you do.  Then you really, really need a versatile road network. 
  These roads are unfair, unadaptable, potentially dangerous, inconvenient, and wasteful.  These roads are a trap.
While yes, opiate substitutes can produce a mild-'buzz' type feeling for an addict with waning tolerance, or an addict who just dosed out of withdrawals, for the most part opiate tolerance prevents this from occuring beyond much of a point. Suboxone is a partial mu-type receptor agonist, while methadone is a partial/full agonist mix. These drugs also 'blockade' the receptors. Meaning you need more of a more powerful agonist to 'over-ride' the blockade. However, if you take suboxone and then take a full agonist opiate, you will cause yourself to withdrawal. Precipitated withdrawal. (i.e. hell on earth.)
: Of course they will have abuse potential, but only for non-addicts or opiate naive individuals. 
As an American, I wonder about this all the time.  I know it isn't *me*, or anyone I know (sideless and on either 'side').  I want it to be me and everyone else, because I think a democracy would be a good thing to try... but as it stands, I suspect it is the media.  Which are mostly owned by rich conservative white guys who need to keep their hand in the game to make sure nobody starts making them pay taxes or something.

I think the whole point of Shellder and Slowpoke was to work together. Shellder gains a food source by being attached to an Pokemon, a Pokemon that now has the balance to stand upright and walk about. 
Shellbro would be forever alone.
&gt;Besides, why is "immersion" so important? I've never seen a game sell itself as "immersive" and actually be.
Immersion isn't usually a selling point for the same reason 'Fantastic Foley editing' isn't a part of advertising campaigns. They're important to the game, but they're something that can only take place as a background component.  In general, no one thinks 'Man, those are some pretty awesome footstep noises that lizard man is making, it's totally what I think a large bipedal lizard foot sounds like!'  If it's done right, you don't even consciously notice, but if it was done wrong or left out entirely it would jar the experience and be very noticeably lacking.  The same for immersion. It's not something you actively work at while playing a game, but something you slip into.  I didn't try to agitate myself while playing Amnesia, but because of all the background components in play, I slipped into the main characters shoes and felt what I believed he felt in those situations.
Immersion is one of those things that only works when you don't try at it as the player, nor does it work if it's your sole focus as a developer, it's the result of good work on many levels.
I agree with that first paragraph. I liked the Water Temple in the original OOT actually way more than the Fire Temple. The First I played through it, it was me and my sister, and we would play at different times and complete different dungeons, or just help each other out. Interestingly enough, I completed the Water temple all by myself (at age 10). I've since beaten it 3 or 4 times and all I can say is that it is difficult, but I like that it encourages you to think ahead several steps, something reinforced by the fact you have to pause and constantly change your equipment (and play songs). And other than a few really well hidden keys (did anyone else find themselves missing a key right before the room to Dark Link screaming **FFUUU**?"), I found the dungeon pretty fair. I think Nintendo did the right thing but not completely rebooting the temple and instead just making it a much smoother experience for younger gamers and those who didn't enjoy it.
 Water temple wasn't that bad, spare a few interface problems. I liked that they only fixed these problems in OOT3D as opposed to changing everything.
Sandy Bridge runs cooler. The previous generation Core i7 (s1366) had a much higher TDP (140W vs 95W now).
The most current AMD Phenom II 1100T has a TDP of 125W.
Before Sandy Bridge, Phenom II ran equal to or cooler than Intel Core.
I understand that "a few bad apples spoil the bunch" makes us skeptical of the intentions of all police officers, but she was obviously trying her hardest to be difficult and confrontational in the most legal way possible. If you listened to the officer speak for just two seconds you could hear that all he wanted to do was his job and gave her many opportunities to avoid a confrontation which she had to have seen coming. 
tldr, she had it coming.
The problem with this argument is that it is illogical.  We have a rational legal system, though not a perfect one.  To argue that we should not break down crimes more specifically in order to more accurately and fairly determine punishment, because that in itself leads to greater levels of inaccuracy/inconsistency, is illogical.  
While you are right in thinking that if we removed judicial discretion completely we would end up with one-size-fits-all punishments, you are wrong in thinking that systemic rationalism in the direction of more specificism, as Leshiy was alluding to, does the same thing.  For couldn't the entirety of our differentiable legal system be less so?  No murder 1, 2, manslaughter voluntary or involuntary, just "killer" with one sentence or broad range for judicial discretion (creepy and scary).  Couldn't all theft be left as theft with one single punishment for all of them?
Since We, the People, are responsible for our laws in this Republic, systemic logic and fairness is our responsibility.  The judge at the helm is responsible for the last bit of rationalism.  The two work together; system first, judge second.  This is why before a trial there is a hearing to determine if the case fits the crime and a trial should proceed.  Cutting down on irrational judicial discretion is accomplished with greater systemic rationalism, or, the tighter we bound our judges the less effect their errors can have.
Or to put it another way, while you are right in believing that we could never perfectly nail ever single nuance of every single potential crime, you don't honestly think that the opposite (to not try at all) actually accomplishes the goal of a fairer system?  You confused the plausibility of perfection with the effect of the attempt, generally.  This resulted in an illogical statement akin to, "since the system WILL NOT be perfect, therefore, it WILL NOT be fair."  When the more logical argument would have been, "since the system WILL NOT be perfect, therefore, it WILL NOT be PERFECTLY fair."  Which implies that the effort towards perfect rationalism isn't inversely related to fairness in law, somehow, but aligned and only as fair as we deem it necessary to make it.
There is, however, an inverse relationship here, that is, judicial discretion vs. systemic specificism/rationalism.
   
Therefore, the more specific the system is, the less discretion judges have.
I really hate to be an advocate for Flash, because it does cause problems in browsers, but Adobe Flash itself is not really the cause of most Flash problems.
The problem is that Flash has a fully capable interpreted language that's kind of like a cross between Javascript and C#, called ActionScript.  While not itself a problem (and in fact is pretty cool), it is very easy for novices to write memory leaks and run-away loops.  Flash banner ads are particularly bad about this.  One bad banner ad is usually all it takes to drive a computer into the ground and maybe convince the OS that it's time to put the parent process out of its misery.
 The problem is that flash allows shitty flash scripts; flash itself is pretty robust.
I was under the impression that the "sterility objection" (yep, your objection has been called that) wasn't taken as a serious contender in these debates.
Here's another snippet from the same author: 
&gt; Some analogies may clarify the point we are making. Suppose Smith has a temporary digestive disorder so that, although he can eat, he frequently vomits, and thus many of his meals are not digested.  As a consequence, when Smith sits down to eat a meal he cannot be sure whether this particular one will result in increased nourishment. Still, he continues to eat, and his meals as a set are ordered to his nourishment. When Smith eats he is exercising his digestive system: what he does is the same for every meal, though many individual instances do not result in nourishment. He is engaging in nourishing activity, even if this particular act does not nourish, because he is performing the behavior that is in his power, which is capable in some instances of nourishing.  One could say that he is performing a nourishing-type act. In other words, what makes a human act to be of a certain type is one's performance of what one is capable of which (one understands) in some instances results in the relevant effect.
&gt; This means that Smith would be performing a nourishing-type act even if--perhaps because full digestion led to time-consuming elimination--he hoped that this particular act did not result in nourishment.  Moreover, his eating would still be a nourishing-type act if his disorder got worse, his stomach was closed, and he obtained his nourishment intravenously. In that case, he might eat in order to exercise that part of his digestive system still functioning, or to share a meal with a friend. Likewise with reproductive-type acts. Reproduction, or procreation, is not an action directly under our control. Its conditions are non-behavioral as well as behavioral.  What we do is an act which in some instances may result in procreation. Moreover--and here reproduction is distinct from other acts--by performing that act the male and the female become one organism, two-in-one-flesh. When that one-flesh unity is an aspect of a total marital communion, it is a rational and sufficient motive and justification for that act. But humans (and other mammals) become one flesh (one organism) only if they perform the type of act which in some instances procreates, only if they perform a reproductive-type act.
**TL:DR** He seems to be saying that the sexual act of a infertile married couple can be reproductive *type* acts, whereas a homosexual couple can never engage in reproductive type acts.
He obviously doesn't deny that heterosexual married people who, while not infertile, have YET to had a child, are married. Likewise, I doubt he or anyone would deny that heterosexual couples who are married and who CAN'T have a child (because of infertility) are married?. In both cases the marriage would entail or could entail reproductive type acts.
Notice that the phrase used in the paragraph that made you snore is "a union procreative in **kind**". So, your objection that he is overlooking sterile couples seems to miss the mark. 
$2000. Enough to get a crappy used car, which would solve so many of my problems. I'm a smart eighteen year old guy who had to drop out of my four year university after one year because it was far too expensive and far away from home. (I have had several sick family members and family deaths, but was too far away from my family to be with them at those times.) Anyway, this next school year, I'm taking a step down and going to the community college in my town. But even then, the school is far enough away (over about 20 miles) and without reliable bus service that I don't know how I'm going to get back and forth on school days. School starts on August 22 and I haven't even registered for classes yet because getting there daily is such a daunting problem. I'd love to be working a second job to make more money, but it's hard enough finding a bus in this small town I live in. Bumming rides with friends and family is so old, and taxis are expensive. I don't date or go out with friends much, because I can't transport myself. Even my closest friends think it's a buzzkill to chauffeur me around all the time. It really sucks. I'm only 18 and missing out on this whole teenage car culture has hurt a lot.
 $2000 would, in conjunction with my savings, get me enough money to buy a cheap car and change several aspects of my life.
I'd go to him, and tell him to turn his goddamn music down, he's not alone in the house, and you also have a 2 year old daughter. If he still doesn't turn it down, I'd simply call the police (yes, you can call the police for "Öffentliche Ruhestoerung", public disturbing of ...peace i guess? (english is leaving me here) in Germany.) and have him at least issued a warning. 
**try to be nice to him, and if it doesn't work, be angry. Angry people are most of the time pretty intimidating to people.**
I actually am coming from the opposite spectrum from you, DJ.
I started out with MvC2/MvC3 and made the switch to SSF4 a month or so back.  And I have to say....
SSF4 is a far more enjoyable experience than MvC3.  But, MvC3 is still more enjoyable to watch...it's a lot more hype (imo).
Here's why I don't enjoy MvC3: 
**Xfactor** you can be destroying your opponent the entire match, but if they have the right anchor...say...Akuma, Wesker, Sent, or Phoenix...and they X-factor, your entire team can be taken out VERY quickly in 3 quick combos.  So you're winning the whole game and then lose it all due to X-Factor.
**Phoenix/Dark Phoenix**.  Yes you can tailor your team to combat her. Yes there are strats to get her out of the way like snapping her in early and try to knock her out before she gets 5 bars for Dark Phoenix.  Nevertheless, if you fail and she gets Dark Phoenix+ Level 3 Xfactor...well you can kiss your team goodbye. VERY fast.
**Wolverine** He is the most broken character of all.  He has above average health. He's ridiculously fast and has a super that makes him faster.  He has godlike crossups naturally...pair him up with a great assists like Akuma or Sent and good like beating him. His divekick has an insane hit box.  And his damage output is just ridiculous.  Capcom needs to fix him. He is broken
**Too much** This is more of a personal issue, though you may fall under this as well.  There's just too much that you need to juggle, master, and be aware of to be successful at this game.  Your characters' moves--all three of them. Your characters' assists.  Your characters' healths.  Your super bar. Combos. Combos. Combos.  And matchups.  It's just too much for me.  
**YOU CANNOT FUCK UP** If you are playing an opponent that knows what they are doing, you cannot fuck up. If you do, you're going to lose at least one character--due to one combo.  Guaranteed.  That's just MvC3. Touch of death combos.  Three fuckups and you're probably gonna lose the match....unless you have a good anchor and X-factor. 
*** I'd say skip playing MvC3 and save yourself the blood curtling screams it induces and the saltiness that lasts for a while. Just watch The Marvelous Adventures of Gootecks and Mike Ross for proof--pure salt.
&gt; Reddit.com was built by entrepreneurs in an environment of low regulation (= the internet).
The Internet was a governmental project for much of its early life. Your link confirms this. Indeed, the Internet backbones were funded until 1994 by the government.
Your link's argument is "well maybe it'd have been even better if it'd been privately engineered!" -- which is a silly argument. Maybe Internet access would be half the cost and ten times the bandwidth if the government ran it all. No, I won't present evidence for that, but you know, *maybe!*
Or maybe the Internet would have tiered pricing and sites like reddit.com would never have been able to get the bandwidth together to get off the ground, if it'd been private from the start. This is, after all, the whole point of net neutrality -- to enable small businesses and individuals and new technologies equal access to the Internet.
Why would a commercially-controlled Internet allow P2P technologies like bittorrent?
From the linked article:
&gt; As a result, we are left with a panoply of lingering inefficiencies, misallocations, abuses, and political favoritism.
The misallocations and favoritism part of that sentence has to do with wireless spectrum, which has little to nothing to do with the Internet.
I don't have any idea what "abuses" the author is talking about, and the "inefficiencies" are the lack of tiered pricing and a packet-switching design. Amusingly, the author uses an example of these inefficiencies:
&gt; A packet containing a surgeon's diagnosis of an emergency medical procedure has exactly the same chance of getting through as a packet containing part of Coldplay's latest single or an online gamer's instruction to smite his foe.
Yep. And they'll all get through in substantially less than a second. Or, if one was living in a place with extreme regulations, like Sweden, you'd be able to have that doctor give a video diagnosis and have the delay be substantially less than a second, as you'd have absurdly huge amounts of free bandwidth.
&gt; Very little (if any?) of that code comes from any government.
True.
&gt; Reddit Gold is an opt-in feature.
Well duh; advertisements are reddit's primary source of income.
&gt; Anybody can make a sub reddit about anything.
The natural world isn't like the Internet. You can't just create a new country on new land.
&gt; Moderators are the free-market version of police.
They're more like dictators (government) of their subreddits, but ok.
&gt; You are free to post what you want.
You are not free to post what you want if what you want is a commercial ad. You will be banned completely from reddit if all you post is ads. Reddit admins and mods are constantly working to keep advertisements out.
&gt; And what's with TLDRs? They aren't required by any law
... and this is evidence of what?
There are several ways people learn; visually, auditory and tactile. I, for instance, can't remember a single thing I read. For that, I have never bought a book for college unless it was an online class because I knew I would not be able to learn anything from reading. I also don't learn by doing things. It's much harder for me to do Lab type classes because during the lab there is not much sound going on. You read the book, and do the experiment.
I can watch a movie once, and remember most of the good lines, or remember word for word a long sentence I heard from a long time ago. I got through Paramedic school having never bought the books with an A-. 
Likewise, I have never NOT received an A in a lecture class. If you look at my transcripts from 4 years work of college, my grades that are A's were lecture classes, and if its a B or lower, it either was an online class, or a lab.
People learn in three different ways, hearing is only 1 way.
My take on why certain lines are engrained so well in some people's minds is by how much of an emotion it can invoke out of someone or how well they relate to the situation.
I can not only remember Jon Favreu saying ". . .and I'm supposed to be impressed because she's wearing a backpack" from Swingers, but also the look on his face as he was talking to Vince Vaughn over the phone, the slight disparity in his voice over wanting to go out and meet new people but still getting over a breakup.  I remember it well because I could link it to a time when I was getting over a breakup.
I remember scenes from Spaceballs "Keep firing assholes!" due to my love of Star Wars and attempting to catch all the subtleties in the movie "What's the matter Colonel Sanders - chicken??".  It also helped that it was replayed on WPIX on a never ending loop through my childhood.
Now, upon initial viewing, it can be tough to recall the lines immediately.  However, depending on the subject of the movie and how your experiences relate to it or what situation you were in at the moment (breakup?  just married?  thinking of quitting job?  getting over a specific fear? etc), certain scenes will stand out better than others.  
Other scenes are so outrageous "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!" that you just can't help but remember it due to the initial shock value.
- It all depends on you, my friend.  Get out there and experience as much as you can in life and you'll find that movies will attempt to tap into those parts, so much so you can remember the lines that pertain to you, or are so opposite of you that you can't help but remember them as well.
My rule about those who sound like they are under 12 is simple. If they throw out insults left and right, they deserve no respect. If they never did anything to do anything to piss anyone off and are getting mocked, then I will defend them to the ends of the earth.
Oddly enough, my rules are the same for people who sound 20.
tell him to STFU
I assume he means learner, at which point his post is a bit more logical...
Starter bikes don't necessarily need low CC's... They should be in condition that a drop or two won't make you be like "NO MY PRECIOUS BABY!"
I mean, a drop will always make you feel like that, but you know what I mean, right?  If it's a beater or a super sport, sure, go ahead.  If it's brand spanking new just warn them that they are going to end up dropping it, making it less then a pretty new bike.
- used, cheap bikes are good for learners, CC's don't matter as much IMO
It was thrown off along with a couple other already dead siblings as well as a sister that only made it halfway to shore and a kennel (unsure if they were thrown out in the kennel and the kennel broke apart in the water or if it was just evidence disposal) which were found floating an average of a mile off shore, slightly spread about a point about a mile out. So exact figure is unknown, but people sadly did this quite often and they usually threw them out at this place often as it wasn't in view of any public beaches.
(Whenever a stray washed up on a beach we sent out a boat to a couple known abandonment hotspots)
- He wasn't the only one thrown off, found his dead siblings floating around a known abandonment hotspot about a mile from where he ended up on shore. Found his sister halfway between the two.
oh. my. god. my reputation is ruined!!!!!!!!!!
i would try to explain the differences between errors in usage vs errors of omission and how they don't really carry the same weight... but i'm not sure you would understand — it doesn't involve *any* memes or clichés.
 you sound fat
nice edit, btw... wonder what i missed.
Well, it really depends on what she wants. She's basically out Palined Palin, so when she loses in the primary, she could just quit congress, write books about Jesus and "Real Americans" and roll in the dough. 
However, I see her as a much more dedicated crazy than Palin. Palin was clearly in in for the money and fame rather than to actually implement her crazy-ass BS. Bachmann has the look of a real ideologue who actually wants to climb up into your vagina and teach your unborn fetus about Jesus our Savior and Reganomics. She's actually scarier than Miss Alaska because she believes in her cause and is willing to act. 
- She actually has a golden ticket now because fundies love other wacko fundies. Just depends if she goes the Palin route.
Kudos to you for putting it into words! 
I'm from St. Paul, MN, and couldn't agree more. My sister and brother-in-law live up in "Bachmann Territory". It still amazes me that just 30 minutes outside of Minneapolis/St. Paul is the goddamned backwoods of the North where someone like this can gain a foothold. I really worry about my niece and nephew, who are 3 and 5, and the 4-day school week which Bachmann and her constituents have fully embraced. And that's the tip of the iceberg.
I've been lurking the Reddit for nearly a year now. This post finally got me to comment because I have wanted to say the exact same thing many, many times but never had the stones to do it. I'm glad someone finally did, and the least I can do is say thank you. So, thanks.
 i like hats. 
For future reference: take U of I courses ONLINE if they're available. If it's some whimpy gen-ed (100-200 level) it's probably available. There's two types of online classes, OO and CB. Online Only and Campus Based respectively (I think). I was originally enrolled in a CB section of RST 218, an extremely easy class, and my tuition came out to $1909. After talking to the lady at the registrar's office about cheaper options for just 3 credit hours, she put me into the OO section that dropped tuition from $1298 to ~950 and removed every fee except the UIUC General Fee that they use to pay overhead. In total my tuition is now $1062 that I paid today. Much better.
*** take online if available, specifically the OO section.
THERE IS NO REASON TO GET A 6.0gb/s HDD.  Just wanted to make that obvious for anybody scanning the page.  Mechanical drives don't even reach the 3.0gb/s, it's a marketing scam like the stats monster cables put on the box.  However SDD's CAN reach these speeds, only care about that stat when looking at a solid state drive.
As to why they are so good, the spinpoint is alwas recommended is that the barracuda's (and almost all hard drives) have a large tendency to be DOA or not last a long time. The spinpoint has much better reliability. In addition, the spinpoint and caviar blacks (the nicest of the colors) come out almost exactly equal when compared, however the blacks run around $20 more.
Spinpoint is more reliable than most drives, fast as shit, and cheaper than comparable drives.  The 3.0gb/s and 6.0gb/s does not matter with HDD"s, only SDD's.
Ok, so it was my 21st birthday party. Recently my buddy had acquired two vials of LSD, but this guy at his house tripped out and had to be taken to the ambulance, so he gave me the remains of both of them. Seeing as how I felt comfortable with the drug, and of course being an idiot at the same time, I put the contents of one of the almost empty vials in my mouth. I don't know how many drops there were, maybe 4 or 5, but I then proceeded to feel up the empty vial with some water and suck on it for a few minutes. Bad idea.
We still had like 3 hours or so to go before the party started, and we got a keg of blue moon for the party (remember, I was just 21) and we had two bags of oranges to cut. For some reasons these oranges looked like the most delicious things in the world, so I went in the kitchen and ate about 4 or 5 of them, covering my face and shirt with juice in the mean time. 
In the living room we had a bug's life playing, and I remember sitting down and realizing the movie was making less &amp; less since, so I went into my room and laid down and played some music. I realized that the best way to appreciate the sound was to lay on the ground next to this big ass speaker. After two hours of doing this the spackle on the ceiling started falling into my mouth, it was just raining down. I started having these ideas about my friends, I started thinking that the whole city is waiting outside to sing me happy birthday. I remember thinking my room mates planned to recreate a dream sequence by tying me up with strings. My muscles started to become so rigid that I stopped moving fluidly when I walked around, and apparently at one time tears were coming down my face, but I wasn't crying.
We had to stop the party and kick everyone out because I was just too bat shit crazy. I'm leaving a lot out for brevity's sake, but it was definitely the most interesting trip I've ever had.
 Took a bunch of acid on my birthday and had to cancel the party because I lost my mind for 12 hours.
Well, it certainly helps with my home network.  I run a Windows Home Server for both media and PC backups.  The first backup I attempted was painfully slow - 2.9MB/s transfer speed on strong wireless N hardware.  I would have taken a full 2 days just for the first backup!
Next I tried a regular 100Mb wired setup and was pegged at 12.5MB/s, which was still painfully slow.  Now I use a gigabit switch and transfer at 80-110MB/s - basically at full hard drive speed.  It's a reasonable amount of time for backups now.
****  You still don't need a gigabit router to get gigabit transfers on your network.  Just get a proper [switch](  PS, wait for a sale on that model.  It happens frequently.
I was returning home from the military and I was flying from DIA to Cheyenne, WY (100 miles... takes a little under 2 hours to drive). I get to DIA from Missouri and I hear there is a 2 hour delay.  The airline would periodically add an hour every so often. Found out they wanted to try to fill the tiny 20 seater plane as much as they could. Ended up leaving out with 6 people on the plane for the 45 minute flight. This was over 10 years ago, and I wish to this day I would have remembered what flight it was so I could never do business with them again.
Arrived at DIA (Denver) at 6pm and was delayed for 8 hours for a 45 minute flight.
All games that you buy on steam stay attached to your account so just log into steam on your account (from your new computer) and download the games again. You don't need to transfer the games in the traditional sense (with some sort of physical disc or drive).
Also, don't lose your steam account info. 
**** yes
Interesting answers. I consider myself a fan of the sport enough that I'll watch games outside of my fanship, and loosely root for just about half of the MLB. And I have teams I outright will not root for.
* I'm a Yankees fan, first and foremost (NY born &amp; raised)
* Second to them, I'll root Indians (why not?), Twins (love their fanship), Royals (serious underdogs), Mariners (just an interesting franchise), A's (friend is an A's fan), Nationals (underdogs), Brewers (c'mon!), and Cubbies (c'mon!!!)
* Absolutely will not root for Red Sox, Rays / Jays / Orioles (division), Tigers (pathetic), Rangers (too good lately), Angels (same), Phillies (hate the team, the fans [sorry], and some of my idiot friends are fans), Mets (same), and Diamondbacks (long story).
The most complicated aspect is that I live in Boston now, and so I'm in Nation territory. Again, I love baseball and for the most part I respect the Sox. Plus their stadium is great and I'm walking distance from it. So I'll go to games for the sake of baseball but I absolutely will not actively root for them unless it's late September and them winning benefits the Yankees in some way.
** Yankees fans, half-fan of about 8 other teams, full-fan of MLB**
Red Sox fan out of the womb. I grew disenchanted with the team around 2007.
Can't stand Lucchino. Henry is blah, but he did make the park much better. Hard to root for the FAs: Renteria, Lugo, Crawford, and Lackey. 
I enjoy flipping back and forth between games now, watching good pitcher/batter matchups and seeing the young stars.
The thought of me having to root for Matt Albers just because he's wearing a Red Sox jersey--like I would've done pre-2007--is laughable to me now. Don't get me wrong; a journeyman story can be somewhat interesting, but I'd prefer to invest my game-watching time in the Hosmers, Heywards, Tulos, Lincecums, Poseys, etc. 
 Having no "first team" is pretty fun, too.
Yeah, you're right. My dog totally didn't need the $3000 worth of vet visits and surgery to make sure that his broken leg got properly fixed so he could walk again.
And when I had 3 tires blow out, I didn't need to spend the $450 to get it fixed so I can go to work. 
And I don't need to pay for all those medications that keep me alive every month. 
Clearly, my debt is all just extraneous and frivolous. 
 LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE IN DEBT BECAUSE THE COST OF NECESSARY THINGS ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT, *NOT* DUE TO BUYING SHIT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD.
I would just like to point out that statistics like this can always be manipulated to support whatever side you want to.
For example, a lot of the productivity improvement since 1980 has been a result of the incredibly increase in technology that's happened since then. Imagine what computers could do in 1980 vs what they do today. They've made it possible for workers to do less and be more productive. They've made it possible for less workers to be more productive. Etc. You have to figure this as a *downward* force on wages because it's a substitute for labor that's effective. Instead of a factory full of workers on assembly lines, you have two workers and a foreman overseeing an assembly line of computer controlled robots.
 I implore you to use critical thinking when evaluating these claims.
Everyone who things like this isn't doing a very thorough analysis of the situation.
It's not corporate overlords, it's competition.  Without these productivity increases the rest of the world would destroy us.  Our wages are so high that just to keep them that high we have to be way more productive than the average chinese dude who gets paid so much less.
Unfortunately this is a fact of life.  You could cut off free trade but that just makes things even worse.  The real fix (and the fix to stabilizing our population as well) is to bring living standards up to our standards all over the world.  How do we do this?  Increase productivity.
just because you increase productivity doesn't mean wages go up.  The increases can be eaten in plenty of other ways including lower prices.

You're missing the point - the two issues are inherently related.  Thanks to ever-improving global communication and transportation networks, first-world citizens no longer enjoy a monopoly on first world labor.  There is no "going back."  We're going to need to either learn to compete, learn to live with less (relatively), or some combination thereof.
Two observations, as an addendum:
1) If an American/Western European is going to demand 10x the wages of a worker in China/Vietnam/Tanzania, they had better be able to deliver 10x the value.  Obviously, this is pretty challenging.
2) The globalization of labor has been an enormous net-positive for the world population.  Literally hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people, now have a shot at something approaching a decent standard of living.
First-world citizens need to get over themselves
the point your missing is that you assume total labor value/pay is static and distribution is whats on question...
the real issue is that wealth is being collected and taken out of the available pool by certain players... THATS the problem...
so the problem isn't that payscales are shifting to other countries (yes thats happening) but more that we in the us are being valued less FASTER than others are being valued more... its not a fair sifting of pay, therers money being taken out of the game to a large extent.
lets say the world was 3people. 1us 1brit and 1chinese.  the us gets $10/hr, the brit gets $8 per hour and the chinese $2.
your theory is that the us guy is getting.dropped to $7 the brit to $6 and the chinese guy gets that $5 bringing him up to $7.
that would be fair but a birter pill.
but.whats really happening is that the us guy is.getting dropped to $6, the brit to $6 and the chinese guy is getting bumped to $3.  see money is.disapearing feom that game and THATS thw problem... all this while MORE work is being done by the 3... imagine through all this that they all get 50% of their vacation taken away and their benefits taken away.
now do you see the problem?  its not that fair value is shifting money from me to someone else its that someone is stwaling money from the pot so really evwrypne ia getting paid less for more work.
tldr its not that the other guys are making their fare share now, its that we are all being robbed.  just i happen to have more to lose.
sorry for spelling, cell phone.
Valid points even though I do not take the arguments from authority (Quoting the founding fathers and what not) as per se points. I think both our opinions do not differ that far in the religion/atheism debate as such but my issue here was not to point out that we need adress these things but that Darwinism and evolution theory belongs into /r/science and not into /r/atheism.
Just like the theories about gravity do not belong here, even though:
&gt;Newton was also highly religious. [source](
I understand the importance that it plays but you still failed to give a convincing argument why Darwinism belongs into the atheism section as it is not related to faith. You can be a believer and still approve evolution theory.
Also: Sorry for the late reply, I did not have a lot of spare time lately
 I still fail to see why evolution belongs in /r/atheism
Oh god, i have to explain my explanation???
Okay, let's try it like this. Let's say you have a box like this (imagine it's a 3d box and there's depth to it equal to the length/height as per a normal box):
XX  
XX
The height is "perceived sound level", which is to say: how loud you think it is. Now, in order to increase the level do you want to add to the height directly or to the volume of the box? That's right, you want to add to the height directly--ie, use a logarithmic scale like dB. But what if you're ignorant, like computer programmers who write linear sound level sliders? Then you'll set it up so you add to the box's "volume". In that case, our 2x2x2 "box" would be a "volume 8" (2 cubed). What if you want to go up to "sound level 3", like so?
XXX  
XXX  
XXX
Then if you're using a logarithmic scale you go +1.
If you're using a volume scale? You have to go up to 27, or +19. If you want to go to 4?
XXXX  
XXXX  
XXXX  
XXXX
Either you need to go to 4 (+1 more), or (with the bad way) to 64 (+37). Notice how that's actually a bigger increase last time for the same "perceived" difference?
If you want to go all the way [up to 11]( you either need +7 (with the "correct" approach) or +1267 (with the "bad" method).
So, now imagine you have two sliders: one slider is logarithmic and goes from 0-10, the other is linear and goes from 0-1000. At those lower values, the "linear" slider's scale is too high to correctly adjust them--you're dealing with the bottom 10% of the scale. At a "5" rating on logarithmic (about 50% loudness on the 0-10 scale) you'd be at 125 on the linear scale--almost at the bottom. The top 50% only covers the loudness levels from (around) 8-10 on the logarithmic slider.
(Edit)
The reason this "makes sense" to me is because sound is something that happens in 3d, physical space. Which is to say, when you add power to whatever is making the sound it has to fill up that space--fill the volume. But you're not hearing all the sound throughout the entire physical space, you're just hearing it at one point.

If you've got heaps of free time and you need to structure it, here's what you do. Body first. The mind will follow. 
How fit are you? If the answer is "Um..." do [this]( Just do it. Start today. Start now. Print out a copy of the plan and hang it on your wall. Two weeks in, tell me where your mind is. 
Give your mind time to wander by getting away from the computer screen. 
You'll never do anything unless you can learn to focus on the process rather than the goal. Think about that every time you start running. If you have no inspiration, you have no inspiration. Keep running, and keep trying new things. You don't force willpower; it arises on its own when you're truly conscious of the benefits of doing something. 
Give your body a chance to learn how much better life can be. After a bit, it will start wanting to do things of its own accord. 
 Start doing stuff. It will make you want to do more stuff. 
P.S. There is no formula, no way to make it happen. You will not know how to make it happen. Nobody knows how to make it happen for you. You will suffer many hours of feeling hopeless and futile. There is only one way to make anything happen in this world and that is to try, and try, and try, and try, and try. It's going to be hard. It's going to be fun. It's going to be agonising. Just accept that, and then start doing stuff. 
JUST START. 
The problem I've encountered with relying solely on perlin noise for heighmaps is that the resulting terrain does not have the same appearance we've come to expect in real life. You get mountains and valleys and such, but the organization at a macro level still looks completely random. Regardless of how you combine your octaves, you can still zoom out some amount and just get a random mess of mountains and lakes.
This isn't to say that perlin is bad - in fact, perlin is one of the best 3d density functions you can use for voxel terrain. Granted - in the article above, we're using voxel mechanics and the Marching Cubes algorithm, but we're still using a 2d heightmap in place of the density function. However, if this proves to be ultimately not up to par with what we're trying to achieve, we'll be switching over to a real 3d density function.
Sorry if I'm rambling -  perlin is a fantastic tool, but it's difficult to get the organization we expect in natural terrain without using it in conjunction with other tools.
There's one of these run-off pools in a quarry near me (Derbyshire), a few years ago it rained hard and the banks of it burst, all the water from it flowed down through the village and into the local river and loads of fish died, turns out those pools are rammed with toxins. 
don't swim in quarry water, shit is toxic.
I wasn't sure at first if this was Fahrenheit or Celsius, so then I converted the 57°; turns out if that was Celsius, the Fahrenheit would be 134°. Since 134° is a highly unlikely temperature to reach, I assumed that this chart was already in Fahrenheit.

The Time-Turner goes back one hour per turn.  In order to go back and prevent the Potter murders, (from the timeframe of Prisoner of Azkaban) you would need to turn it 100,000+ times.  And, while the Potter murders were tragic, they brought Voldemort to heel and gave the world the boy fated to kill him once and for all.  If the Potters weren't murdered, Voldemort's power could have increased unchecked.  Also, there's no good reason for anyone to go back and witness Wormtail and Sirius' confrontation, because that case was closed.  It's not like they never caught anyone.  They had no reason to go back.  
Azkaban had never been broken out of before Sirius did it, and he was an unregistered Animagus.  The Death Eaters broke out because the dementors sided with Voldemort.  Going back in time wouldn't have helped at all with that.  And it would be massively impractical to go back and attempt to save every Auror who got killed in the line of duty.  You'd need a whole squad of time-traveling Aurors who don't mind living out the time they went back and aging prematurely.  
Finally, very few people knew that Tom Riddle was Voldemort, and even if they went back in time after he surfaced as Voldemort (around 30 years, so something like 300,000 turns of the Time-Turner) they'd have no evidence of wrongdoing.  He was a beloved student.  Teachers said that he was charming, intelligent and hard-working.  He covered up his murders and got people to confess to them.  It would be nearly impossible to convict him.
 Even if you could go back and fix everything, it would be massively impractical to do so, it could take years off your life if you went back far enough, and you can't know what the consequences of your actions will be if you do.
Not quite true. You are correct when you talk about treatments yes, as they move quickly. Same with hypothesised pathophysiology of diseases. However, in a simple prevalence/harm Comparison it definitely isn't. The damage that a drug does isn't going to change immensely over this period of time, except where it is due to a cultural practice, which has changed or a drug interaction where the drug is no longer available. 
Another unrelated example is anatomy, or even gene sequencing. In 9 years nothing will have changed. In 900 years not a lot will have changed even. Yet that is still medical research! 
true for drugs and stuff, not for this example. 
I find it hard to rationalize abortion without reaching the conclusion that animals share many of the traits we consider human and therefore should have some form of protection and basic rights, depending on the species.
Bear with me here. Abortion can't be rationalized without discussing the exact qualities a fetus lacks and a person has that disqualifies/qualifies them for legal rights. Most, if not all of the discussion hinges around consciousness and intelligence. Many higher mammals are conscious to one degree or another.  And tasty as bacon is, I find it hard to rationalize the consumption of pot-bellied pigs, which frequently exhibit mental and emotional qualities exceeding those of dogs.
Simply put, for purely cultural reasons we are conditioned to eat animals that easily exhibit all the qualities of a pet. **How is reconsidering our cultural conditioning on the basis of solid observations and existing moral reasoning any different from breaking free from culturally conditioned religious nonsense?**
See where this is going?
Animals share human characteristics.
I have done this. This does not work all of the time. Many places are becoming bull headed on raises, some are dumb enough to even take the hit when you have them by the balls...
Back in the day, it was easy. These days the best advice I have come across is to basically play hard ball with the employers. What you say is semi true, but you have to be smart about what responsibilities you take on. Taking on shit work is great for endearing you to the team, but if you take on work that no one else can replace you for, it gives you a much greater advantage when it comes to salary negotiations.
Edit:  Be smart about the responsibilities you take on.
Now let's back this ferrari up and take a better look at it to see if you should really "love it!!", shall we? The majority of the time, low grades can be traced back to one of two things: an intellect below what one's work demands, or apathy. 
In the case of the first we can't really hold it against them; they probably work their ass off and learned a lot. Even if their grades aren't great, they should still be proud.
In the case of the second we're allowed to be a little irritated. They got bad grades because they don't give a shit - this is either because they would rather be doing something else (drinking?) or because they know something is waiting for them on the other side. Something like a job with a six figure check and a new ferrari as a hard-earned graduation gift from daddy.
Which of these two groups is more likely to brag about their shitty grades, the one who worked their ass off but still underscored or the one who did nothing but is driving a ferrari? 
 CylonGlitch's wife's CEO is a douche, and we don't "love it!!".
There's lots of really legitimate things to be more concerned about in college than education. You are projecting your value system on to someone else and making assumptions based on really specious logic.
There are *thousands* of smart people on reddit who didn't give a damn about college (not because they have a rich daddy) and went on to be successful. A lot of them were really bright and were completely  turned off by the education system long before they got to college. Some of them are natural entrepreneurs (believe it or not, even today most rich folks are entrepreneurs). They went to college for the networking, to have a good time, or to please their parents. There are a dozen other stories that are far more common than the rich daddy handing over a six-figure job.
 Your eagerness to hate rich people is clouding your judgment.
Yeah, your anti-capitalistic rant will be real popular among the youngsters here on Reddit, but it is grossly over-simplified.
&gt; Let me reiterate, businesses are profiting more than ever while the middle class has been literally decimated to pay for it.
I am a partner in a small business. I can assure you we are not profiting more than ever while our employees are decimated to pay for it. What you are referring to is a handful of influential and massive corporations, many in finance. These corporations are not a byproduct of a healthy capitalistic market given their monopolistic nature and the many protections they enjoy through corrupting our government. If anything they are anti-capitalistic because they fear competition and demand subsidies and protections from the government.
&gt; Where is your beautiful correction? The next recession will purge the bad? Are you insane? This last recession in 2008 actually dramatically enriched businesses, who are enjoying their highest profits ever.
Mostly thanks to government bailouts and anti-competitive regulations coupled with unwise deregulations. And you are going to blame capitalism for that?
If you look past the Goldman Sachs of the world and down on the small business level (where we employ half the work force and account for 90% of new jobs created), you will see what made America great. You will also see poorly run businesses purged while strong ones (like my own) are actually growing. 
Capitalism is quite simply private ownership of capital. I am not arguing there should be no labor protections, environmental protections, etc. But I will argue that the government should never set wages and tell me how to run my business. In return, they should never be subsidizing businesses and trying to manage the market. A command system will never be fair or efficient: it will either inflate wages, which will yield to higher unemployment or it will run up massive debt (and yes, I agree that is better than unjust wars if you feel like raise such a strawman, but it is still not sustainable).
Even the so-called perfect Scandinavian countries that the Reddit hivemind adores are capitalistic. What I said applies to them all the same. Just because they employ more collective bargaining doesn't mean they aren't capitalistic, they still have entrepreneurs.
As far as having things like universal healthcare, to me that is a completely separate discussion from how a simple supply and demand market works. Almost all economists agree that trying to command it is a terrible idea - unless you work for the fed and you want the power.
&gt; No, I think you're sorely mistaken about capitalism, business, wages and recessions.
I am an entrepreneur and one of the drivers of this economic engine. I am not a massive corrupt corporation. I know what I need to succeed.
&gt; Capitalism is simple. Labor is another bottom line. Maximize profits by minimizing labor cost.
Yes, labor is a resource. I stil care about my employees / coworkers too. You can have both. It doesn't mean I am going to pay them more than they are worth, then I would be incompetent. To sustain a business, you have to treat labor as a resource. If you don't, then you will go under and then nobody has a job. How is that better?
I will pay them more if they bring more value. We have given employees raises by having them learn new skills and bring more value to the table. I will also pay them more if we are making excellent profits because I know they were drivers behind that. If I didn't do that, they would have compelling reasons to find another employer and show them their track record of productivity.
Other than government corruption, the main reason America's economy is becoming so shitty is lack of education and knowledge among the workers. 
First, we have various sectors of jobs that are desperate for good talent but it's just not there. It's a matter of skills. We've lost our blue collar jobs overseas, which would be fine if we actually had the education to match it. But we don't. So now you either work in a professional job (engineering, programming, law, business, medical) or you work in low-level service. We've got to fix that and we will be right back on track instead of sitting around demanding that the "greedy capitalists" pay you more. You are right that society has a problem, but it's not "private ownership of capital" or "supply and demand economics." That is what made America and the western world so innovative and with a high standard of living to begin with. That is not the problem. Corporatism and piss poor education is.
Second, it's this sense of entitlement among the youth without an ability to negotiate and sell. They want things handed to them and don't realize that they have the power to get what they want if they have the goods to back it up. If you and your coworkers are so valuable and talented and you think the owner of a company is exploiting you, then organize and do something about it. I probably made 20-50% more than all of my coworkers through my young professional life because I have made myself a valuable commodity and then forced employers to realize that. Now I am in my late 20s and a partner in a successful agency. I never had a rich family, I worked my way through college and paid for it myself.
I am not saying everyone can be like me. We need normal laborers. We need followers. By definition, the majority is going to be average. But many of the smart people are going to try and exploit the ignorant. We don't need a government to nanny us, we need to empower ourselves with knowledge. We also need to, as consumers, stop being so damn greedy and start supporting businesses we agree with. It's the people of a town that allows walmart to come in and destroy their economy because they want to buy more shit for themselves and don't care about the consequences. We need to bring back personal responsibility.
&gt; Because no one is forcing the capitalists to do it.
If you want the laborers to do the forcing through organizing and negotiating, I am in full support. If you want the massive, inefficient, corrupt government to do it, then you've lost me. They don't know what it takes to run my business, they can't even manage themselves. And they do it through force, which is immoral. I take on the risk and put in the long hours, so don't put a gun to my head and tell me what to do.
- Don't blame shitty circumstances in America on capitalism. Blame it on government corruption, poor education, and the ignorant masses that like their $0.99 cheeseburgers.
I was recently moved from a store-level position to a district-level position with my company because I have been working hard at my job for a long time. My old position was running a single lab. My new position is essentially the same in a day-to-day sense, but now I have to train any new employee at any of my district's stores that will be using the same machine as me. I got this raise because I have spent five years working with this machine and know it almost as well as the people who designed it.
**tl,dr**
Yes, we exist.
At the age of 21, I was in a bar with a cute bartender. The only way (I thought) to talk to her was to order drinks. I drank crown and 7 at a record pace that evening.
It's important to note that I remember as we walked into the bar seeing someone being "thrown out" quite literally by the bouncers. They were tossed into the street by their collar like you see in the movies.
It's also important to note that I was wearing a jacket inside the bar, as it was very cold outside.
I get so drunk I can't walk. It's a bar with several floors and I have no ideas where my friends are.
I get a case of "the spins". I never, ever puke when I drink - I'm a next day puker without fail. Tonight was different.
One of several 300+ lb bouncers was about 10 feet behind me. I feel the urge to vomit and, scared of being thrown out, I do the only thing I can think of.
I throw up down the sleeve of my own jacket.Repeatedly.
In my drunken stupor, I thought I was quite smooth. My friend tells me what he finally finds me and gets about 3 feet when the smell hits.
Him: "Dude are you okay"
Me: It's cool bro (gestures with arms)
As I make this gesture, vomit slings from my jacket sleeve like a homemade Spider-Man knock off. He laughs, rounds up my friends, and gets me outside.
I proceeded to take off most of my clothes in the 20 degree weather as I walked down through the local bar scene at 2 am.
I'm awesome
Threw up down my own sleeve, got semi naked in front of strangers

At universities in the uk, each hall of residence usually has a JCR (Junior Common Room) which is an elected committee that organises events.
I had been watching the rugby world cup in 2007 just after England beat Australia and was well and truly drunk. I had decided to run for vice chair of the JCR and the hustings coincided with the end of the rugby match.
About a week into university, knowing only about 15-20 I got up in front of my whole hall of residence (about 500) people including the staff and made a drunken idiot out of myself. Making bad jokes, laughing at my own jokes. Then when another person running for vice chair made a speech (a pretty overweight girl) I sat on the stage saying stuff like "don't vote for fat Isla". Needless to say, I didn't win. Some people thought it was hilarious but the majority thought it was the biggest car crash ever. I still cringe about it often. Thank god I've just graduated and won't have to look these people in the eye.
TL,DR: Got drunk before student committee hustings, made fool of self.
The moral of the story?  Call a cab...
About 7 years ago I was at the end of a 5 year relationship.  I had one last blow out argument with the exhole, and really needed a drink.  It was also 4th of July weekend, which I tend to enjoy.  So I called up a good friend, and he had me pick him up and we went to some bar that I had never been to.  I ended up blowing all my cash on beers, and then found my friend and asked if he was ready to split.  He had just gotten a fresh drink so I, in my happy beer mode, wandered back up to the bar.  Come to find out the bar only accepted plastic if you ordered over $10, so I ended up buying 2 daiquiris (they didn't sell beer at this particular counter).  Well I had never had a daiquiri before, and these in particular were made with some evil super strong grain alcohol meant to dull the senses of early 20ish college kids.  I tried to hand one of them off to my friend, but he wisely declined.  So, in a fit of defiance I downed both of them, and proclaimed that I was leaving.  My friend decided it best to get out of there as the TABC seemed to be rolling in the door.  (This bar had a tendency to "overlook" people being under age.)  
       
I wake up to a cold shower raining down on my half naked body.  I can't remember how I got there, and had never in my life up to this point "blacked out".  I get myself out of my shower, and think "at least I'm at home".  I stumble out of the bathroom, trying to determine who left me in the shower to die, and assess the situation.  Look out into the driveway to see if my truck is there, it's front bumper is FUCKED.  Awesome, never been blacked out, never been in an accident... so far having a great day.  My exhole is in the other room so pissed at me she won't even speak, which actually was a bit typical of her.  I thank her for leaving me to be passed out in the shower for what I can only assume was 6 hours.  She's an information blackout, so I call my friend and ask "wtf, last night, wtf?"  
      
Turns out I made it 3/4 of the way home, taking small back streets back to where I live.  At some point I lost consciousness, simultaneously vomiting on myself, all over the inside of my truck, and on my friend.  Most mere mortals would have bailed the fuck out of that situation at this point, but that night I learned the true nature of my friend.  He somehow got my half conscious body out of the drivers seat, we for some reason threw the street sign, pole and all, into the back of the truck, and he got in the puke covered drivers seat.  He struggled to drive a standard for the first time back to my house, thus evading one or both of us going straight to the fucking slammer.  He then, because my bitch ass exhole wouldn't deal with it, walked himself home about an hour.  
      
To this day when that horror comes back to me all I can think is, thank the universe that I didn't kill anyone.  I to this day do not drive after drinking that much, and try not to drink that much in the first place. I learned what it's like to black out, that yes beer then liquor witticism is true, and FUCK .... JUST CALL A FUCKING CAB... WHAT'S $20?
  Don't be a drunk fuck and drive.
Whenever I retell this story I can never tell if I need to feel embarrassed or not.
But it starts off with a night of drinking with friends. I was a newbie and I'm not very big individual. So I'm a light weight and I have no idea that I am one. I don't like beer, so I stick to hard liquor. Everything is going great. I don't have a care in the world, I have a designated driver and I'm becoming the life of the party. 
[Scene missing]
I wake up the next morning to find that I had puked over the side of my bed. But not only that, but I'm missing my pants. Dread begins to set in. Why can't I find them in my room?!? I play detective and use the trail of my personal belongs I left behind through the house. 32 oz soda and the bottom of the stairs. Wallet at the half way point on the stairs. And pants in the bathroom. Puke in the shower and I don't even dare look into the toilet. My phone still in my pocket filled with unintelligible messages.
Maybe not terribly bad, but it's the part where I don't know at what time I lost my pants in the bathroom. Was it all in one go, or did I make two trips. Which was first? The puke in the shower and then my ass explosion? Or where they both at the same time? And at what time? Before or after my roommate was up. My roommate also happens to be a quiet 40 year old Asian woman. Did I subject her to pantless vomiting me? Perhaps, I lucked out and still have my dignity. I don't know.
But what I do know now, is that I should watch what I drink and how much I drink of it. 
I woke up without my pants and probably subjected my roommate to me losing it at both ends.
This is a story I was actually thinking about earlier. Normally this isn't something I would do and I don't date someone because I am flattered. (I am a girl fyi)
It had been a month since I ended a my 2 year relationship and I ended up at a party with a bunch of people I had never met.
We were doing the usual, get drunk, play rock band and hang out when a guy shows up, in great shape, rather attractive and with a vibrant blue mohawk. Like this shit was neon blue, it practically glowed in the dark.
I had never met him before, but immediately it was like he was drawn to me, both of us had drank quite a bit and talked somewhat, but I wasn't really looking for anything, I was still dealing with the messy aftermath of my ex.
Anyways, he went for a smoke, someone needed a drummer for rock band so I hopped in and we played "Are you gonna be my girl" by Jet. I was half way through the song when mohawk guy whispers in my ear "Are you gonna be my girl."
Confused and in shock that someone as attractive as him was even in the slightest bit interested in me, I finished the song as fast as possible and went to hunt him down, but he was nowhere to be found, he had already left and I didn't even know his name.
I found his name from a friend and it turns out we worked at the same place I did(very big building) He actually hunted me down at work to talk to me, once again mind blown, he was clearly a 9.5/10 on the hot punk scale, but I wasn't really that interested.
He convinced me to come to the pool hall one night with his buddies we hung out some more and ended up seeing each other for a while. Well mostly just having really awesome sex. 
I wouldn't have dated him in any other situation, he was a smoker, he did some drugs and that just really isn't my life style, but it was what I needed at that time in my life, just some simple fling. We parted ways on friendly terms, he never once made any rules about anything, we just would show up, bang and say toodles.
If he hadn't have been so adamant in his pursuit, it wouldn't of happened, I pretty much just said "what do I have to lose?"
 met smoking hot guy, wasn't looking for a relationship or really that interested, but his adamant/passionate pursuit won me over 
I did. He seemed super cool and it was very flattering to discover he was into me.
After a couple of weeks, I realized that he only seemed so cool because he thought he was, and had somehow formed a group of friends that idolized him. But he wasn't that cool. If I had taken time to get to know him instead of being like, "Wow, HE likes ME???" I might have saved myself a boring couple of months full of bad sex that ended in him dumping me for another girl.
 It did not work out.
While I do agree that if you are not in some way challenged by your partner then it is not a good situation. You grow tired and bored with them. You can see their future and it is one that is plain, flat, and it reminds you of why you strive for more. That said, early spongebob was a real quality cartoon in a time where cartoons were being phased out by teeny shit. I am 20 myself and enjoy spongebob as well as many other quality cartoons from the 90s and early 2000s. Not for everyone I know, but still, good cartoons are nothing to shake your nose at.
I support your decision to leave the guy, especially if you were not happy. I would like you to give quality cartoons such as spongebob or even better, avatar: the last airbender. That is all
I once dated the hottest girl in the office for like three months because I couldn't figure out what she liked about me. 
I'm certainly not ugly, but I'm like a 6.8, and she was like a 9. I've been told I'm charming and funny, but I had hardly engaged this girl in conversation in the year I had known her before hand.
Anyways, I'm going to this party, and my friend tells me that this girl was like asking about me, and was super interested in me, and I just kind of blew him off, and then three or four other people at the party said the same thing.
So, I start talking to this girl, and it's going fairly well, and then I don't remember what happened, and then I nailed her at the party. Still, it didn't make any sense to me what she saw in me. So, we had great sex for a couple months, til I dumped her because she was as dumb as a box of rocks.
** Normal looking dude dumps hot chick who's totally into him. I got off track.**
When I first went to uni, I was the oposite of confident in the dating department; my high school was all-girls, and I hadn't hung out anywhere with many boys, so I'd never had anyone show interest in me before. Fast-forward to me joining wind-band, where this one guy kept following me around. I'd be talking with friends, and he'd appear just behind me. He complemented me a lot (very awkwardly), and would try to touch my shoulder. I was a bit uncomfortable, but flattered enough not to discourage him, which was enough. The band went on a retreat for a weekend, and he cornered me in a corridor and I couldn't see any way out of it, so we kissed. My first. He noted that no one was in the bunk room. I fled. He tried to corner me again later that night, touching me when I really didn't want me to, although he backed off when I said no. I didn't go back to wind band (which also meant not seeing most of my friends) for three months in fear of running into him; he called &amp; texted during that time, but eventually gave up.
 creepy dude flattered young!me enough to overlook creep factor; I regreted it.
the shoot down - or "shit test" - becomes a learned habit after constantly dealing with guys asking her out. They can't possibly give every single person a chance because that would take up all of their time.
 
TLDR natural selection at work; stop hatin' on nature, man.
This totally happened to me. A girl who I had gone to school with since I was 11 (she switched schools to my school) had confessed her love/lust for me shortly after she graduated high school (I had graduated a year ahead of her even though we were born the same year; I skipped a grade). 
I grew up not realizing that girls really existed until I was about 16, so I was not one who had dated many girls previous to her. She on the other hand had a couple boyfriends, generally I remember she would date guys for over a year during grade school (if you call it dating when your between the ages of 11-18).
So after her graduation, we were both 18, she was definitely more accustomed to dating, while I was inexperienced and awkward about it (I dated several girls, but couldn't seem to get past the "lets go see a movie or go bowling" phase, and even at the time couldn't say I ever had a girlfriend), and here I have her explaining how she knew I didn't date many girls and she would do almost anything if I would just take her to a movie so we could get to know one another. How could I say no?
I thought I had real chance at this whole "I have a girlfriend" thing. We dated for about 6 months, and I was actually comfortable, for the first time, as referring to someone as my girlfriend.
However, it did not at all work out. From day one, she already had her heart invested into me, and since she had just ended a longish term relationship, I did not at all have my heart invested into her. I liked dating her, but her need to see me once every several hours became a chore for me. 
I was also going through multiple major life crisis at this point (debating of going back to university for a second year, my parents were in the middle of a nasty divorce, my grand father just passed away, and my best friend was diagnosed with cancer) and finally just after news year she dropped the bomb that she was hurt that I was not able to see her and I was an emotional wreck that would not share my life burdens with her. 
So she broke it up with me; to this day (several years later), looking back I feel like I was an ass to her. She really wanted it to work out. She was the one to phone me and to say it, crying with her heart out on her sleeve, while I poker face shrug it off and awkwardly hung up only saying "oh okay".
*** I did not date much or ever had a girlfriend. Girl that I went to school with since elementary/junior high tells me she loves me after high school graduation. I hit it for about 6 months, then she breaks up with me because I was unable to see her every day, let alone multiple times a day like she wanted to. I feel like an ass still several years later.
yup my only relationship with a girl who I asked out just cuz she spent a lot of time with me. I didn't like her for a couple months when we hung out as friends. But she kept coming back. I asked her out and we went out for 2 years in which I fell stupidly and blindly for her to the point that I idolized her and convinced myself that she was too good for me and started telling her that, acting like a depressed idiot. obviously, she lost her interest in me, causing us to grow apart. I asked her to give me more attention like she used to when we got together and she said no. we ended up breaking up. In a month or so I started realizing what I did and went back to her to tell her i don't need more attention, lets get back together. begged her for a good 2 months. she said no. gave up begging. stayed madly in love with her missed her for like next 3-4 months. And then after that I started realizing well I didn't do anything to get her. I am actually a cool person, and if I try I can get someone a lot better, who actually would try to keep me happy. I won't have to beg her to give me a handjob that I finish myself cuz I feel bad that it took too long, and not have to eat her out unless she shaves. I won't be so retardedly in love with someone to think they are better than me.  
 we went out for 2 yrs, we broke up (I think she dumped me, she doesn't). I feel like it was a mistake going out with someone who you don't completely like initially
I think you misunderstood what 'shit test' normally means. It's a way of ensuring a guy she's becoming attracted to is not a weak emotionally insecure pansy. It's actually a sign she's interested in you, not an outright dismissal.
 Females are confusing.
Fight Club reference aside, I find that mentality toxic. Most people are pretty decent people. The most unappealing thing about the people who beat themselves like that is well...the fact that they beat themselves up like that and, as a result, don't have any confidence.
A lot of men just need help believing that they are worthy of female attention, and that they are good enough to be choosey.
Even if someone isn't interesting or worthwhile, a bit of confidence is generally what it takes for them to go out and make themselves interesting. Faking confidence works beautifully too. If you fake it enough, eventually it'll become natural.
Shit like that quote encourages a lot of negative thinking that can be very destructive to a guy's confidence and self-worth. Most women love confident (not cocky!) men, so believing that you aren't wonderful and worthwhile is really limiting, as far as dating is concerned anyway.
Fuck your face
yeah. co-worker. bad idea.
she was into me, and made it clear by giving me a handjob underneath a blanket whilst we watched a movie with our other co-workers. rode along with it for about a week, then realized the strange group dynamics that were emerging within our social circle. also realized she was really into me, and that i may have been leading her on. ended it right then and there. bitterness and resentment have followed in its wake.
 be careful with people's feelings, especially if you work with them!
yes, actually, it happened today. this gurl was throwin a party and invited me and my friends, since she knows all of us and vice versa. sadly, i just got busted by my parents with my bong and pot (just got a new spacecase grinder, had $250+ bong and a $180 attachment that i JUST got, maybe one use with the attachment) so i sadly cudn't mkae it out for the whoel thing, and just felt like chillin instead of goin to a party that was goin to be raided (alot of houses really close and cops are always patrolling). last nite she messaged me askin if i was goin to go, i told her sadly i don't think so but i wish i cud show my appreciation for inviting me (i was horny at the time and was browsing NSFW on here and lookin a pornhub so my brain turned off and my balls turned on), long story short, we got to talkin about sexy-time and how she wished i cud come to the party basically to fuck (i forgot to mention she is very nice, but not the most attractive gurl in my eyes. my friends think she is decent but idk not to me), i was flattered by all of it that i asked if she cud hang earlier today, she said yes and we set it all up. dawn came and i realized i didnt want to fuck her, my balls were talkin for me, but i was so flattered that she went out of her way to bring all this up that i said fuck it, atleast its practice for college in the fall, so i went to her house and did wat had to be done. now the sword is sheathed and all is good between balls and brain.
i was asked to fuck by a gurl i wud normally fins unattractive, but since i was horny i accepted. i realized when i calmed down that i didn't wanna fuck but decided to go in anyways
EDIT: by "flattered" i mean horny
yes, kind of...
I was in highschool, and obsessed over one boy (he turned out to be not my type at all as he grew up but i'll never forget lol). Another boy, who I honestly could not find anything a) in common with b) attractive about him whatsoever c) anything nice about his personality asked me out. Apparently he had this huge crush on me. I felt so wracked with guilt I said yes. I was fat, unnattractive, and lonely. I thought I could convince myself otherwise. After 3 dates and him (shorter and wider than me) pinning me against a wall in a busy mall to try to kiss me (I was sexually assaulted when I was a child, this did not sit well) I decided the best way out of the relationship was to act like I was completely ditsy (he was attracted to my geekiness/intellect or so he said). It forced him to "break up" with me. we agreed to be friends, and I rescinded my acceptance to go to prom with him. Instead I went with my obesession, which resulted in me going home on the bus at 3am because he was getting high and it wasn't my thing (looking back i wish i had the guts to have tried it lol). Worst part? guy who i wanted no part of - now a lawyer, and married, guy i was obsessed with - as far as i know, countless sexual liaisons. me? living with my 1st real boyfriend (i don't count that guy as having ever been a bf as the feelings were not returned from the first day), and still in grad school. 

**tldr** went on 3 dates with a guy I wasn't in to because I felt guilty and ugly, screwed it up by acting insane, he gets last laugh (without ever knowing)
Yes, and it was honestly one of the oddest things I've ever done. I've never been too much into casual flings, but I'm out of college soon and the opportunity for that stuff will soon be dying out. I digress. Ps - throwaway.
She was always a super nice, extremely attractive and intelligent. She quite literally had everything going for her that I would find attractive and typically arouse some sort of relationship interest, except one. She was *too* into me. We flirted with the idea of dating in high school, but it fell through. mostly due to some post-relationship heartbreak. That didn't stop her though, she tried her heart out. I'm talking showed up to my high school grad party uninvited (didn't mind, but was odd), she'd always make obvious comments about us having a future and that I'd have to get used to a woman who'd spoil the hell out of me, etc. 
We've remained friends through college and finally not too long ago, she convinced me to try it out casually. She goes to college a few hundred miles away, so it hampered it happening up to this point. It took her four years of literally throwing herself at me, but she finally reached her "goal" so to speak. 
The actual experience wasn't bad, she was pretty primal and I've got to say it was one of the hottest things I've ever experienced. She was also into forced submission (pinning her arms above her head so she could try to fight back and fail, etc), which was new to me, but also a pretty big turn on. We both have SO's at this point in time, so I don't think it will ever happen again, though I wouldn't mind it if the opportunity arises and we're single.
- Girl chased me for 4 years, finally gave in, [Rick James]( , we've moved on with our lives, wouldn't mind it again.
I'd broken up with my girlfriend of a year because she couldn't get it through her head that it wasn't okay to go out drinking with friends (without me) and then to stick your tongue down the throat of said friends.
There was a girl who was VERY cute, and very sweet, but not much on reading, or much of anything else that makes one curious about life. She had enormous breasts that defied gravity, and she was so tiny that you could theoretically fuck her in the back of a volkswagon and she might not hit her head on the ceiling (or so I would imagine in my head as she flirted with me).  And boy did she flirt with me. 
I'd come out of class and she'd be there waiting in the lounge. I'd be sitting at a piano practice room and she'd come in and twirl her hair.  I think she finally got tired of waiting for me to ask her out (I wouldn't have, because I suspected we had less than nothing in common, despite my curiosity about the validity of my VW headroom theory) and one day she stood in the doorway of a classroom, wearing a miniskirt and a belly shirt, and asked me if I wanted to go see a movie that weekend.
My cock said yes, and so it was set.
We got to dinner and as I'd feared the conversation was on a respirator from the start. I'd try to ask her things on which most people have opinions, and she'd shrug and smile. She'd ask me almost nothing throughout the night, and at some point I realized I just needed to try to enjoy the view and not hope for much in the way of sparkling personality.
The check came, and I reached for it (fully expecting some kind of playful fight about it, because that's what people DO now) and she let me have it.  No comment. No reach. She just let me pay, even though she asked me out. Okay. Cool. I'm fine with that.
We head to the movies, and she says, "Let's go see You've Got Mail!" 
Joking around, and hoping for another flick, I said, "Didn't you see that when it was called 'Sleepless in Seattle?'"
Blank stare...
So we went to see You've Got Fucking Mail.  And when we got to the ticket counter, she walked up to it, said, "Two for You've Got Mail," and then stood aside looking back at me, smiling.  I paid, and then we went in, made lame conversation again before the flick and then suffered through Tom Hanks at his most inane, and Meg Ryan pre-duckface-collagen.
So the movie ends, and I'm thinking, "Get this girl out of my car.  I'm done."  But my dick is thinking, "WTF?  You paid for this date you didn't want to go on. We better see those gravity-defying titties, mother fucker! This is NOT negotiable!"
So we drive back to her car, and she sticks her tongue down my throat. Not only is she stupid hot, and just stupid, she kisses like Natasha Henstridge in Species. I decide to go for the shirt. She moans a little, and even in the dark I see she's opted for the leopard print bra. I bury my face and get to work, and when I've got her moaning a lot, and rubbing on her jeans, she's humping my hand and she seems to come.  And THEN!  She says, "I should get going.  I don't want to go too far tonight. Call me and we can go out again."
HAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA  
Not even if she paid. I had just gotten out of a relationship with crazy smart, and just plain crazy.  To go on another date with a pair of dumb tits was not going to happen.
 - Fuck you.  Read the fucking story, it's not like anyone will see it in this pile, so be a champ and read.  There's tits in it somewhere.
"So i met this girl at a party and she was pretty hot so i asked her out. It was pretty fun at first but after a while she didnt really seem that into me, which is weird because i am fucking awesome.
I know the sex was good, because i have a huge penis. Not in terms of girth, but length, so while i cant actually stimulate the g-spot or anything, i can pound a cervix like no ones business, which is exactly what chicks want. And i just dive right in because i know how chicks hate foreplay.
But then luckily my long-time best friend got dumped by his girlfriend of several years at that time, and she is pretty hot, so after a respectful mourning period of about a week, i hooked up with her. Its not really cheating cause i dumped aladyredditor the next day. Totally worth losing my best friend over too, because now im with his girl and she takes care of me while im not working or in school.
 worked out great."
Im guessing it would go about like that.
So um, that sounds great, but speaking as a software engineer, that's not actually how bugs (or in particular fixing bugs) works.  If they found a bug, particularly a critical bug, then it's not like they can just "release everything else while they fix it."  Assuming that they even know where the bug is, making the code-change to "leave that part out" could easily introduce even more bugs.
  probably silly to try to second guess their decisions when they have a lot more experience with their codebase, and access to all the details.
Can't believe I haven't seen this in this thread yet. Before you go out drinking or take your first drink, take a vitamin B complex and Vitamin C supplement. I don't have the proof, but I've been told that the Vitamin B interacts with a byproduct of drinking produced by your liver, neutralizing it. It is the chemical that causes the headaches, nausea, aches, etc. If you do this, all you have to worry about is the dehydration, which has been covered by others.
- take Vitamin B and C before your first drink.
&gt;So was it ok to not eat very much since I wasn't hungry, or should I be eating more to replenish my macronutrients? If it makes any difference I'm going for fat burning/weight loss right now.
If weight loss is your goal, I would limit the protein shakes (whey?), milk, and chocolate syrup.  Eat clean (read: real foods) for a few weeks without these (and drop any other non-paleo foods), and see how your performance/weight loss improves.
Weight loss isn't a formula, you can't accurately count the number of calories you consume/burn and figure out how many pounds you will lose.  A simplistic calories in = calories out formula ignores the different energy pathways of the macronutrients (Protein, Fat, and Carbs).  The formula doesn't take into account the hormonal responses to these macronutrients.  If it sounds like I'm angry, I'm not, I just feel strongly about this.
I'm guessing that the reason you feel full is the insulin spike from the sugar in the milk (lactose, maltose) and chocolate syrup (sucrose/HFCS) along with the protein content of the shake.  Protein is a powerful satiating macronutrient, and so is an insulin spike...  both of these tell your brain that you have eaten enough food, at no point does your body tell your brain that you ate 487 calories, so calories consumed is irrelevant at this point.  Insulin is a double edged sword, it tells your brain that you have eaten when it spikes, but when it crashes (shortly after bingeing on chinese fried rice, for instance), your brain gets panicked and goes into hunger emergency mode, crashing insulin tells your brain that you are starving.
TL:DR; It sounds like you posted to the wrong Reddit, I thought you might subscribe to the calories in vs calories out fallacy, and I suggested to cut the sugar if you want to see weight loss.
I may be able to shed some light on this.
I was unemployed for about 5 months, around month 2 a friend suggested I check out food stamps. Not only did it take about an hour to get signed up, they only ask that you check in every 6 months. I got a job and let them expire and they sent me a healthy 10 notices about how I may still be eligible and I should come re-apply. In the end it's just another Gov. program whose funding is determined by how much "need" there is for it. Kind of like when police write a bunch of BS tickets at the end of the month to prove how much they are "needed" in the community...
This being said, some people do need it, I did for a few months, the issue is not the program, but the system in which it operates. i.e. our Gov.

- the food stamps program receives more funding the higher the number of people using them gets and is set up to be real, real easy to get on and stay on.

&gt; There is a strong prejudice against men when it comes to children. Why? I don't know.
YOU DON'T KNOW???
Holy shit. It's because for the past few thousand years the patriarchy has whored off all paternal responsibility to women. They've drilled into our brain so much "Women should be the mothers because they're good at that emotional shit!" that in this modern day and age, it flips in the brains of those stuck in gender roles as "Men should not be the fathers because they're really shitty at that emotional shit"
So really, you have to team up with the feminists who wanna remove gender roles (not the pro-gender role ones or the matriarchal ones) if you want to push pro-fathering, because right now the Men's Rights' movement view point of either "women suck" or "women are empowered through their symbiotic relationship in their gender role ann coulter back in the kitchen bullshit" is actually fueling the "all men are pedos" attitude. 
Horrible Bosses was hilarious. I tried to watch Bridesmaids with my girlfriend, and about halfway through I decided I had to leave to "go to the bathroom." I actually just wanted to leave for a few minutes because my brain was chewing its way out of my skull. I was in such a hurry to leave I actually got a moderately sprained ankle (the kind that hurts for a few months) when I mis-stepped going down the stairs.
 Twisted my ankle because I hated Bridesmaids. 
Girlfriend thought it was hilarious though, so your mileage may vary.
Maybe I'm biased, but I have collected a 6" binder filled with incidents of police doing things like entering the wrong house, shooting innocent people... etc.  Check out /r/badcopnodonut.

Never stop watching a caster you enjoy.  Understand however what you're getting from a cast.  Day9 is the obvious resource for discussing the metagame, and understanding the fundamentals of Starcraft.  Tastosis basically brings the high level play and packages it up nicely for us.  You can also watch streams, which have pro player interaction with the fans.  I've talked a little with Artosis on his late night stream, Spanishiwa before he got eFamous (although I'm pretty sure he hasn't changed!), and even Catz long ago.  You could usually ask a quick question regarding a particular matchup to get a reliable answer.  
Depending on what your endgame is...you have many options for you.  What race do you play?  What are you most interested in learning?  For me watching how Destiny has evolved (basically early Destiny was like playing on XBox Live, and todays Destiny is more serious about the game) has really been a major reason why I keep watching him.  Also he has a much better taste in music than a lot of the streamers.  He also streams often, and he plays a consistent form of Zerg which I associate better with.  Find the qualities of how you like to play and then watch a stream where that player plays like you (but at a high level).  Basically it could validate some of the thoughts you may have on the game.  Also try watching a GSL stream or another type of stream where the observer is moving and you can make judgements on what's going to happen.  When you start becoming consistent with predictions on how matches start unfolding this will also help with your own play.  Specifically for me I was watching a lot of the GSL and observing TvZ where T were going quick hellions to force a zerg roach response and following up with cloaked banshees which controlled the movement of the roaches to give the hellions a greater effect on their harass (moving roaches off a ramp to get hellions in main, killing queens to keep hellions  close to expansions so zerg weren't mining off their expansion, and getting Terran even further ahead for the mid-&gt;late game transition).  You could play a lot of games to see this type of scenario, or just watch a lot of games and think "if this happens to me what should the appropriate response be?".
 Pick what's important to you and focus on the streamers/youtube/leagues that provide you with this.  There is the educational sc2 vs. entertaining sc2, and a whole lot in between.
A legit article.While I agree completely with the article, what do y'all think about so called "conscientious carnivores"? 
Do you think this "conscientious" movement is leading people to consider where their food comes from and ultimately eat less meat? Almost path like in leading them towards vegetarianism and so on?
  Or do you see it as more of a shallow form of "activism" or action that is simply providing a "moral" cop out for omnivores that is inhibiting the movement and leading to stagnation? 
Do you think it's hurting or helping the movement? 
"I dont believe im depressed, but i have a lack of motivation for life for some time now."
You're contradicting yourself.  You say you're not depressed, but you have no motivation/interest in life and constant recurrent thoughts of suicide.  Depression is not the same thing as just being sad or feeling down.  Depression is being completely apathetic - not caring whether you live or die, at times crying hard for absolutely no reason, etc.  Unfortunately, isolation (i.e. "loner") only fosters depression (I too was a "loner").  I strongly suggest that you get in touch with a mental health counselor, psychologist, or a psychiatrist.  
- You sound like you have depression; Please get help immediately.
If you want to discuss the cutting-edge fashion and post pictures of [Nick Wooster]( all up in here, that's totally fine. It will certainly liven the place up. 
However, the big advantage of MFA over some place like Style Forum is that this is practical fashion that real people can attain, and much of that is built around classic staples. The delta between the average neckbeard on reddit vs. the prevailing style of MFA is much larger than the difference between the average poster on MFA vs. Style Forum. Perhaps you'd find more of the avante garde cutting-edge fashion you're looking for there. 


 MFAers most likely need to kop some basic captoe balmorals before they get a pair of glittery Duckie Brown longwings died in period blood. 




ninja edit: That's not to say MFA is not without its faults. The shoulders are always too big on that jacket. Those pants are always too baggy. WTF...that's not selvedge denim. Those shoes are always too casual for a suit. You should always have a 14 shoe rotation of $300 shoes. Shoe. Trees. Everywhere.

There will always be a place for a full on js person. You forget the sheer amount of js a large corporation manages. The idea of a person taking care of one part of a stack of technologies is not only common, but in many cases the way a team might split themselves optionally if given the change.
The web requires that people be a jack of all trades, but if you get those people in one group, often times the skillsets skew heavily towards one part of the stack or another.
Never fear, people will love you even if you can't design/hate css/wouldn't want to test your stuff on people... Just be prepared to take lots of constructive criticism, as the needs of the end user might be a lot more work than what you'd be able to do if you "just did it this way instead" and as a straight js person you won't be immersed in that side.
tl:dr, yes, go get a design/ux buddy in a large corp, make lots of cash
Jack Kerouac spent 7 years on the road. He wrote "On The Road" in 3 weeks on a single roll of paper. 
He was not a professional writer. But, he had a story to tell. 
He was not rationalizing his life decisions in writing.  He was not telling a story about himself. He was telling a story about the world his decisions led him to, who they him led to, and perhaps in so doing, why he was led to make them in the first place.
 Don't write a story about yourself. Its boring.
Verizon has the best coverage but, Sprint is nearly identical. AT&amp;T has the worst coverage, especially on the outer islands. Verizon is the most expensive, AT&amp;T is up there as well.

Granted, you've played with me so you already know if you want me or not for this one; regardless, here's my life history for review anyway:
-Balance Druid, will someday hit #1 spot on dps, even if I have to form my own guild to do so.  Everything went according to plan with achievement points.  I'm willing to swap to resto if needed, which would be an easy move since all my gear overlaps except for trinkets.
-*ninja edit: 367 average, but I'm logged in on my pvp gear so it says 365 equipped.  wtf.  Dammit Niwa.*
-I've been in every raid except Ruby Sanctum and the first Naxx (not necessarily completed them, oh well).  I'm talking about running them during max level during their times, and not 85 run-throughs.  I learn mechanics quickly, which I consider my strength.  My goal for wipes is to be the last person alive haha.  Let's see, oh yeah, I've played resto for all Wrath content, so I'm not too rusty doing that, otherwise I've been dps.  I'm not too fond of the idea of tanking as a bear, since pally tanking = the bomb.
Other notes:  I won't get butthurt if I'm not accepted into this first raid, as long as it's for a good reason haha.  If I suck, tell me, and I'll improve.  If that fails, I'll gladly bow out.  Most importantly, I bring an easy-going attitude - the game is about fun.  I do not do good in "hardcore" raiding due to the angry nerd rage over vent; I'd rather be in the fail-raid that's having fun (although I would like to see some progression haha).  If I can't play Pink Fluffy Unicorn videos over mumble, then there's a problem lol.
 I swear to god if you take Rahmrod over me I will punch you in the face
quickedit:  My "ideal" playtime is 4:30pm to 10pm.  I can still make the time listed above, but would like to throw out a possible starting time of 6pm server.
Also: Ideally, what date would this start?
This is strange timing. I have a player that's doing this right now. I just allowed him to multiclass to monk, despite the alignment restrictions. We've decided his history is that he has this sort of primal ANGER that overcomes him some times. He eventually meets a old monk who begins to train him and get it under control, and channel it at the right times. So I really hope your GM reconsiders his stance on the alignment restriction.
But "Animal Fury" the extra Bite attack rage power, really made him feel... gritty, and not like your normal Monk. I'm changing the "Brawler" rage power to increase his unarmed strike damage by one more dice level instead of just giving him a d6 damage (which would actually be lower). And the "Ground Break" and "Elemental Rage" rage powers seem like they'll do wonders to this archetype. 
If your GM doesn't allow you to cross class there's going to be some new stuff that sounds promising for you coming out in the Ultimate Combat book arriving some time in the next couple weeks. Ultimate Combat should have some good Unarmed based feats, and if you can't cross class into Monk then do so into Fighter. There's going to be two new Fighter Archetypes that sound promising for your character, "Brawler" and "Unarmed Fighter". 
Until then, ask if your GM will allow you to take Improved Natural Attack and/or Multiattack (monster feats) after you take Improved Unarmed Strike, this should help out a good deal in raising your unarmed damage to Monk levels. 
- I hope your GM lets you cross class into Monk despite the alignment issues. 'Animal Fury' is a must. If Monk cross classing is a no-go, ask about Improved Natural Attack and Multiattack. If all else fails, buy time until the "Ultimate Combat" book comes out which should have some neat stuff for you.
I switched to the Zune when I had my iPod stolen. I was getting annoyed with iTunes right before it got stolen. My roommate had a Zune and it intrigued me enough to try it out. I fell in love with the player and the UI on the actual device. It looks clean and is very easy to navigate.
yes switch.
I...I don't think a single female has posted in this thread. 
So hi, I'm a girl. Honestly, if you're getting "the vibe," she's probably interested. 
Edit: It seems like you guys are looking for a formula. "If a girl does this and this, it's a sure thing! Go for it!" What I'm trying to say is that there isn't a formula. Different girls will do different things in different situations. The only thing that will remain a constant is the general feeling (*cough* vibe) a girl will put out there in her actions for the guy to pick up on. Yes, wonderful, you're not telepathic, we know. The thing is that we will do something in a flirty style. (Based on other comments, you guys DO pick up on this, but are unsatisfied with it because it isn't a 100% guarantee. Girls are just as scared to put themselves out there as guys, so please don't expect anything would make it that obvious. We don't want to get rejected either, which is why we resort to subtle hints.) Touching your hair doesn't mean anything by itself, but if a girl does it in a flirty way, then it does. 
Don't focus as much on *what* a girl does, but instead on *how* she does it.
This is something I struggle with myself. Personally I like to use hypothetical situations to challenge myself on this issue to see where it leads. More often than not I just realise that there is no black and white on this at all. 
Essentially I ask myself that if my life depended on someone killing, right there and then in front of me, a perfectly healthy chimp would I be ok with that? What if it was a dog? Or "just" a mouse? What if it was a loved one instead of me? What if it would just cure me of a horrible but non life-threatening illness? What if it was another terminally ill patient that couldn't be helped instead of an animal that would be killed? The answer is ... I just don't know. It's a very simplistic situation but I think a reasonable analogy IF you consider every life, human and non-human animal alike, to be important in itself. Which I do, whether it's an immediate killing for myself only, or study in a lab for the benefit of many.
I've found many articles talking about judging, when you need to, the relative loss of experiences that will occur from a particular action, which I think is sort of more fair to the animals in question than judging how much suffering there will be. Essentially to put value on the life of the animal as well as it's death. It is debatable but perhaps it could be said that the continued experiences of a healthy human are somewhat richer and more "valuable" in the world than that of a healthy dog, and both more so than that of a mouse. However how you extend this fairly arbitrary and human derived scale to judge between the experiences of a healthy chimp against those of a whatever number of current and potential sufferers of a disease I don't know either. It really begs the question though of why we never consider weighing one person's life (even if that person is terminally ill or comatose or maybe just a bit stupid) against a number of others' whose experiences might be richer? This utilitarian type view is just so damn hard to quantify and full of so many potential ethical holes. Where you draw the line becomes very very subjective.
Ultimately and ideally the only way to ever be truly consistent is to treat each life, no matter what species, as absolutely sacred and not to be taken in favour of ANY number of others unless consent has been absolutely given. Unfortunately that is so much easier said than done (not least because animals can't give consent) and few people would be arguing against taking one unconsenting adult life in favour of, say, a hundred babies in an emergency (like the hypothetical train track problem). Yet we'd still find it hard to justify it outside of an emergency, which I find quite interesting because what actually changed? How the hell though do we fit animals into such a shifting and unreliable scale when the type of animal, the nature of the disease, the number of beings involved, the immediacy of the situation and any other number of factors effects where our own personal and subjective moral compass will point? We have a hard enough time weighing these things when it's just one species involved, and I think that's really a large part of the problem. It's just plain hard. 
Basically there is no easy answer as far as I see it, but what is clear to me is that ALL (no matter how extreme) steps should be taken to find and use alternatives to using any kind of animal. Only then can we even entertain justifying the use of utilitarian thinking in any given situation, and when it is used the rights of an animal should never be automatically dismissed over a human's. The thing I like is that humans are, as far as I'm aware, unique in being able to make such considerations through our advanced sense of empathy, and I think we should celebrate and nurture that form of thinking more and more. Sometimes it's worth considering that the life of a mere mouse might just be more important than any number of humans suffering an illness. 
Dont worry it's just word vomit. 
This really should be reported to the card issuer/acquiring bank.  You could also notify Visa/Mastercard/Whomever is the final authority for your card.
While there is a lot of debate around the regulation, card processors are required to meet a specifically defined level of compliance in order to accept and process credit card payments.  A breach of any sort is built-in proof that they are not meeting compliance requirements.
- report this to your card issuer and ask about investigation options.
I somewhat disagree with your post.
While I acknowledge the current system is not the ideal way to ensure that the best players are always the ones who do well, I also feel that tournaments are misbranded as being used to establish who is the best of a pool of competitors. I believe that the GSL being the only major tournament in Korea further forces this misconception. I also think there is a lot of entertainment value in the potential for upsets.
Now, having said that, I believe the true problem is that there are not more tournaments in Korea, I feel it really hinders the game's growth there, and hopefully Blizzard will settle their differences with KeSPA and the players will have more competition to participate in.
Still, putting that aside, I think your opinion is valid in the context of their being only one tournament (Working with what we have, if you will).
 I think more tournaments would be the ideal situation, barring that I agree with you.
i've always been told "a broken watch is always right twice a day." as well as "any given sunday.." - both these quotes translated for this situation: even the best players lose on occasion.
shit happens in any tournament or in any league in any sport (march madness, anyone?)- you hit a patch of good luck, you win one close game, you have one good play/build work out EXACTLY as planned or the OPPOSITE of how it was planned. its the nature of the game - anything can happen.
the Code-B system has great players that deserve a spot in the GSL and you know what GOM is doing to get them back in it? they're sending all of the players that SHOULD be in the GSL to MLG to earn their spot back. Boxer, DRG, MMA are the 3 i can think of, with MVP as the all around "duh" choice to send as well. those 3 (4) can easily make it to the finals and earn their spot(s) back.
- you win some you lose some, that doesn't mean the system is broken because someone beat a player that should have advanced with a cheese, all-in, or build order counter - that's that nature of the game.
Indeed there is. By top heavy, I mean the top 4 finishers receive a staggeringly high portion of the total prize pool. In this short-term, this is a good strategy for generating buzz about a tournament, establishing legitimacy, and attracting viewers. But in terms of creating a source of income that can sustain players, it's a very poor system. And of course, you can make the argument that it is not their goal to sustain players, I understand that. However, in the long run, I think it's better for the sports development if a higher percentage of players can support themselves through what they win.
It's easiest to visualize things through extremes sometimes. So just imagine that instead of a winner each month for gsl getting money, there is only one prize a year for 500,00$. The winners of each GSL play eachother at the end of the year for it. 
Now the other scenario. Everyone who participates in each GSL gets an equal amount of the prize pool. Every qualifier earns as much as the champion. 
The first scenario is better for sheer excitement. Every round is win or be completely eliminated with zero compensation. However, no one in their right mind would ever consider being a professional starcraft player if this was the case. People would compete, they would even train hard, and undoubtedly people would watch, but there wouldn't be the mass of pro's and tryhards that are out there now. It could never be called a sport.
Then there is scenario 2, the egalitarian approach. This system is also flawed. It would foster a large number of professional players who could expect to be rewarded for their time, but the tournament would be a dull event. Few people outside of diehard fans would tune in if there were no difference between who won and who lost from the ro64 onward.
The system that is needed is one that will balance these two. The system in place looks much closer to the first extreme than the second and so is more likely bring about the flaws of the top-heavy scenario.  A more linear distribution of prizes would maintain the escalating excitement as the tournament progresses while still allowing monthly participants to focus solely on Starcraft as their livelihood.
For reference GSL 1 prizes were as follows:
64= 260$
32= 430$
16= 1700$ 
8= 3400$
4= 8600$
2= 25k
winner= 85k
  I go on and on and on and on, etc., etc., etc., and so forth, and to infinity and beyond, and the green grass grows all around all around the mulberry bush the monkey chased the weasel.......
yeah i guess that makes sense, but my argument doesnt necessarily use that one example as the foundation. instead, i tried to generalize it to fit my perspective and used MMA as an example in my own argument. i didnt say mma definitely deserves to be in code S or code A because of his win at mlg or his seeming lack of skills. i plainly said (or at least tried to) that although he may have won mlg, that shouldnt be the deciding factor as to whether or not some deserves a spot in a different tournament. rather, the deciding factor should be his performance at the specific moment when qualifying for said tournament
 winning one tournament does not necessarily mean you deserve a spot in different tournament, let alone one in an entirely different environment
My father has had MS for almost 20 years. It's affected him pretty badly, his left arm is the only thing he can really use other than his head.
 Smoking Marijuana helped cope with a lot of things. It generally lifted his spirits and helped him go to the bathroom (take a hit while on the jon).
It did have its negatives. It would impair his physical abilities even more, make him absent minded for hours after, and of course, gave him the munchies. Eating too much can quickly become a big problem if your incapable of exercising. Also, it's illegal here in Virginia.
Some of the best times we had lately were sitting on the porch smoking a bowl and going for a stroll together.
My father has MS, and marijuana helped him a lot, but it was by no means perfect. 
I would be wary of trying to follow any specific builds once you get to about 20 pop, mostly because it's really easy to mess up. 
For example - let's suppose that you memorize loads of timings for tech etc based on what pop you have, so e.g. 16 pylon, 17 core, 22 assim, 24 pylon and so on. Now let's say that you make a mistake and lose a stalker early on. 
Now, you're on 2 pop less than you should be, and so have to factor all of that in to your pop counts. 
Now, you might forget a worker, or chrono boost the wrong building. This makes you even more behind your build, and you have two choices: you can either remove three from all the numbers in your build and go ahead with it anyway, or you can wait until you have the extra pop back up to the build that you've memorized, and then carry on. This could delay the build by up to 40 seconds, e.g. if you have to rebuild a stalker. 
I would recommend just playing games, and working on spending money. Constantly make builders (unless you plan on going all-in), and then just make as many units as you can, making as many production buildings as you can afford. 
Going crazy and thinking about a plan is all well and good, but don't get confused when someone says that. When someone says "have a plan", then don't mean something like: Harrass with X units to cover this tech, expand to this location and then push at this point to gain map control etc.
What they mean is literally something like: I want 3 bases, and to have colossi. 
Then, you can go into a match, and think: OK. That's my aim. How do I get there? Well, I can make a robotics facility, and then make a robo bay, and start making colossi. What don't I need? I don't need stargates, or forges, or twilight councils. So let's not make them. 
Then, you come out of the match and watch the replay, and look for things like: Did I have any *dumb losses*? By that, I mean something like: Did I lose too many units because my army was out of position? Did I lose because I forgot to check if he had another base? Did I have all my zealots at the back of my army, and so he killed me with roaches and lings early on? Did I screw up my forcefields?
After you've gotten rid of that, go through the entire match and check if you were constantly making builders (up to 75 or so). If you weren't, try to fix that. If you were, then work out when you had loads of unspent money. Say something like: I had 200/150 unspent at 8 minutes in the game. Is there a point when I could have squeezed out a sentry from my gateways? If so, then how do I make sure that I do that (e.g. was I spending chrono boost properly)? If I was making stuff from my production buildings all the time, then did I need another pylon? Could I have dropped my robotics facility faster?
Repeat this, and keep on going on at it until the only problems you find are micro ones (e.g. dumb losses.) Then you're ready to be a professional SC2 player :D
Tl-DR: 
Watch this daily. I cannot stress it enough. Watch it.


If you have a job that is making less than minimum wage with the benefit of tips, the company spends less money on you, and the customers have the choice of how much they pay you. It is a win-win on both sides, and you're the sucker allowing it to happen. People don't spend extra money if they don't have to, even for the really hot ones they want to call them. If they did, the restaurant could just charge more for the food, and if they are nice, increase your pay to something worthwhile. If there's anyone you should be mad at for your "I need tips to survive" position, it should be the company/industry for which you slave. The customer is the one being put into a position to pay your wages when it shouldn't be the customer's responsibility.
Now, before all the waiters and waitresses start freaking out on me, I'm a VERY generous tipper because I know that the system isn't going to change any time soon, and I'm not going to go out of my way to be a dick and stick it to the man with a $0 tip because I'm smart enough to realize that the man doesn't give a fuck. I think a lot of people feel they are making some kind of statement by doing that, but it sucks for you because the company doesn't give a shit one way or the other whether I leave you a tip or not. The fact is that the employee that is working for peanuts shouldn't have to bust their ass for less than minimum wage, and so I try to do my part. I rarely leave a tip that isn't between 25%-50% of the bill. Doesn't mean I support the system or that I agree with the complaining that waiters/waitresses do about customers regarding tips (which can REALLY come off as having self-entitlement issues for those of us that do our jobs at a set salary that we agreed to from day 1), but I do support them in their efforts to live a decent life by working as opposed to being a bum on the side of the street asking for handouts, so it is a necessary evil.
Waiters/waitresses, stop bitching and whining about bad tips because of your misconceptions about the kindness of society as a whole. Businesses, start treating your employees like valuable assets by paying them what they deserve and maybe you won't have to waste all that money on retraining the newbies that come in when the old ones realize they were suckered into working for nothing.
In England it is very easy to get a delivery job , all you need is a driving license. You can goto many pizza/ Chinese / Indian places and ask for jobs. Then just hang around outside the shop in your car or wherever you happen to be and wait for orders to come in. You are not involved at all in the making of the food all you do is pick it up and drop it off. You get paid fuel money / more than minimum wage.
Heres something that may seem weird to you:
My pizza place does a great offer of £10.50 for 2 large pizzas. I order from there about 1-3 times a week and they remember who I am and my address straight away because I always ask for a "Veggie hot with no mushrooms".  Now not only have I never tipped my pizza guy but because of my repeat custom the price has been taken to £10.00 and I always get free garlic/mayo dip. 
You will not be seen as a douche for not tipping in England , it's repeat custom the companys want.
I think this just shows a misunderstanding of the restaurant business. You see, bad customers are one of the biggest problems in this business. They take up a lot of time, a lot of personele, and usually require you to give away free food, all just to hopefully keep them pacified. It's not even to make them happy, it's just so that they don't walk out upset and write a negative review on Yelp.
&gt;I'm sure the countless restaurants who go out of business everyday from not enough patronage will be happy to hear that
And being able to stream-line those customers to just the good customers (which is *most* people) would allow for a lower overhead and faster business.
&gt;Somewhat short sighted, yes if you only consider yourself, YOU might be better off without the bad tipper
No, myself, the busser, host, bartender, food runner/expeditor, all lost potential money on just a poor tip. You see, as a server, I still have to tip out a bare minimum to all these individuals for their assistance throughout the day. It usually averages about 5% of my total sales. More often than not (read: almost always), we will tip "heavy" and give them extra on top of the required minimum. We rarely have a problem with this, it gives them incentive to work harder for us, we get a higher turn-over rate, thus more customers, and more tips; they are rewarded for their effort. On a bad day, or after a particularly large stiff ($100+ bill is a lot of money to receive no tip on), it becomes very difficult to tip more than that 5% minimum. So they might not "lose" money like we do, but they do lose out on potential money.
&gt;but the business wont, and if the business goes under, you're out of a job.
No, because problem customers put a bigger dent in business than none at all. And *most* poor tippers tend to be very needy to begin with. The "nice" customer who just doesn't tip is so rare that you can't even count them in. So ignore the occasional "Mr. Pink".
Let's use an example that I went through last week. This might run a little long, so bare with me. 
I run a 6 table section. All day, everyone's happy, people are tipping well, the sun was out, things are rocking. I get one very needy table in the middle of the mid-afternoon rush. Every time I walk out of my section, another server is telling me that they wanted me at the table. They complained about the drink time when it was in no way an unreasonable wait. Quite literally, they were asking me where their drinks were in just the time it took me to input their drink order, much less the time it took for the bartender (who was already swamped with about 15 tables' drinks ahead of their order) to make the drinks. Completely unrealistic expectation.
Now, because I have to spend so much time constantly going back to this table, addressing every complaint (they complained something about every appetizer), I did not have enough time to take care of my other 5 tables. So it appeared that I was ignoring them, when every time I wanted to go check on my other tables, this one needy table would have to grab my attention.
At the end of that round, I barely received 15% from the other 5 tables, when all day it had been well over 20% tips from everyone. But it was understandable, I had not been able to cater to their needs. And this one needy table ended up stiffing me anyway on $300 because they thought my service was poor, when in reality they just had completely unrealistic expectations.
Management ended up comping all of their appetizers just to keep them pacified and not leave upset. That's food that we cooked for them, and did not receive any money for. 5 other tables were all inconvenienced and unhappy when without this table, they would have been completely satisfied with a great experience. Possible that they may not even want to come back after that. And on top of that, I got stiffed on what should have been about $60 in my pocket. I still have to tip out around $15 to my support staff, so that's money that I outright lost. I lost money taking care of them. And if they had tipped their $60 that it should have been, I would have easily tipped my support staff $20 instead of $15.
Now, you tell me that their business was worth it. 5 upset tables, lost money on comps for food, my time and money, my support staff's time and money, plus the frustration of food that was sent back to the kitchen, thus delaying all the other customers' meals that were on the line. Plus consider that they took up a table that would have been better suited for another good/nice customer.
**TL:DR** No, we genuinely are better off and make more money (both myself and the business) when bad customers don't come in at all. 
Although a great dream and your reasons for doing so are noble and proud, a comic shop is not a moneymaker.  Unless the shop is heavily into those cheesy weirdo-novelty pop culture bullshit toys, it will never support itself selling exclusively comic books and comic book related props.  And even then, it's a long shot as to whether you'll even break even.  There just isnt a huge comic book market out there to begin with, and the advent of e-readers and sellers online, the old-school comic book stores of yesteryear really have no place anymore, in Estonia or anywhere else for that matter.  Sadly, times change.  
**** Don't expect to get rich off a comic book store, and if you want to make any money from it at all you better have a great business plan.
Jesus Christmas, you don't have to go so far as to point out a flaw you noticed. Do that often enough and it'll get her guard up faster than saying you went to Hooters for some wings. What's wrong with mentioning something that actually shows you listened, like "right, Bethany, she's the one who works at Wachovia, right? Didn't you two get your nails done together last week?"

So what you're saying is, the NSFW subreddit should be SFW because all the good artists are wasting their time making things you don't approve of. (
Or, you know, maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about and am just jumping to conclusions. Eh.
Our group finished CotCT a few months back, so I'll share my thoughts:
The first three books are a very nice change of pace from the usual DnD adventure tropes.  They take place entirely in Korvosa and have a more intimate feel than most high fantasy hack-n-slash adventures.  It's a good mix of roleplaying and slaughter with ample opportunities for characterization.
Books 4 and 5 are definitely a departure--and one that our group had some difficulty with.  Almost out of nowhere the adventure path shifts to a traditional "let's go questing for the **Item** in dangerous locales!" kind of thing.  It's not bad for what it is... it's just such a departure and, in my opinion, a little hackneyed.  Unless your character A) likes the Shoanti barbarians or B) hates undead you might have trouble with it.
Book 6 does do a pretty good job of bringing it all together.  Oh, and the last fight is not... typical.  It was very fun in my opinion.
My advice to all the players would be to make sure your character has some strong motivation for wanting to help the city of Korvosa; be it patriotism, or family, or disliking Cheliax, or whatever.  That should help keep you interested as things progress.
 It was a good experience and I'd recommend it, but it did wear on our group in books 4-5.
Call me crazy but i look at the figures of how dangerous alcohol is (being in rehab i have known this for a long time, its one of the only things that have potentially fatal withdrawal symptoms.) i start to think about bartenders. We pay people to administer us this drug, is it insanely radical to think about the job opportunities involved in legalizing and regulating other drugs? Ugh, sometimes i don't know if American legislation regarding this subject will ever be logical. It's filled with so much misinformation fueled by fear based avoidance programs. The sad conclusion i have to come to is that its far more beneficial to keep this war on human rights going for the people that benefit from it. Right now the [prison construction industry]( is one of the most lucrative and crooked forms of business you can get into.  Not to mention all the legal fees you pay when going through the legal system, and who can overlook the figures of the overwhelming racial, and socioeconomic favor the prison system has? The fact is the drug war and prohibition is a war on human rights, minorities, the working class, and impoverished people of the world with its effects reaching countries all over. I'm rambling, just excited to see another advocate out there...
TL:DR- Word. 
This. One time I was driving and a van for Company X (can't remember the name) was riding my ass. I mean SERIOUSLY riding my ass. There were no cars to my right, so I got over and they did too. It was clear they weren't trying to get me to speed up, they were fucking with me. After five minutes they swerved around me, laughing and giving me the finger.
I called the company number. There was no "how's my driving?" extension, so I dialed to the vice president and left message like this: "hello, this message is in regards to your company van and its passengers. It is 7:30pm, Monday, on i70 east. The plate number is xxxxxxx. My reason for calling is as follows. . . The two men inside this van have been tailing me for 5 minutes. I have tried to get away from them by moving to another lane, but they followed behind me, laughing and giving me the middle finger. Not only am I calling out of concern for the safety of my passengers and myself, first and foremost, but I am also calling to let you know about the extremely unprofessional way these two men are representing your company. I imagine that you WILL address this issue appropriately. If you would like to discuss this incident further, please call me at **********.  Thank you."
do it. Don't be rude but don't be a pushover. and list your problem and your demands. Bring up image; image is everything most of the time. 
Hey, I work at a radio station full-time for the summer, and no, as a general rule they don't change the tempo. Only reason they sometimes do is if it's within a larger mix (our station plays mixes on Friday nights, for example), so for continuity they might speed up or slow down a song to match the previous or next song.
However, another possible explanation for the discrepancy (and MUCH more likely) is that there are two different versions of the song. For example, in the case of Katy Perry, there are two versions of "E.T.". The album version, and then a remix version with Kanye rapping, so it's entirely conceivable that they tweaked the tempo a little bit between the two versions.
Also, different "speeds" (tempo), is different from "pitching it up slightly"(pitch/key). So is it faster, or higher?
 No. And if they did, it not the radio station that changed the tempo, it's probably just a remix that changes it a little.
I am 23, but my partner and I have been together for 5 years -by some amazing providence, we've managed to grow up together well, and it just gets better.
However- It is not always good. Ready for an absolutely huge block of text?

Any relationships have hard times, and unfortunately we will create hard times. They will have to deal with stuff from us that another couple would never have to dream of. It is someone of a special breed who can live with us, and make it work. You will need to accept that he will always feel worried and frustrated for you in one sense, but there are definitely things you can do to help alleviate this and aid your communication.
*1. Have other outlets*
That is for both of you. 
You need other people, so that when he is overwhelmed he is not your only line of defence. He needs people to help with you. Even though he may bear the brunt of a lot of it- he is the person who has to see you everyday, who you will feel most open with- he can't be your everything because that is a hard thing for him. So you have your pdoc, but it is useful if you have other places to go and people to trust. I know this is hard. For me, it is my sister and one close friend. My parents are fantastic, but they live a fair way away. I do go up alone for a week every now and again- it is nice for me to have family time, but if we've had a hard time I know it is good to let him refresh. Recently I had not been doing so well, and he had planned a three week camping holiday with his 'boys.' He was feeling guilty and worried about going because I had a bad episode just before, but I was able to show him that there were others that could be there for me instead for that time, and that it is okay for him to prioritise himself when he needs to. 
Part two of that is, he needs other people to help him. Initially I didn't want anybody at all to know about my severe episodes of depression, later diagnosed as bipolar. But this was unfair. He needed someone to talk to, and while he could talk to my family or friends, he really needed someone for himself. So I let him tell one of his best mates- who I am good friends with too- and just having someone else he could tell when things weren't good, someone to lend a hand who understood exactly what he was helping with, was worth the world. As time goes on, it might not be a bad idea for him to speak to someone professional, but it is always important that you let him have an outlet, no matter how secret you want to keep it.
*2. Get your vocabulary down*
My partner has heard it all- good, bad, and the ugly. But if you keep hitting him every day with every terrible thought in your head can take a toll. Flipside is, there are often days when I really don't want to talk at all, and he would get really worried at what was going down in my head. 
This is why you have to come up with your own language. If you can talk him through everything early, then he will know what it means if -in my case- you say you are 'jittery' or 'bouncy' or 'restless.' For me, these are three examples which indicate that I am on a mild upswing, but to watch it depending on if it is (jittery) 'anxiety, racing thoughts, panics, need for reassurance, resistance to reassurance,', (bouncy) 'feeling really upbeat, creative, often a lot of fun, but with the potential for grand ideas, overspending if it gets too far' or (restless) 'dissatisfaction, prone to anger, quick flips in mood, probably he should stay out of the line of fire.' Because he knows me, these words, and now an amazing ability to read my physical cues, from this little information he understands my headspace, and has a way of asking how I am feeling without making me describe every symptom. One of the worst things we have, is when I tell him I feel 'really bad,' then it means I know I don't have to say that word 'suicidal.' And he knows this is when he needs to take control and stay vigilant. I have hundreds of these words- depression is often a lot more complicated to explain- but it is just so vital that you can let him in on how you are going without overwhelming him, and so he has a vocabulary framework in which to ask you how you are going.
*3. Keep in touch with how he is doing*
It can become habit just to talk about how you are going. It's not selfish, it is just that often how you are going will have the more immediate impact, and this is what he will want to talk about most. But it is important that you ask him, very often, how he is going. 
You will ask how he is going with friends/work/life, and obviously this kind of connection is important in any relationship. But, particularly after a bad episode, it is good to make sure you do a debrief. Talk to him about how he felt. It is a good outlet, but it often gives you an outside look into how you present. This can help you in the long run- he might notice a pattern in behaviour or corresponding actions which indicate something you hadn't thought of.  But it is good for you to understand more how he is feeling at specific times - helplessness is often a huge problem- then you can reassure him, and keep a dialogue open about what you need to be doing. Sometimes it is a tweak in the vocabulary above, and sometimes it is knowing that if you have had a few bad days, or weeks, or successive episodes, how this is impacting him specifically. Know when he needs a break, and when you can really help him out with this. It is really scary for him too, and often scarier because he is watching someone he loves fall to pieces, or fly too high, and doesn't know what to do. Telling him after what he did that was good and what could have helped is good. But I find, even after five years, sometimes it is just so necessary to tell him he has done everything he can. That he did everything right. That even if it went downhill, that you know and feel that he could not have done anymore to stop it. Make him know that his hard work is making a difference, even when it doesn't seem that way to him. 
*4. Give him an out*
This is the hardest thing you will do, but I honestly feel like if you love them enough, this is one of the most important things to do.
Let him know that if this gets too hard, it is okay. You can say you don't know what you would do without him- but it is important to tell him that you will do something. 
You do not want him staying because he feels obligated, or scared, or overwhelmed. You want him to stay because he loves you, and feels that there is a lot more good coming from the relationship than bad. That is not to say that he will not feel frustrated, angry, overwhelmed, unable to get away. But if this is a feeling he is having all the time- if this outweighs the pleasure in the relationship- you need him to know that you will let him go if he needs it, with no guilt. There can be a particular concern when it comes to someone breaking up with someone over an inability to cope with the complications of mental illness.Sometimes there is an unwillingness, a feeling of failure, or a feeling of self loathing which accompanies someone who wants to get out of a relationship with someone with mental health issues. That they are letting you down.
This is the fear you are talking about when you say you think he will decide you are too much work. And you might be for him. This does not reflect badly on either of you, even though it may hurt.
Unfortunately you will always be 'hard work' but everyone is in their own way. Everyone has flaws and problems that makes their relationship complicated. One person can be happy with someone, where another would self combust. For someone, you will not be too much, and I hope that it is this guy. I believe that I have my match, and that if there is anyone for me it is my partner. He not only makes me happy as a person, but the way in which he has been able to roll with the punches that bipolar throws is a constant amazement to me. He has kept making the choice to stick by me, but I always want him to know that I appreciate it is a choice.
Just like it would be okay for me to break up with him for any of a hundred reasons, you need to be sure that they know that bipolar is allowed to be a reason. This will benefit you in the long run too.

*4. Enjoy the good times*
Seems stupid, and I know you know this, but make sure you enjoy the good times. Be silly, do things you both love. If you have had a bad episode it is really nice to do something nice together- out or in- to boost both of your spirits. Unlike almost any others, we bipolars know what a gift it is to be able to control your own feelings, and to consciously choose to use them for good. This is a relationship after all- not a nursing home, even though it can feel like that. Take every chance you can to connect with each other. Keep the relationship first in your lives, everything else is details.
*I hope that made sense* and that some of it helped. 
There is a lot both of you can do to help each other mitigate the complications which will arise as a result of your bipolar. By being conscious of each others experiences, and respectful of their limits, you can definitely make it work if you both throw yourselves in.
"... and the final argument will begin." Sounds like you are looking for a fight. If you're going to go to battle do it through a lawyer. I can understand that you want your revenge but don't just rush into it. Get every single one of your ducks in a row first via your lawyer. IANAL (though you should be talking to one) but I think best case is your lawyer helps you get secure evidence and since it sounds like she has more assets than you do, you could end up getting half of your communal estate. Worst case is that you have your heated argument with her, she is somehow able to cover her tracks and deny the affair, and you are left being the asshole who left his wife. (again, IANAL)
Get a fucking lawyer.
This is extremely heartbreaking. All I can say is that you can never trust this person again. I am in a similar situation now and I think (I say think because I honestly still hurt) it will get easier....
Just about 2 months ago I asked my girlfriend of 5 years to marry me. We've been perfect for each other, and our lives were so much a part of each other it was the next step in our relationship.  She accepted, everything was going perfectly then almost randomly my life started to fall apart. 
A little backstory: I had been supporting her while she completed her degree and applied to medical school, I worked a 9-5 and payed our rent, bills, etc. and as such had put off school until (I thought) she was done with school.
so...
She had a long time friend who she hadn't seen in awhile come into town and they were going out for 'girls night'. I had no problem with this because having some alone time is healthy (or so I thought).
Well the time comes around that she might usually get home from the bars, and I've heard no word. Several hours go by of her not answering phone calls or replying to texts, then at 5:30 AM she strolls in, drunk, defensive, and asking why I would be mad. Of course we get into an argument about where she was, she lies and tells me she fell asleep at a friends.
A few days later I find out from one of her friends that she had left the bars with several guys she met, and drove for over an hour to go skinny dipping with them in some hot springs and had since still been talking to one of the guys every day via text / phone calls.
Needless to say our relationship fell apart and everything is in shambles. This is a week before I was to quit my job and were moving over 400 miles away for medical school, after several years of me supporting her, and putting my desires and dreams on hold to better hers. 
This was about a month ago now that this happened, and it hurts every single day, but each day it hurts a little less....
**** It gets easier man... it just takes time. 
KEEP YOURSELF BUSY, it will help the pain.

To be fair, a wife (or any significant other) doing "couple-ish" things with another person isn't *always* an indicator of inappropriate behavior. Lest any redditors see -jay's- comment and start to worry:
I'm a straight, married female who does that kind of stuff with a straight, single male friend, "B". My husband, "N", who's working overseas, always knows precisely when, where, and what I'm doing with this guy. I make *damn* sure to answer the phone if N calls while I'm with B, and B's authorized to answer the phone if I'm somehow indisposed so N knows his calls aren't being ignored. Because, see, N is my #1 priority and his peace of mind comes first. The end result is that N and B are on extremely good terms despite having only met a couple of times, and B kind of acts like a bodyguard for our marriage. 
Jesus, man. I can't even *imagine* having any kind of an affair with B after working so hard to gain and maintain N's trust. I'd never be able to live with myself if I betrayed someone who has that kind of faith in me.
**** I'm a married woman who does "couple-ish" things with a male friend. It's utterly non-nefarious, I work hard to ensure the husband's peace of mind, and it all works pretty well. Gotta take these things on a case-by-case basis.
OP, I'm truly sorry for you, man. I say go ahead and get whatever closure you need, but give yourself a little distance first so you can gain some perspective. That way you can be even more scathing and incisive in any eventual confrontations, and the bitch deserves all the scathing and incisive you can throw at her.
Maybe. Most expensive/smart lawyers have prospective clients sign a waiver to future conflicts. A lot of top lawyers will not listen to your facts without such a disclosure. Simply because it is not in a lawyer's best interest to get conflicted out of any possible case, and they realize people think like this.
They will not be able to disclose any of your information to the adverse party if they represent it, and in no way can they use the information to your disadvantage, but once again when doing a consultation any smart lawyer will only learn the necessary facts to realize if there is a case and if he is willing to take it. So this sounds great in theory, but doesn't usually work in practice.
tl,dr; If your lawyer does not make you sign a future conflict waiver before consultation then he probably isn't very savvy to begin with.
Edit: if you want to check the sources ABA Model Rules of Behavior 1.6: Confidentiality, 1.7: Conflict of Interest Current Client, and 1.18: Duties to Prospective Clients.
Sincere question here --- **why** is everyone recommending lawyers?
Of the divorcees I know, it seems the happiest ones are the ones who talked it out amongst themselves; got a lawyer together in the end for the final paperwork.
Or is the goal of all these reddit-advice-givers to burn away all of both of their assets in an expensive legal battle where the lawyers get everything.
My (apparently minority opinion) advice - talk (not fight) to her about how it upset you - perhaps sleep with her friends - perhaps get a divorce if you two want, or relationship counselling if you two want.
Any of those give a chance of one or both of you being happy.
**TL/DR:** But if you lawyer-up, she'll be forced to lawyer up; and all discussion will be driven by the lawyers leading to a situation where only the lawyers will win and you'll both end up mad and broke.
I guess you have to go continue what you were doing: fighting zombies in Atlanta.
But seriously, coming from a "I've been through this" perspective: my girlfriend of 5 years and I had been through one year of high school, all of college together, were living together, I was going to buy the ring and get married after graduation (I had an extra year of undergrad), plop down in our hometown and start a family, and a few months before I was going to propose, she dumps me. Turns out she had fucked one of our old friends from high school (he was also with someone else at the time, another good friend I had grown up with). Shit got messy. Both couples broke up. Everybody's angry at everybody else. My fault for pushing her away, her fault for fucking another guy, my fault for being a prick all the time, her fault for not communicating anything she was feeling to me, yelling, crying, begging to come back, friends "accidentally" calling both of us to meet up for coffee at the same time at the same place and trying to get us to work out our differences. It sucked, OP. It sucked hard. 
But then the world kept spinning. I decided not to prolong the pain by dwelling on it, and fighting her for every last bit of truth I could find that could make her in the wrong. I finished school. Found someone new. That "old friend from high school" and I occasionally still hang out and things aren't that weird, because we had our words and both came to the conclusion that she was insane. Lots of "sorry brah"s. Her? She got married 6 months (to the day) after our breakup. They seem happy. I want to call him and see if he knows what she did (he was a marine, deployed when all of this happened). But it's better to let that sleeping dog lie. And lie I'm sure she will.
Point of all this? Don't carry malice. Treat her as you would anyone else, even if she is a cheating, lying, bitch of a whorebag. Get your shit straightened out with her in whatever lawyer-y way that reddit suggests (i'm no expert on that), then walk away. Preferably along the beach, into the sunset. It's better for your mental health that way. Sure, your life contains everything that reminds you of her. People are like Play-Doh--you can't mix them together over time and expect that when you're done, you can just pull the colors back apart cleanly. Bits of the orange always end up in parts of the green, and you'll find them for years to come. But the longer you dwell on it, you're self-inflicting the pain upon yourself.  I went and found all of the things that were hers, either that she had given to me, or little pictures, trinkets, things I didn't need around me, and I had a bonfire. Not in a mean way, but it felt like more of a cleansing than anything else. This 5.9736×10^24 kg of rock will continue to spin, and it's easier to be on it if nothing extra is weighing you down. 
*** Get shit together, walk away with no ill feelings, life moves on, gets better. Takes time, but reddit will never leave you. Also, go have a good fap. It really does help.
This hits close to home, as my stepbrother is experiencing something similar.  I'll share this story and hopefully it'll help you see right and wrong decisions.
My brother has been married to his wife for a couple years.  He was deployed to Afghanistan for the last year and didn't see his wife much.  While he's waiting at the airport to finally fly back home, his wife tells him that she cheated on him for the past few weeks.
Obviously, he's devastated.  He's been gone from the country for a year, and has been looking forward to coming back to a life of normalcy.  Then everything crashes down on him.
She tries to make it sound like it's his fault.  She says that he can be an asshole, and that he shouldn't have been away.  She has two kids, one of which is his.  She says that the other kid always hated him, and she keeps playing these mind games with him.
He, on the other hand, keeps coming home with flowers and chocolates and keeps trying to kiss up to her so she'll want to be with him again.  He's taking it really hard on himself and thinks that it's his fault, all while she continues to travel with the kids and screw this other guy.
It wasn't until he removed all the money from their bank accounts that she started to try and kiss up to him.  As soon as the money was back, she went back to the other dude.  He STILL wants to work it out with her.  It wasn't until recently (this is an ongoing thing still) that our family was able to convince him to go to an attorney and start filing divorce papers and fight for custody of his kid.
This may not apply to you, as you seem to have your head on pretty straight.  Just make sure you never blame yourself, and don't lose your self confidence.  Take whatever time you need to heal, but realize when it's time to put your gears in motion and take control back of your life.
*** My stepbrother comes back from Afghanistan for a year to find his wife cheating on him.  She mindfucks him and he kisses her ass until he finally starts snapping into place
Wow, man. This sounds exactly like how I figured out my girlfriend of 3 years at the time was cheating on me. Got the same weird sensation to check her phone (not normal) to find BJ texts and all kinds of shit. It broke me. But I was stupid and after a month of being away from her I had to call her to settle the car insurance refund and ended up setting up a date. Fast forward 3 months, and I find out shes pregnant. We try to be together again. Then fast forward to when my daughter (who is now 2 almost 3 and is my whole world) is 9 months old and I find out she's cheating again. Now I am a 22 year old with a huge pile of debt, in between jobs but still giving every cent I get to my daughter. It is incredibly hard what you're going through (I know from experience) but my best advice to you is to break it off and **DON'T** go back. It may be the hardest thing you have to do in your life, but trust me, in the long run, you will not regret it.
*** I was in an extremely similar situation, but I took the cheating whore back and 3 months later got her pregnant (not planned) and now I am a 22 yr old with a 2 yr old daughter and a pile of debt. BREAK IT OFF AND NEVER LOOK BACK.
Hey, treeslashtrees. This is going to sound mean, but it is in your best interest to get your shit together. You obviously need to dump the whore and maybe introduce your friend to a baseball bat, but altough a better woman would have tried to figure it out together with you and a better man would have come to you or just rejected your wife altogether (altough it is really hard to refrain yourself as a man, biology beats society most of the time). It really sounds like you don´t have much going on for yourself. I understand it is not easy to make it but you better use this chance to take a good look at your life so that you can keep your next woman if you so desire. it probably is also your fault.
Sorry if this is repeated info. Here's the bad news:
In most states, cheating, whether it can be proven or not, has no bearing on divorce. Here in MI, we're a no-fault state in cases like this, which means they don't give a shit about what happened, they only care about who gets what.
My boss' wife cheated on him. He got a good lawyer. in the end he wrote the bitch a check for 80 grand. He had her ON VIDEO fucking his friend, caught n a hidden camera.
My brother's wife cheated on him, he had text evidence and credit card bills that showed her hot-tubbing while the kids were at grandma's. She got the kids and the house.
We forward-thinking men refer to these as "The price of freedom". Your life will be better without her. You will have more money and more time and energy for the things you love, you'll reconnect with old friends and family. Just turn your back on the whole situation and move on. don't take her calls, and same for your "friend".
there is no justice in divorce.
Stay strong brother.
Something VERY similar happened to me about a month ago. I admit that I am merely a young adult (19) and my relationship with this girl was short, only four months. She was, however. my "first" and about a month prior to her leaving me she had been cheating on me with a long time friend whom I had know for YEARS. Same thing as you, she would frequently meet with him when I wasn't available, and on occasion ditch me to hang out with him. She called my jealousy unreasonable and my suspicion stupid. I told myself I was being unfair, but when I found that out I was more than a little bit angry, needless to say.
 Same shit, different pile.
My advice to you is to do exactly what you say you're going to. Go live life solo for a while, you can learn a lot about yourself that you didn't already. You're the only person that can't betray you, in my opinion.
This will be long, and I don't know what value it has but, I cried thinking about your situation and I just wanted to type something out.
I'm sitting at home when I should be at work, but nothing will be different wherever I am so, I'm typing.  The movie Too Many Husbands is playing in the background now and I've smoked about a half pack of cigarettes since getting up at 8.  
My first girlfriend cheated. Best friend, New Years, with me passed out next to them. Separately, they both told me the next day.  
I've never had a better situation than that. 
Second major girlfriend. Cheated with best friend. Then, we got back together, and what? oh yeah, I later found out she cheated with at least two other 'friends'. Then, one day, while living with me, simply left. No note, no call, didn't hear a thing for a year, then when I saw her, she said nothing. I still wonder what the hell happened. 
I met my future ex wife.  I kept an eye on her for five years, then married when I felt she was safe. One day, years into marriage, things felt 'off', and I asked her what was going on.  She said "nothing", and then I installed a hidden caller ID unit, as well as one she knew about. (Back in the day, when it was a new thing.)  I discovered that she was cheating with an employee/friend of mine. 
Once I discovered that she was deleting phone calls, I hooked up a recorder.  One day I came home while she was working (Home business) and grabbed the recorder and listened.  "Don't act like you like me when we go out tonight." among other things.   Barf.  The worst was hearing her tone of voice. I realized I hadn't heard that happy tone in a long time. 
A thirty year old man ran around the neighborhood like his hair was on fire. He ran so hard, so fast, and if anyone saw him they probably thought he was insane.  I'm quite sure he was, I just needed to do something other than break things.  
I didn't know what was going on for sure so, I hired someone to follow her (Yep,  stalker move.) and told her that I had a meeting and wouldn't be home until late.   When the PI called, he told me the hotel they went to, and that there were 'rhythmic motions' coming from the car prior to entering the hotel. (The tracking device the PI had me install had a sensor for that too.)  Lovely.
I was livid. I confronted her.  (He was on the way to our home to go out with us, and I had 'seen' myself letting him in the door, then hitting him with a baseball bat.  I didn't, or I probably wouldn't be here now.)  
We talked and she said she was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.  Instead of her quitting, she started seeing him whenever she wanted.  It was terrible.  I didn't want a divorce, I wanted to have my life back. I was not prepared for this. I flat freaked the fuck out.  Day by day, I just kept trying/hoping it would work out.
This went on for almost three years.  It was hell. I couldn't (wouldn't, whatever.) let go.   I became a super stalker, and after a year, I started cheating too.  There probably isn't a trick that I didn't use to find out what she was doing.   It was like, if I didn't have proof, she would say that she wasn't doing anything.  It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous. I still am.  The sweet girl I was 'dating' didn't even hear me when I explained that I still wanted my marriage to work out.  
I couldn't tell you the number of times that I'd say something like "Where were you?" and she'd lie, and I'd say "No, you were 'here', and you parked 'here' and 'did this'.  Fools, both of us. What was the point? I even used my 'girlfriend' to spy on her.  Barf. What a fucking jerk.
My dad had gone through a lot of problems with his business, and long story short, he had placed everything he owned in my name.  His business, his properties and even his home.  Fearing the divorce would cost him half of his assets, I transferred everything back into his name, and started another business.  Meaning to become a less desirable target. 
I'm still a less desirable target, ten years later.  Without me, dad made a few bad decisions and had some serious bad luck, and he's currently in debt so bad that there's no way it will ever get better.  Me too.
Next girlfriend, cheated with a close friend, whom I had just spent about a week with while helping him with the loss of his father.  I used to run into them at our old favorite bar, where he would drunkenly apologize to me.  She never did. They're married with kids now.
Next girlfriend, cheated with a coworker of hers.  
Currently, I'm dating someone who was dating someone else when I met her.  I'd been single for five years and when she contacted me through an old aol profile, I thought, what the hell, I guess I'll be the other guy for a change.  
I didn't expect I'd be dating her five years later.  I also didn't expect to almost lose my home or that I'd have to use her in order to save it.  Now, she owns my home.  A while back I caught her webcamming with an old fuck buddy.  Then, a few weeks ago we had lunch, and then she said she was going to go to the mall.  She didn't.
As I was heading back to work, I saw her drive past the mall exit.  I didn't say anything, she could have been going to a preferred gas station, or whatever.  Days later, we ended up in an argument about something stupid, and for whatever reason, she said "You don't trust me."   
That's when I lost it.  I said "You're probably right, you know why? Here's an example of why I might not:  Remember last week when we had lunch, and you said you were going to the mall?  Well, you missed your exit.  Where did you go?"
She tried to lie, and kept trying to lie, then finally told me it was someone she used to see when she was dating someone else (A fuckbuddy) but that there was nothing going on.  Pretty much the same story as the webcam guy.  ("I just thought it would be hot."))
So, I'll be 45 in about a day, "my" home is in my girlfriends name, and I'm dealing with a level ten cheater who might even be sneakier at evading detection than I am at detecting.  Especially considering that over the course of five years, she's heard most of my stories about such matters.  
(example of her sneakiness: Her boyfriend thought she was cheating, so one day when she said she was going to a movie in order to see me, she had me drive to a theater and bought a ticket, for proof. A new trick, to me.)
She says she loves me, and desperately wants to get married.  She's actually tried to ask me.  
What am I going to do?  Fuck if I know.  I'm hoping for a lottery win.  (I never have spare cash to buy tickets.)  Frankly, there's been a couple days I just thought I'd take my fastest vehicle and run it into a wall, but I'd never do that to my parents.  
I'm so sorry for your situation.  I wish I could do something more than commiserate, or share stories.  I guess, if nothing else, you can see what kind of results you get from actions like mine.    
 A)  I'm a maladaptive, broke, jaded, cheater magnet with stalker tendencies. 
B) Don't let this happen to you.
C) FML
Oh, and if you're on the west coast, I can probably help you find a cheap car or keep whatever you find running.  
I'll tell you the same thing my dad told me one day:  Son, I'm broke too, but I'm broke on a whole different level than you, I'm helping *you* because I can't help *myself*. 
I have to say... as a woman who has hurt someone (I've never cheated by any means, but was definitely in a bad place in my relationship).... Don't give her the time of day to talk about it, she doesn't have the compassion to break up with you or be honest with you, she feels like she has all the power at this point. 
Trying to talk to her will give her the opportunity to talk you out of leaving (financial reasons, guilt, it was you that made me do this, etc)... TAKE THE POWER BACK AND GET THAT SKANK OUT OF YOUR LIFE. Don't give her any options, the fact that you want to talk about it just shows her you still love her and there is a shot to make it work. 
Just leave, don't give her a chance, that will hurt her more than anything else. She deserves to be abandoned, she abandoned you... rather heartlessly I might add. And anybody in your life that knows the situation will most certainly be supportive of you, and not a cheater and you're ex best friend. It seems that if they are so involved with each other, you can leave them the freedom to 'be together', and i would bet all my chips that he would leave her too, because he obviously doesn't respect her or you--- it doesn't seem like he wants to marry her or get her to leave you, I doubt he would stick with her....
*** - leave her without a husband, and without any control or power over the situation. Karma is a bitch and you will be happier without her taking advantage of you... and she's going to get dumped twice anyway. 
Wow.
This could have been me, if she hadn't started before I could propose.
Get the hell out, man. Never look back. Ever. Neither of them is worth it.
Don't kill yourself. I promise you that there are people to whom you matter, even if this whore isn't one of them. Stay alive. If not for yourself (at least for now), then for them.
 Get out. Stay out. Stay alive.
Your story made me cry.  This happened (sans best friend, but with plenty of guys to make up for THAT lack of betrayal) to me.  I moved out while she was at work.  We were together for 12 years.  Knew each other since we were 15... Not A Day Passes I Don't Think About Her.  I left Houston and moved to Denver.  Left everything I owned in storage in Houston. Maybe a relocation away from what you knew together, people you knew together restaurants you ate at together.... would be in your best interest.
Move away from not only her.  But the memories.  Perhaps you're stronger than I.  It is not/ wasn't her that I missed.  It was what we used to be. 
You're plight is honorable and you are in my heart.  &lt;3
-Michael Ian 
What is that phrase.. Oh yes.
Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.
I suggest that you do not forgive her.. I had a similar situation (not marriage, but cheating on me) He cheated on me once with a girl my age.  I forgave him.  He cheated on me AGAIN with the SAME GIRL. I found out that the second time he cheated, he started A WEEK after I forgave him the first time.  There was about a two month interval between the cheating.
Being a dumb ass at the time, I forgave him again.  He almost ruined my life.  I dumped him months after the cheatings for other reasons.
do not be a dumb ass like I was, forgiving cheating twice
The Kings have just GOT to be the start, middle, and end of this.  I feel like they need to come in and just beat everybody.  Make the point that *as a tag team*, they are pretty much unstoppable.  This should culminate in a couple of months with a 4-way elimination match between the Kings, Santino and Koslov, the Nexus, and the Usos, during which all three of the other teams are focused on getting the belts of the Kings, but are unsuccessful.
After a couple months of dominating (but not burying) the current tag scene, singles stars start to team up thinking it's easy pickins, and find out otherwise.  At first it'll be high-level, second tier talent like Ziggler, Bryan, Barrett, etc.  Not necessarily these people, but this rung of the ladder.  Around this time, they should start wrestling occasional singles matches, but not having the same level of success.  Good matches against solid talent, but never any title wins.
Eventually, way down the road, they would maybe get cocky, and have to lose the titles to an impossibly huge pairing, like Cena and Orton or something.  Devote a whole month's build to the rematch, showing Cena and Orton beating them in singles matches, making people wonder if the Kings still have it.  But then at the next PPV, you give the rematch 20 minutes at minimum, and have the Kings pull off a hard-fought victory, solidifying the difference between singles and tag-team wrestling.
This would have to be closely followed by a wave of new signings of real teams that could legitimately challenge the Kings.  "You've beaten everyone here, so we found some new people."  And then things write themselves.
**- Differentiate singles and tag wrestling, Keep the titles on one great team for a long time, sign real teams after the belts mean something again.**

Au contraire.  BJs *can* spread cancer.
[Here is one such study]( and a [summary of the study by NPR](

 Oral sex is the leading cause of increasing US cancer rates.
I was largely overweight from the ages of 7-13. I am also 5'10" and a girl. During late elementary school and middle school, I was either friendless or hung out with the other outcast kids around me. My parents constantly belittled me for being overweight, telling me to eat less at meal times and blaming my lack of athletic skill on my "largeness".
Around the age of 13-14, I grew from my former 5'5" to 5'10", and with this growth, I lost around 40 pounds (going from 180 at five five to 140 at five ten). Needless to say, I did not look like the same person. People gave me compliments as well as sharing with me their utter shock at my complete and total transformation. 
I do not miss being fat whatsoever- in fact, I hate it the idea of it more than most things. I believe the constant taunting and degradation I dealt with during my teenage years eroded my self-worth and led me to have what is my 6th anniversary with anorexia nervosa. And yet, I think the whole ordeal just really showed me how petty and shallow most people are. It's really an experience in life to grow up shunned by your peers and teachers, fat is simply scary to a lot of people. 
I don't know how to feel about other people with their negative opinions of those who are overweight. On one hand, I understand what a bitch dieting and exercising is, but on the other hand, I see people and wince at the state of their physique. It just looks so unnatural to be so fat you can't walk properly nor function in society.
I honestly think in the long run, it is how you view yourself that is the most important. People are attracted to warmth, happiness, success and health. If you happen to put off any of those factors in above the average amounts, I'd expect you'd get decent returns.
I was a fat kid and yes, surprise, people do treat you differently.
There are essentially two major types of Zerg playstyles: aggressive and defensive.  When you play against aggressive Zergs you want to turtle up and pour all of your resources into defending and securing a third base.  When you play against defensive Zergs you want to be moving around the map with your army as much as possible in order to force units instead of drones.
Here are a few rules you can follow in PvZ that will help you find the answer to this question.
1. Get hallucinate reasonably fast.  You need a reliable way to constantly scout.
2. Scout his standing army.
3. If your army can take on his army fairly well then move out onto the map and make sure he sees your army.  This forces him to make units instead of drones.  Continuously scout, and if he doesn't respond with units then you need to move in and punish.
4. If your army cannot take on his army then just sit there.  He has already committed to producing units instead of drones so you do not need to put yourself at risk by moving out.  Aggressive Zergs actually want you to leave your base, so only move out when you have a strong timing.
Repeat this scouting process for the duration of the game, and keep in mind Zerg players can switch between these two styles in the middle of a game, so continuous scouting is required (hence the hallucination).  You need to force the defensive Zerg player to be able to take on your army at all times, which will force him to be honest when it comes to droning.  At the same time, moving out against an aggressive Zerg can be a potentially fatal move.
The most important thing to remember is that Zerg must sacrifice economy for any units that are produced.  If a Zerg has more army and more economy than you, then you either need to scout better and punish him earlier or you need to just macro better.
 Scout.  If you can kill his army, move out.  If not, sit there until you can.
Yes actually.  We call it frolf.  It's not actually frolf but there's an even longer story why we named it that.  
Essentially we have a giant Frisbee and throw it in the outfield where the two teams are.  
The person who throws the ball (lets say he's on team A), has to throw it to a teammate in the outfield.  There's also team B in the outfield to try to block a catch.  If team A (the thrower's team) catches the ball, they have to run around a baseball diamond to second base, all while the person who caught the ball has to run without being tackled.  If the person makes it to second base before his teammate gets tackled, one point.  Scoring is just like baseball.

Really if you think about it an Aircraft Carrier is like a city that floats;you got a tiny economy in there with mess halls and bunks and showers, places to read (navy special names for libraries?) and work out in the gyms and offices and.... well, if you think that the top of an aircraft carrier is like a roof for that entire city then you WERE playing airplane on the roof pretty well, considering if you jumped off it was like launching a plane off that small floating city (save for the plane).
**The roof, the roof is on fire, we don't need no water let the mother fucker burn, [burn mother fucker burn](
Either you are terrible at communicating your thoughts/feelings into a reddit post, or you're kind of immature.  Sorry.
Take a step back and realize you aren't running for president, so you don't have to talk politics.  Also, I've met these old fashioned dads, and they usually are doing their best, the way they know how.  You don't have to agree with their methods.  Relax, find comfort when you find common ground, instead of anxiety where you obsess over your differences.  If that means you have to find common ground first, then do it.  If the conversation turns toward something that makes you anxious, find a subtle way to change/back out from the subject.  Its not hard, unless they make it, which is where a good sense of humor will almost always save you.
P.S. I know a dumb, pretty, self-absorbed, ignorant bimbo too.  She's my sister.  If you learn to be easy-going, then you can put the silly things that once bothered you into perspective, and realize it doesn't affect your ability to have an enjoyable, meaningful time.

MvC3 has a feature that allows you to cancel your on-screen character's super with another person's offscreen. In this case, Weskers super was activated, and then cancelled into Deadpool's Level 3 Super.
The player activated Deadpool's Level 3 super instead of a normal super, because there is a glitch in MvC that allows certain characters Level 3's, like Akuma's raging demon, to become invincible to continuous stream projectiles (like Ryu's Super Hadoken) ~~when it is cancelled into~~ (doesn't have to be cancelled into, but should be cancelled out of by DHC or Xfactor).
The cancelling process is known as Delayed Hyper Combo (DHC) and is not a glitch - this is an active feature of the game that allows you to combo supers within supers, or safely switch characters while dealing damage.
**Swapping out Wesker for Deadpool during super is not a glitch. Deadpool walking through Iron Man's super is a glitch**

If I lived in the States, I would die of a heart attack in less than a month.
I wouldn't say anything yet. This might be the one thing she really wanted for a long time. Buying a car, a new car especially, is a big step for her. Right now, in her head, you're just her boyfriend. She shouldn't have to talk to you about big purchases she is making with her money. If you were already engaged then it is important to discuss these things with you, because in the end your debt is her debt and vice versa. If you both are living together I hope her car payment isn't going to lower the income she would use for the household. That is another conversation on its own though. Right now, just tell her you're happy for her. She's probably in her early to mid twenties, having your own place, new car, its exciting. Don't take that away from her. Maybe once you and her start talking about your future together and wanting to have more disposable income she might sell the new car and keep your car. This is all in the future though. You can't make all of her decisions for her, let her make her own as well. Also, you're still growing up, its ok to make mistakes. 
 Enjoy the car, talk about the future after you propose, buying a new car isn't the end of the world, she can always sell it in a year and use your car, but let it be her decision. 
That is absolutely correct. You have an outstanding grasp of foreign affairs (of the heart) which I think is because you are so sincere. As many have said she is a girlfriend all the op should do is shut up for now and when she asks for help with the payment or always complains that she has no money he should run for the hills. 
 Listen to the president. 
The used car market is in a bubble right now, esp for economy cars, where cars several years old with 30k miles only cost a couple of thousand less than new. It's perfectly reasonable to buy an efficient, reliable car like a Yaris new right now. Just because it's a 6 year loan doesn't mean she has to take that long to pay it off. She doesn't have much cash flow right now, but 3 years from now and a couple of raises later paying off the remaining $8k isn't going to be a big deal at all.
TL,DR; She'd rather have a good car than beer and dinner at the Olive Garden 
Karma is fun and very effective, no matter what some people say. You have to be very good with her and good at last-hitting in general. If you can do that, she's insane and pumps out a lot of AOE damage as well as being fairly supporty. Just don't play her as a full-on support; her heal is pretty crappy on everyone except tanks so you should build more like a tanky AP carry.
I max the shield first. It makes it impossible for the opponents to do any damage at all if you use it right and it hurts pretty bad at the same time when mantra'd. I max the Q second and take one rank in bond at level four for those pinch slowdown opportunities and also for farming (it does a surprising amount of damage when you drag it through minions).
As far as items go, Rod of Ages is probably the best to rush and the best item overall for Karma. Otherwise, Kage's Lucky Pick or a Philo Stone are good to grab quick. Your main source of income is farming/assisting so the extra gold can help a lot. Depending on the situation, I either go Ionian Boots or Sorceror's Shoes. If I don't get Ionian Boots, I try to grab a Fiendish Codex later and build it into Deathfire Grasp. It's a fun late-game item for Karma as well. And of course, Rabadabadabadabadabadon's. Things like Frozen Heart or Aegis are fantastic after you've got decent AP. It makes you even harder to kill than you already are.
Runes: magic pen. marks, mana regen per level seals, AP/level glyphs, and flat AP quints.
 Bursty AP. Almost never mantra the Q. Skill order: E &gt; Q &gt; W.
I don't like to build AP on Karma. I start with a double faerie charm + pots build or one faerie charm with an enemt jungle, and rush Philo. The reason is, I don't like to take farm from my lane partner, and a philo, occasional creep, and assist gold is plenty for me. Afterwards, I gauge how well we're doing. If my lane has scored a few early kills, I'll pick up my ionian boots of lucidity. If it's passive or we're losing, I get a HoG and tier 1 boots. Again, evaluate the gameplay as you b to buy items. Fed AD carries destroying you? Rush Thornmail or Frozen Heart. And FoN or BV for AP. I love tanky Karma because my shields are plenty strong without AP, and it allows for me to easily heal and disrupt fights by standing in the center. I also can meatshield much much better and let my dps run away if need be. By being in the center, I can help dps with my Q if we're winning, W an escaping enemy or a chasing teammate, etc. Late game, I like to upgrade my philo to either a eleisa's miracle if they're cc heavy or a shurelya's if not. Another item I love is QSS, as Karma has difficulties escaping with CC on her. Don't forget wards are your friends!
 buy wards. I like tanky karma. 
I sell Tempur-Pedic mattresses at my job, so I"ll see if I can make a few suggestions.
In terms of the mattress overlays, I hardly ever see customers buy it, because it just isn't a really economical solution. Comfort aside, it's adding three inches of thickness to an already bulky mattress, meaning fitted sheets won't work. it's also way overpriced for what you get. A twin TP overlay is $532 for 3" of foam. A twin OriginalBed is $699 for 8" of the same foam. Not exactly a spectacular deal.
The mattresses are expensive, but most of my customers have been very happy, particularly if they have back problems. Most companies offer a variety of financing options, if you care to do that.
Earlier model mattresses are more likely to be warm. Modern Tempur-Pedics have cooling layers designed to circulate air, although I can't speak for their efficacy from personal experience. Don't put a waterproof cover on it, as it will trap air and heat up very quickly.
You won't find a real Tempur-Pedic mattress for any less than the listed price. Tempur-Pedic controls the pricing, so the only difference you'll find is in the other perks offered. For instance Brookstone (my employer) offers a 90 night trial, free shipping and a $200 gift card to the store. Other shops throw in free pillows or  superior financing plans.
Part of our training teaches us that there's a 'learning curve' to memory foam mattresses. It can take some people a few weeks to be able to sleep normally as their body adjusts, others never get used to it. Try to find a retailer with a trial period, as an example, brookstone offers 90-nights in-home with no restocking fee (be forewarned, restocking fees can bite you in the ass, so ask up front). 
Memory foam mattresses in general have a very distinctive odor. It should dissipate within a week or so as it outgasses (harmless), but if you find it distracting, put a few drier sheets betweent he mattress and the covers, or Febreze it to hell and back.
Make sure you know where the retailer is getting their stock. The Tempur-Pedic warranty starts from the manufacture date, and improperly stored mattresses are at risk for having that warranty invalidated, or reduced in time. Larger clearinghouses order in bulk and ship from their warehouse, so if you want to make sure the mattress is in the best shape possible, try to find a retailer that orders from the factory to your house.
Pretty much any memory foam mattress you buy needs to be used with a solid boxspring. Using slatted boxsprings will cause the foam to sink and void your warranty, using coiled springs will tear it up. Tempur Pedic includes the price of a boxspring in the cost of a mattress. getting a generic one will probably require you to find your own.
If you aren't sure, and don't want to drop a few thousand dollars to try a mattress, get a Tempur-Pedic pillow first. They start at about $99, and are a good indicator when it comes to personal preference. Even better is trying out a mattress in-store, but give yourself enough time to put towards it. The foam softens with body heat, and it can take up to half an hour to conform completely.
If you're looking for my personal opinion, I'd spend the extra money for a Tempur mattress, if only for the warranty. 20 years is one of the best in the business, and I've heard it quoted that a measurable 1/4" dip in any one place is considered actionable (although again, I cannot speak for this from personal experience, and do not work with warranty claims). You can get a less expensive option, but you run the risk of having it break down after a few years, and needing to drop another few hundred dollars on it, meaning you might wind up spending more in the long-run. I tell everybody to do their math, and try before you buy, but it especially applies to something you'll be on for a potential 8-hours a night.
Good luck, feel free to PM if you have specific questions about a given mattress, I'm pretty well versed in the entire line.
Find someplace you can try one out for yourself.
Tu quoque: a logical fallacy where one ignores a position because the person who holds the position does not practice what they preach. Simply put, it is a logical fallacy to ignore what someone is saying just because they are a hypocrite.
 You should still stop smoking no matter how fat that asshole was.
Rather than criticizing you for not understanding, let me try to explain. I'm not British, so I might be a bit off, but here's my basic understanding of it:
There is this British comedy series called the "IT Crowd" (hilarious show, by the way) that this comic is referencing. The show primarily follows two IT geeks, Moss and Roy, neither of which know much about sports. 
In one episode (S03E02 "Are We Not Men"), they try to socialize with others by repeating generic sports phrases that would work in many scenarios. One of the phrases, as seen in the comic, was:
&gt;The thing about Arsenal is, they always try to walk it in.
 The OP, who likely doesn't know much about football, just used a generic sports phrase in order to make him self seem smart, and it worked.
anyone else find this whole thread laughable, being that its on an internet webpage in the first pace.
In my honest opinion, being an Anarchist has nothing to do with what you simply consume. Its the actions you take to promote and foster a more peaceful, anti-authoritarian, view. Self reliance is important for those who see the world as rigid and stratified, in the sense they cannot accept the continuum of class structures and resort to there own means of consolidation on so called "local" levels.
I for one smoke, own a computer, cell phone and stereo system.....ohh shit a tv too, AND ENJOY OWNING SUCH COMMODITIES.
How's about this one. instead of telling people what they should or shouldnt buy, live for yourself, do the things that make you happy and survive.  
I hate being told what to do just as much as I hate morons who dont know how to act.  "but who decides what the "right" way to act is," you may ask.  My best guess are those people involved in whatever situation in which action is required.  "Moral relativism?" maybe it is.  However, I have always found that term to be a blanket statement used by left-leaning thinkers (Dawkins for one) to mean no moral code whatsoever.
i could go on
TLDR. I smoke and i think its funny that vegans dont eat honey......anyone with me?

Here's the problem:
"if the OPs were not ignoring very good and thorough answers simply because they are too long..."
See, OP's are the ones asking the questions. They are the target audience. They are the ones that get to decide whether the answer meets their needs.
In another post, you note our culture's disturbing aversion to reading. We have a bigger problem than simple aversion. The fact of the matter is that a huge portion of our society simply can't read at a sufficient level to get the understanding they desire. Saying "look it up" or "Google it" is no better than telling a 5 year old "you'll understand when you're older." It simply does not meet the need of the "OP."
When you lead into your answer with a disclaimer that you "left out entirely Kant's epistemological pessimism, and Schopenhauer's reaction to it," you have effectively said "I know you want posted to ELI5 but, screw you, it's too hard so I'm not going to try.
To everyone who's saying, "we're intelligent people here, let's ELI12" or ELIaLayman... Please: Take a look at the front page or /r/all. You have to conclude that there is a HUGE population of redditors who come here for pictures of scumbag cats trolling the internet. There IS an audience for ExplainLikeIm *5*.
In fact, I suggest there is a NEED for ELI5. Answerers should accept that they have to punt on details, ignore the subtleties and struggle to keep their answers short enough so the reader can finish it before the other browser tab with the latest meme finishes loading.
If you sucees in that, then the poster just might get enough information to realize that they really can understand. Once they believe they can understand, then they'll make more effort to understand better. 
**** ELI5 isn't literally 5. It's help me believe I can get this. Give me some faith that this is not out of my depth. If you want complete, detailed answers, go to /r/answers.
Zilean was on skype with me and doing exactly what he should have been doing, though he was doing it a bit early.  When I asked him why he did it so early it was because of my dash; he had no idea if I'd be in range when I needed it.  
Intelligent players will see a Zilean ult know they have to make a decision: Focus this target down and have them come back with more health than they had, or let them pound on you for 7 seconds.  Either way, a Zilean ult on a character that gets focused (like Akali) gives them a lot more freedom to deal damage in situations where they normally wouldn't.  Akali's role in a team fight is to assassinate the carry and low HP targets.  In order to fufill that role she does massive burst damage, but to counter that she's squishy as all fuck.  A Zilean ult means she has 7 seconds to burst down ANYONE, which is long enough to turn any team fight in her favor.
TL:DR; a Zilean ult can be used both to save someone about to die or to remove focus from a target who the enemy team REALLY wants to focus.
When someone calls President Obama a Tar Baby or a Tar Boy, just remember the **original** story had the B'rer Wolf attacking Tar Boy but every time they did they got stuck to him; While Obama/Tar Baby's face remains unchanged (and their attacks can't hurt him...well, cause Tar Babys not real and Obama can take criticisms for ignorant people) B'rer Wolf just ends up dirtying himself, making *him* the laughingstock, not Obama. 
So let them say their stupid things, when they use them it only ends up hurting their own image, as it should. Since they're too ignorant to understand the metaphors in the story (Don't attack Tar Baby or you will be branded as stoopeed), they are shown to be incompetent through their own misuse of American stories. 
 Tar Baby smiling, B'rer Wolf angry and B'rer Rabbit laughing his tail off.

Behind the times a little? Pagerank was all but deprecated as of 2009. Companies who can try to compute your pagerank for you use the publicly known algorithm which was patented by stanford in Google's infancy. From Google's first patent through 2009 this algorithm had been changed based on many user tests to the point that the origional algorithm was only "part of a much larger system."  
Since 2009 we have gone through two major (at least public, who knows how many more) algorithm changes: Relevancy in 2011, and speed in 2010.

FORGET pagerank. Never think of the word after this sentence. Write good content that people actually want to find, and they will find it. The end.
*: The pagerank number is a dice toss from 3rd party websites who are not in-the-know*
Good catch. Count the upvotes as TLDR's
This probably won't get read, since there's already so many comments, but ah well.
I've been overweight my entire life. I got made fun of mercilessly in elementary school and junior high. In high school, my classmates matured and so the overt teasing stopped, only to be replaced by whispered judgments and covered laughs, which I think was worse. I was always very outgoing and pretty much the class clown, so most people thought I was incredibly self confident, but really my jokes were something I hid behind, a defense mechanism if you will. I figured that if I purposefully made people laugh, I could convince myself they weren't laughing *at* me.
I graduated high school quite the unattractive girl. I was fat, my hair was limp and dull, my skin was paler than milk, I wore awful clothes that didn't fit, and I radiated insecurity.
I decided to move to Orlando from Seattle. And here in Orlando, something happened. Spending all of my time out in the sun, my hair became a vibrant blonde and my skin went from vampire pale to a more healthy peaches and cream. I got a job in a theme park and I had to run around a lot, and while I didn't lose weight because my diet was atrocious, I became a bit less blobby, a bit more curvy. And, living with two gorgeous, fashion conscious women, I started exploring clothing options that fit and flattered my shape, instead of either completely hiding or overly exposing my dimpled form.
I've lived here in Orlando for 4 years now. Am I skinny? Not at all. At 5'7" and 225 pounds, I am definitely considered (god, I hate this word) obese. Am I proud of my weight, my shape, my body? No. I desperately want to lose weight, to tone up, to be thin. But do I hate myself? Do I hate the way I look? No. In the last 4 years, I've learned how to embrace the skin I'm wearing for now. I just started trying to lose weight (I'm down from 240, which is exciting!) but instead of having my old mindset of "Oh god, I'm hideous," I'm able to truthfully say "I am a beautiful woman, and hopefully with quite a bit of hard work and diligence, in the future I'll be even prettier, and healthy to boot."
I still have my days where I look in the mirror and I want to cry. On my most self conscious days, I really focus on the fact that I'm 23 and have never had a boyfriend before...but I try to keep my chin up and a cheery smile on my face. I know that in the end, confidence can do nearly as much (if not more!) for a person's looks than a size zero pair of jeans can. Yes, I'm trying get down to a healthy body weight, but in the meantime I refuse to be apologetic over the person that I am.
Now, just for the sake of comparison, here's the difference a little less self loathing and a little more sun and fashion sense can make in a person. The first image is me when I was 18 and hated myself. The second image is me about a month ago, 23, loving life and *myself* (please excuse the silly pose, it's the most recent full body picture I have of myself.) I weigh about the same, but the difference is extreme.

Being fat sucks. Being miserable sucks more. While both are issues that should be addressed, deciding not to be miserable is a MUCH quicker way to happiness than waiting until you're a size 2.
I am madly in love with a woman who weighs over 220lbs and her height is 5'5", and too make things more difficult she has very low self-esteem. I am also a fit man, I have been skinny all my life and for a long time I had no idea how truly hard it is for my girlfriend. In our first year of dating I always let her know how beautiful she is(she truly is) and how happy she makes me, but one day when I was telling her how beautiful she is. She cut me off and told me to stop calling her beautiful and that it's a lie and I am too blind to see so I don't really know what I am talking about. Even though its true my eyesight is really bad to the point where glasses no longer help me. I quickly replied and told her that even though my eyesight is not at 20/20 I can see things clearly when they are close to my face and since I am usually on your face half the time I can see you clearly, but she begged me to stop and almost started to cry. It dawned on me that she is self-conscience of her body and not once she never saw her self beautiful. I just assumed that she was fine with her body, and being skinny all my life I have no idea what is like to be fat in western society, especially what women go through. After she pleaded she began to tell me that she was once skinny in high school and even joined her high school varsity baseball and volleyball and she was insanely good. However she started to gain weight and continued to gain weight throughout college and yet despite all her efforts of dieting and exercise she was barely losing weight so she gave up. She continued ever since the weight gain she never saw herself pretty and the last time she did was over nine years ago. She hate it how people sometime give her these looks when she buys fast food for me, the look that says "She is too fat. She needs to eat something else". They assumed it was hers and she doesn't even eat fast food. She cringes at the idea of shopping for clothes because whenever she goes out to buy clothes to look nice for me for our date, she can only find the perfect dress at size 10 or less, and she begins to feel ugly again and feels she doesn't deserve to be with a guy like me and I deserve someone that is not a size 16. It also doesn't help that her mom always tells her dieting tips and that she looked like she gained more weight from time to time, and to make matters worse a random guy passed by us while walking to Publix and said to me "Hey buddy you can do so much better then her" I got pissed and quickly snapped at him "How dare you disrespect my girl like that, she is hot and if you dare to rebuttal I will put you in your place." After my girlfriend reminded me what happened at Publix she told me she felt the most ugliest person in the world and these are just the few examples of many. At that point she started to break down and I hugged her and held unto her. I was in shock that I had no idea that she was going through this and I should have done more to help her. I told her I am not going to stop calling her beautiful and I will be with you. You mean to me more than anyone and anything in this world and I don't see anyone else but you and you alone. I will always be here for you and I am really sorry that I wasn't aware you were going through this.
We have been together to two years now and I plan to propose to her soon, and it took my girlfriend awhile to believe that I actually see her beautiful but some doubts remain however. To all the guys who are with plus size girls, You just have to be there for your girl when the low self esteem gets to her, and you have to let her vent all whats on her mind and have it off her chest. Once she sees that you are still listening, supportive, and showing her you really love her through your actions. It will help open her eyes that she really is sexy and shouldn't be ashamed by a simple look from judgmental eyes. 
For all the plus size girls you really are beautiful. Don't let society tell you that fat is ugly and you are inferior. You are far from it, you are strong. Stop underestimating yourself you mean more to those around you than some skinny chick you see passing by. If your boyfriend say that you are beautiful, sexy and hot. It is really the truth and words only fail to truly express the emphasis of the purity in the truth of your beauty. 
EDIT: Fix grammar errors, sorry about that I got caught with the stingy memories 
TL:DR
If you care for your girlfriend who are on the plus size you should really read this.
The following is my experience. 
At my heaviest, I was over 210 lbs, I'm not exactly sure what I weighed.
For most my mid to late teens, I have been around 180 lbs pounds at 5'5''.
Now, at 19 years old, I'm 125 lbs, and have lost 60 lbs in the past 8 months.
When I was heavier, (it's hard to say "when I was fat", as I still feel quite fat), I was treated quite differently. Most people just treated me like I was invisible, and that suited me just fine. I was very shy and withdrawn, and I didn't really want any attention brought on me. However, I received plenty of negative comments from friends and family. I was told that I'd never get a boyfriend, that nothing looks good on me, that I had a fat chipmunk face, that I had ridiculously huge "child-bearing" hips, and I got daily, unsolicited diet advice.
I rarely got hit on by guys and was friend-zoned by many, but when I did, they would inevitably bring how how they like women with "meat on their bones", reference Queen's "Fat-bottomed girls", or do other things to nearly fetishize and bring attention to my weight. 
Other guys blatantly stated that they found me unattractive, but that they would fuck me anyways.
Clothes shopping bordered on traumatizing. Nothing fit, and things that did were unflattering or matronly.
The internet was my safe-place, but even there I was constantly reminded that I was ugly, unattractive, and "less than". I felt worthless.
Since then, I have lost a lot of weight and I want to lose about 20 more pounds, but a lot of the feelings I felt when I was heavier are still there. I still feel like the fat girl, I still feel unattractive, I still feel like I'm less than and I don't belong. My self-esteem has gotten better, but most days I still feel like I'm that 200 pound girl. 
When I saw that picture on the front page, I felt like that was me. I'm that overweight girl. And that sucks.
 Being a fat girl sucks. Being a fat girl sucked so much, that even though I've lost weight, I still feel worthless. 
I'm in the same boat as many - Used to be very obese (225+) at 5'7", Only have 15 more pounds or so to lose.  I was skinny up until about the age of 7, then I ballooned.  I was dieting from the age of about 12, trying different things.  The most I ever lost at one time was like 10-15 pounds.  Losing weight so gradually and in installments, I only had fleeting feelings of having been successful and would soon come to feel fat again until I would lose another few pounds.  Everyone tells me how great I look compared to how I used to be, but honestly, I don't believe them.
I can only speak for myself, but as a once-fat girl, I generally felt and still feel worthless.  Of course it depends on the day or the outfit, but not a day goes by without my feeling insecure about some part of my body.  Even with only 15 pounds to lose, I feel certain that everyone is noticing how fat I look, or how big and whale-like my arms must be.  I cringe when I look in the mirror.  Obviously I must look better than I did, but I don't really see it like that.  I can't have fun at parties because I'm preoccupied about random bulging parts of my body.  Being fat just sucks.  Every day I wake up feeling motivated to lose the last 15 pounds and when I fuck up and eat a cupcake or something I feel like I want to die.  I feel like no one could ever really want me except other overweight people.  The thing that I want most in the *whole world* is just to lose the last 15 pounds but it so so hard.  I know my appearance won't make me happy, but can't imagine that being slimmer wouldn't be a major boost to my overall confidence and happiness.
For now, I continue as I am not wearing the clothes I really want to wear because I tell myself that even if I wear nice clothes it won't matter or make me look good because they'd be on a fat person.
- Shit's shit.
I've been overweight since I can remember- it's... not fun to say the least. All those comments on that picture up there especially make a person like me feel like shit. Try and go five minutes on that thread without someone talking about the overweight girl like she's sub-human because of her weight.
In my experience- it's *very* difficult to have any semblance of confidence. The only time I feel decent about myself is when I get super dressed up. When I'm wearing normal everyday clothes I feel terrible. Haircuts, clothing, make-up, I've tried it all. Still feel horrible about my appearance. 
I do have a medical problem, so it's difficult for me to lose weight. Clothes shopping is utterly horrible. I feels so ashamed when I walk into plus size stores. No matter how cute the clothes are, I hardly ever feel like it looks good on me. It's awful walking past all those stores with clothes that look wonderful knowing I would get weird looks if I even walked in there.
I'm very lucky to not have gotten very many comments on my weight over the years, but you can *see* it on people's faces. I've had crushes, huge crushes, and it always made me feel so worthless. I knew most guys wouldn't look at me and find me attractive because of weight, even if I supposedly have a cute face. 
I think romance is the area where it affects me most. I can deal with clothes not fitting- guys not giving me a second glance or treating me like I'm invisible? It hurts. Really hurts. 
So that's my experience.  You don't want to be an overweight girl. Trust me. Guys can get away with it- but girls? No. 
Imagine feeling horribly self conscious every second you are around other people. I feel like everyone is looking a t me and thinking about ow fat I am. I have difficulty eating in public because I feel like people are thinking "That girl is so fat, she shouldn't even be eating". I am self conscious at the grocery store, or when I pick up fast food for my husband and I because we are exhausted from work. I get tired very easy, my feet hurt all the time, my back hurts all the time. When I do have sexy times with my husband I wonder how he could be attracted to such and ugly, fat person, and how he could have done so much better than me. Looking at myself in the mirror makes me feel like crap. Shopping for clothes sucks, and makes me feel worthless. I have caught myself believing that many times. I feel like I am less than everyone else. 
I was pretty skinny until I turned 13. Puberty kicked my butt, and in high school I had a knee problem. My Dr said I had to immobilize it and not work it very much. I took a weight training class instead of the normal P.E. 
I start college around 235 and lost 15lbs my first semester because I took a fitness class. I kept working to lose the weight, and nothing seemed to work. Not a pound more did I lose. I kept taking fitness classes and water aerobics classes every semester for my health, but nothing else changed. No amount of exercise, calorie counting, and diet changes did anything. 
Fast forward 3 years and I was 265 and got married to my first and only boyfriend (first kiss too). I had dated a few guys before but nothing serious. Our first year of marriage was hard with my husband having 2 knee surgeries. I put on 40 more in 2 years, and was over 300 by the 3rd. During this time, I kept trying to eat healthy, eat less,exercise more. Nothing worked long term and the most I could ever lose was 10 lbs. 
When I was 24 my parents offered me my Dad's bonus from work so that I could have a gastric banding (Lapband) surgery to help. They only did this because they knew I had been looking into it for a while. I lost 65 lbs the first 1 1/2 years, and then had a leak. I gained almost 30 back just eating salad and vegetables trying not to gain while I waited for a replacement port surgery. Now it has been a full year since the replacement surgery and I haven't dropped a pound that actually stayed off. My Dr said, "Maybe you are just one of the 5% it doesn't work for. I feel like a failure, even though I am staying active. 
The years of discomfort and sacrifice from having the lapband feels like a waste. But then I remember how much I was gaining per year, and I am grateful that I have it.
**Being fat sucks butt!**
I have been death fat for pretty much my whole life. No, I never forget it. You know what sucks more than being a fat girl? Being a weird fat girl. It always seemed to me like the only fat girls who are "accepted" are the ones who are funny or extremely nice. (And even then, they're never really accepted.) I'm neither of those. I'm abrasive and have an odd sense of humor.
I've never had a friend in real life. I had "friends" in middle school who would be nice to me one day and then pull stupid shit the next day (like stealing my giant bra and throwing it on a bus, then telling the whole class about it). I've never really experienced a social life. Because of this, I'm really socially awkward. I don't know what it's like to have someone who I can depend on. All my **real** friends have always been from the internet. I kind of thought this was horrible for a long time, but nowadays, I really truly appreciate them. They are real friends. They've been there for me for years. Even if they'd never be friends with me irl.
I am no longer ashamed of being me. I no longer wish to be thin. I hope some day to get more in shape. But I love me, now. I just know that no one else does. I'm hilarious, smart, insightful, inventive. I notice things no one else does. These are things I love about myself, and these are what I place my self-value on. No one else will ever understand that about me because I am forever dismissed because of my fat. No, that's not self-pity. That's how things have always worked for me. Yes, I'm still scarred from my adolescence. You don't lose those scars.
I live behind the internet, I guess. I don't give out my picture often. Because of this, people can't simply dismiss me because I'm fat. If they dislike me, it's because I'm annoying or harsh or critical or whatever reason. Not because I'm fat. And I like that. I want someone to fucking judge me on my personality. If I think about it, I get sad about how many people I've made friends with who would never be my friend irl.
And you know what? I know I sound really angry right now. But that's because I've spent the last hour reflecting on what it's like being a fattie. I am one of the happiest, most resilient people you'll ever meet. I'm pretty much 100% awesome 95% of the time.
**** I'm fucking awesome and you'll never know it. Next time you see a fattie and are disgusted: beware, she might be awesome.
It really sucks sometimes, but not for the reasons most people would think. It sucks because for some reason, clothing designers think that fat women want to dress like someone's grandma. It sucks because every image that you see doesn't look like you, so you start thinking early on that something is wrong with you because you aren't six feet tall and a size 2. Also, everything that you DO see that seems to be directed at you as a fat woman assumes that you want to change your body through ridiculous fad diets or surgery. Even your own friends and family make these kind of assumptions. Women are so bombarded by these ignorant and stupid messages that pretty much any girl who isn't a fitness freak is made to feel fat, and therefore ugly and undesirable. The "beauty standard" is getting skinnier and skinnier. Manufacturers deliberately make their clothing sizes weird so that women can see a smaller number when they buy things. Models used to be size 8-10, then 6, then 2, then 0 and now 00. Even so-called "plus size models" are usually not even really plus sized, they are a size 12. So even AMONGST OUR OWN KIND the message is perpetuated, and every new generation of girls grows up feeling fatter and uglier than the last generation.
Conversely, portion sizes at restaurants have gotten larger and larger, and healthy, locally sourced foods have been de-emphasized. Fatty, sugary, overprocessed foods are the cheapest and most convenient and our entire social culture is pretty much based around eating. So it's wrong to be fat, but normal to want to eat a burger that weighs 2/3 of a pound?
- When you're a fat girl, it feels like the world hates you and marginalizes you and eventually you start to hate and marginalize yourself. We have to work twice as hard to have any form of self esteem and also we have to put up with other people's ignorant assumptions. But as a fat girl, I love myself. The world can kiss the fattest part of my ass. 
I've been overweight pretty much my entire life.  From around the summer before 3rd grade on up to now at age 24.  I used to blame a lot of it on my parents divorce, as I was more than likely depressed.  That wasn't the only reason, I was also very babied.  My mom did pretty much everything for me and when she remarried suddenly we were introduced to cable tv and junk food.  I over did hardcore.  And probably weighed a good 90-100 lbs when I started 3rd grade.
I was severely made fun of and it being a new school with no friends I hated everything.  It's pretty safe to say I was super depressed.  Amazingly though, throughout the years I managed to make friends and get out of my little depression.  Until junior high, that is.  While all my friends were starting to have relationships and popularity, I didn't.  I never knew what it was like to have a guy want to be with you.  I honestly thought I was maybe a lesbian because boys didn't like me.  (Dumb 14 year old thinking)  I think it was even harder because my sister who is 5 years older than me was absolutely perfect.  She was thin and pretty and outgoing and a lot of people liked her.  She had a new boyfriend every couple of months.  I was so mad that I wasn't her.  
I think the worst thing about it during my adolescent years was how little self esteem I had.  My mother wasn't one for complimenting or encouraging, so I never heard things like "You're beautiful" and lovey parenty shit.  So it was nice to hear it from somebody, anybody.  After having a super creepy and inappropriate internet relationship with someone who was literally over twice my age (at 14!!) I realized that there are people who could find me attractive.  
It's super difficult when you go to the mall with friends, especially those that are smaller than you, and they're like "Ohhh let's go into Hollister" or "Charlotte Russe" or "2.7.9" (A store specifically for people who wear a 2, 7, or a 9...fuck you people) And I have to be all , "Yeeeeeahhh...shoes!" or maybe I'll hide my body behind the jewelry and pretend I'm shopping "for a friend".  That's probably the worst part of it now.  Going to stores that you KNOW don't carry your size and you just feel so judged for going in.  It's ridiculous how a store can, at times, make me want to shrivel up like I'm not worth it.  
I don't want this to be a sad sop story because it's not.  Yeah, it really really sucked along the way, but where I am now is pretty ok.  I'm 24 years old now and I'm in a very healthy, committed and loving relationship with a fellow redditor.  I unfortunately gained a lot of weight in the recent months.  I had lost 40-50 lbs a few years back and maintained at 214 for the longest time.  But mysteriously I gained it all back within 3 months.  I thought I was pregnant.  But as it turns out I have "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis".  My thyroids are going batshit crazy and producing too much hormones.  I'm on medication now but I'm now 242.  Blerg.  But that's not something I can't change and I know that!  
Holy shit...that's long.  
-I've been fat my whole life, I have a thyroid problem as of recent, but it's still my fault I'm fat.  And if you're skinny don't make your fat friends go into tiny people clothing stores.
I'm in the opposite situation. Was about 65 pounds overweight my entire childhood. I've always had shitty self esteem because of it.
In the past year I've dropped just over 40 pounds, and it's made a world of difference in how I feel. I have more energy, I'm not always so ashamed of how I look... I can go clothes shopping and actually buy clothes that I *want* to wear, not clothes that I *have* to wear because they happen to be the ones that fit. I've noticed a difference in how people treat me - I always figured it was just my new-found confidence getting my mind to play tricks on me, but after reading your post I'm not so sure. People are more willing to talk to me like I'm an actual *person.* I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's really the only way I can explain. I'm sure it's got something to do with my mindset, too, - I've found that the less I weigh, the easier it is to socialize without having that constant nagging fear in the back of my mind telling me that who I'm talking to is secretly judging me. I still get that fear sometimes, mind you.
I know it may sound a little over-dramatic, but being a fat child really fucked me up. Even now, I've got such a distorted body image that at times I can't even bear to look at myself. I used to wish desperately that I could develop an eating disorder, just so that I could be thinner. I'm going to be straightforward here: I calorie-count like a madwoman and simply refuse to eat more than 1,200 calories a day. Most of the time, even that feels like too much, but I know any less can get a little risky. I have resorted to purging in the past, and it still happens every now and then (though *very* infrequently.)
As it stands, I'm about 20 pounds away from my goal weight. If I've noticed this much of a difference in my life (energy levels, confidence, the way people treat me,) while still being 20 pounds overweight, I can't imagine how it will feel to finally reach my goal. I'm sure it will be nice to not have to analyze/worry about my calorie intake every time I take a bite of something.
Now I'm just sort of ranting about my weight problems, so I'm going to stop now.
** Life is better skinny and being a fat child will really fuck you up. **
I'll go on and second this suggestion.  I subscribed to r/loseit because I was inspired by the supportive atmosphere and the success stories.
Then I started to hate everyone on there because of their success stories, where I was having none (because I wasn't actively trying), and I couldn't even look at the before/after pics of the smug bastards anymore.
Then I started feeling like "wow, a lot of people are really doing it.  Maybe I can do it."  And I finally got myself motivated enough to do something that's working for me (thanks r/keto!).
 r/loseit made me feel happy/shitty/hopeful and now I've finally felt able to lose weight for the first time in years and I'm doing it (via r/keto)  Woo!
I had a similar experience.. I was an overweight child. I am 5'5 and topped out at 170-180 in high school.  I had the lowest self esteem imaginable and it was hard for me to muster up the courage to do something about it.
My senior year, I started losing weight and from August to June, I lost about 35-40 lbs and ended up at 135.  I dropped even lower to about 127 in college.
After getting married and buying a house, the stress led my weight back up and now I'm stuck at around 145-150. I hate it and I'm terrified of losing control and becoming big again.  
I constantly call myself fat and big and my husband gets so frustrated that he can't even listen to it. Which makes me feel worse.  But he was a skinny, skinny kid and I just don't think he knows what it felt like.  
I completely agree that being the fat kid can screw you up emotionally.
Another one with the same experience here. I'm 5'6" and topped 225-230 in high school. I didn't care about how much I weighed then, though, because no one ever said anything to me about it other than my family. I never got the "Fat Kid" treatment, or at least never noticed it, because I hung out with a bunch of guys who didn't notice I was female. (It worked for me, honestly-- I didn't have any interest in being treated like a girl.) 
My freshman year of college, I started doing martial arts and dropped about 60-70 lbs. I was down to 160 or so, and I finally had someone express a positive opinion about my appearance for the first time in my life. 
I gained the weight back my junior year after some bad shit went down. When I left school and spent some time with my parents, all the weight came off again, and then some, thanks to daily exercise. I managed to get down to 125 for the first time since... grade school. I also developed the worst body image issues I've ever had in my life and some variety of EDNOS.
Since going back to school, my weight has been swinging back and forth between 140 and 160. My self-confidence in my appearance is non-existent. I feel like I'm always on the edge of going back to the way I used to be, and it terrifies me. I can't look at myself in any sort of reflection, and I haven't had a picture taken in months. I think I look hideous/repulsive, even though I'm at a normal weight for my height/body structure. And there's nothing I can do about it, since either losing or gaining weight will probably only make the problem worse.  
Losing weight can cause more problems than being fat for some people. 
&gt;I'd never been in the habit of moderating my food intake or exercising regularly, so it took me a long time to start losing weight. I'd start exercising and get frustrated at the lack of immediate results. I also felt angry with myself for how easily I was exhausted -- I was used to being able to walk for miles, or rollerblade for hours. All of the sudden, I got out of breath and panty after only 10-20 minutes of exercise.
I weighed 180 before I was 9. I stayed at 180 until I was about 21, when I went down to 170. Shit happened, and I ended up being over 200. I grew up with my mother, who does not moderate food intake, and is only just now considering what kinds of foods she's eating, because she spent her whole life more or less skinny. Because she never had to bother, she didn't really do a good job teaching us. 
I've been paying more and more attention to my diet since I was 19, but diet alone isn't enough. Neither is exercising, I found out the hard way. You have to do both, and diets that focus on losing weight don't really work. Find a diet that focuses on being healthy, and is designed for establishing long term eating habits. 
When I went down to 170, I felt amazing. I don't think with my bone structure that I can be healthy under 160, but I liked how I looked at 170. I'd spent years walking miles every day, working on my feet for 6 to 10 hour shifts. Now, at over 200lbs, I feel so damn tired all the time. It's hard to get in the habit of exercising when you feel so exhausted that you're worthless for the rest of the day. Regardless, I walk about a mile and a half at least every other day, still. I know it's not much, but more than that and my legs start falling out from under me. On top of everything I have asthma and live in a high altitude area, which limits the kinds of exercises I can do. 
I've had friends offer to exercise with me, to help me stay motivated, because like just about every person on the planet, I get frustrated with the lack of immediate results. Unfortunately, my friends are either not motivated to exercise on as regular a basis as I need to, or they tease me... They mean it to be playful and to motivate me, but really, every single person who's overweight is VERY AWARE of that fact already. Exercising makes me so self conscious it's painful, *without* the teasing. I lose any trust I have with a person if they do that, because I make a point to make it clear that teasing me when I'm trying to exercise just makes me shut down. I can't help it. I have a panic attack, and have to stop what I'm doing just to calm down... and if I don't calm down, I either get violent, or more often, hyperventilate and trigger a massive asthma attack. 
Exercising on my own, I feel shitty and worthless because I can't as well as I think I should. I end up getting massively depressed. This motivates me to *not* exercise. 
*** Every single day comes down to feeling "not good enough" and exercise has a bad habit of driving that home. I can't ever forget that I'm overweight, because everyone and everything reminds me of that. 
I've always been the "big" girl. 
I've never been outright bullied about it (except for my family), and my friends have never said anything about it, but the outside criticism is nothing compared to **your own self-hate**. I *know* my weight has influenced my personality. I've always been self-aware of my body, with every movement I make- does my rolls show? Does my body jiggle when I do that? When I go out and eat, do I order what I should or eat what's expected of me? I can't wear horizontal stripes, I *always* wear sweaters so I can hide my arm fat and for a bit, hide the width of my body. I shouldn't do this activity because it'll emphasize my body fat as I do it. You can't ever borrow clothes from friends. They're staring at you not because you're pretty, it's because your double chins move when you talk (or your weight disgusts them). I don't want to go shopping even though I love fashion (fashion looks good, but not on me). I'm the photographer whenever my friends and I go out- because I don't want people taking pictures of me, but I still want the memories of the event. Whenever we sit down, I hide my belly behind a pillow or purse. I'm a natural introvert, but I'm not naturally "shy". My fat makes it hard for me to accept me. I'm not just wrong, but I'm wrong and fat- jesus, why do you live (not only am I fat, but I can't even be helpful?). I'm not "entitled" to certain things because I can't "control" my fatness. My fatness consumes my mind as it does my body.  
I've never told anyone any of this because it's hard to sympathize fat people. Whatever I do, I feel like I have to prove myself useful and capable more than anyone else, because I can't do that with my body/body image. You have to prove yourself more because you're fat- so people say, she's fat, but she's useful. I try to live as I want to, but it's hard to want to do anything when you're fat. 
Appearance is not everything, but it's hard for people to get past. And when people see fat people in public, I know what's going through  their mind, because it's what goes through mine. 
For example, you might read this post and say, you don't have to live like this, you chose to be fat- if you just had some self control you can "free" yourself from your fat-thinking. I'm working on it, I promise I am, but I find myself exercising in secret, and eating healthily when I'm alone. I don't know why, but maybe because my self-pity is more than I can handle.
 Being a fat girl is everything you imagined and worse.
As a 5'7" size 16 I can admit that I'm overweight, but I don't feel fat or have people call me far or treat me like I'm subhuman because of some perceived fatness. You were skinny all your life- it sounds like you're suffering from a new lack of confidence, not a sudden onset of fatness. I hate to be this blunt, but it doesn't sounds like people are disgusted with you. It sounds a lot more like you are disgusted with yourself. You can be a fit size 16. I run about 1 or 2 miles 3 or 4 times a week, but I'm also getting into my later twenties now, when chicken wings are delicious and work is demanding. It has to balance out somewhere.
You're a mom now. You're getting older. I remember being only *23* and hanging out at the bar with my friends and when it got to be 11 PM we were tired. I remember all of us laughing and saying, "Man, we got old in the past 2 years, didn't we?" At some point you have to embrace who you are, not what you look like. I would rather spend my time around 400 or 500 pound people than those 50 year old women who fake tan, wear bikinis and want the gas station to still card them for cigarettes. You are a person, not a size on a tag or a number on a scale. People your size can do these activities that you miss. It sounds like you are too focused on losing weight, not building strength and stamina. You need to decide which one matters more.
 It's actually because my ass is out of this world.
I'm right with you. I'm a fat girl and I'm all boobs and ass as well. No plus size clothes seem to be made for me except for a few lines of very cheaply made fall-apart-in-one-wearing clothing sold in stores aimed at African-American women.
I've dated a number of extremely conventionally attractive men and had who I thought were my *own fucking friends* make jokes about "beauty and the beast." 
I was once eating a salad while out with a thinner friend who was eating junk and had strangers tell me to eat salads more often. 
When I'm minding my own fucking business, people go out of their way to interrupt my day to offer me super-helpful weight loss tips like "go on the grapefruit diet!"
I've had multiple guys tell me they loved me but couldn't be with me because I was fat. One was my best friend.
I nearly married a man who, after I had come home from a 14 hour workday, sat down and made myself a cup of tea and toast, tell me that there were too many calories in my "meal" and that I should be spending the time working out.
I joined a gym not long ago, and the harassment has been so bad I leave weeping nearly every time I go. I get snide remarks, guys craning their necks so hard to see me work out that I'm afraid one of them is just going to snap. When I work out in a semi-private room (tiny window on the door) they are *constantly* looking in. 
Just a few weeks ago, a car full of women in their 20s or so started screaming obscenities and names at me as I left the mall. They followed me down the street, driving beside me, and rolled down their windows to continue the abuse. 
When I was seventeen and a size 12, a doctor put me on "diet pills" that were essentially speed. Yeah, that worked out real well.
I've been out to lunch with coworkers who said they would rather kill themselves than gain x amount of weight...which is still less than I weigh now.
My thyroid medication is altered every few months, nothing ever seems to get me to normal levels. If I talk about it at all, people laugh and say lol you're not a magical unicorn, thyroid has nothing to do with weight loss/there are no thyroid problems in Ethopia/calories in-calories out. It's great, I totally love it!
To top it all off, my two best friends are incredibly conventionally attractive. Both were strippers to put themselves through college. Everywhere we go, I'm invisible. On a cruise, I once had men pour drinks on me so that I would go back to the cabin and change so they would get some alone time with my friend. Everywhere they go, they're offered free stuff, special treatment, jobs they're not qualified for. I try not to be resentful, but people are *not* subtle about it.
And, of course, I'm a redditor. A pretty active one. And the fat hate here really is glorious. People go out of their way to bash one of the few remaining groups it's acceptable to hate (the others are: republicans, Christians to a limited extent, and yeah, that's about it). So the community I love so much also seems intent on concern trolling me every single day (lol I didn't know fat was unhealthy, brb, I'm on the treadmill) and breaking down one of the few places I feel accepted and don't have to worry about what I look like.
So I'm involved in a Body Acceptance movement. Part of that is fat acceptance. You wouldn't believe the haterade reddit pours on us at times. We've been linked and mocked quite seriously in lots of subreddits but I give exactly two fucks, and I'm going to continue to promote the radical idea that you shouldn't be ashamed and have the right to feel beautiful no matter what your body looks like. 
 I'm fat and get harassed all the time. It's absolute shit. It degrades your self-esteem in ways I'm still discovering. 
I've been a fat girl my entire life. I'm also pretty tall (over 6') so I guess I'm luckier than some, but from my perspective that just makes me stand out that much more. I lost about 70 pounds when I was 14 and that was pretty much the thinnest I've ever been, ~215 pounds, and a size 14. Now i'm in my early 20s and hover around 300 pounds. 
Being a fat girl sucks. I've *never* been able to shop at all the "cute" stores - Abercrombie, Hollister, Aeropostale, American Eagle..all those places that seem like such a big deal when you're in junior high and high school. I go out shopping with my (thinner) friends and all I can think about is oh, how cute that would be if I was 150 pounds thinner.
I can't stand it when people don't think I have an opinion about things or that I can't tell that you're staring at me from across the room and saying shit behind my back, thinking that because I'm fat, I don't have a soul. It hurts. It hurts every single day. I don't like looking at myself in the mirror, and I don't even go to the doctor unless I abso-fucking-lutely have to, because I have to step on that scale and he's just going to judge me because I haven't lost any weight since the last time I saw him.
I've never really had a real boyfriend. I had one in high school, and two since then, but to me, I don't know, they just don't count. They said that I looked beautiful but I can never believe them. Even my friends sometimes say that I don't look fat, or that it's not a big deal, but I can never let myself believe them; I know it doesn't really make sense, but I immediately dismiss their compliments. I have zero self-confidence due to people berating me while I was growing up. (In 7th grade when the other girls got their new cheerleading uniforms, one of the girls' uniforms was a smidge baggy (aka not skin-tight), and I heard her from across the room say to the people around her  "it's like, [my name]-sized.") It's harder for me to make friends, even though I'm actually a really nice, friendly person who can be funny and has good taste in TV and movies.  I feel like because I'm fat, I have to compensate by being nice, so even if I want to be mean, I just let it by...because otherwise, I would be the fat bitch instead of the fat girl. And if there's anything worse (by American society standards) than a fat girl, it's a fat bitch. 
Most of my friends are guys, because they tend to be less bitchy. They see me as a person, instead of as a fat girl with no soul (although, I'm sure a lot of them see me as a fat girl). I also tend to prefer hanging out with guys because I don't spend damn near every minute that I'm with them wishing that I had their body, that I could wear the things they do, that just once I could get the attention from guys that they do. That I had their self-confidence, that I could just go up and talk to someone without them referring to me as "that fat girl" later. For once in my life I would like to be known as the tall girl, the smart girl, the girl with nice hair, the girl with pretty blue eyes, the girl with the nice smile...*anything* but the fat girl. 
The truth is, I'm a pretty awesome person, who is really nice, smart, talented, funny, great cook,  basically everything that everyone says they want in a girlfriend, but since I'm a fat girl, no one even gives me a chance. I'm secretly worried that I will spend the rest of my life alone, and I'll never get a chance to experience real love or happiness.
I'm sorry that I kind of ranted, but..it really felt good to get it out there, even if no one reads this. 
 being a fat girl sucks. I feel like I have to over-compensate for everything else because I will never be accepted by society. I also feel like I will be forever alone, with no boyfriend/husband, and no friends.
Damn skippy!
I've always yo-yo'ed between a healthy weight and about 40lbs overweight, and it wasn't until I was able to let go of my insecurity about my weight--at ANY number on the scale--that I was able to maintain an adult relationship with a man who doesn't take advantage of my insecurities about myself.
He likes 'em chubby and curvy, too, but he always maintains that what he's attracted to MOST of all is my happiness.
Since I started getting more fit a month ago, he's been incredibly supportive. He plans healthier, lower calorie meals and tells me every day how proud he is of me for doing something for my health. He says I've inspired him to do more for his health, too--he's quit smoking, does pull-ups and runs more--because he wants us to have a long, happy and healthy life together.
my boyfriend is awesome.
You're saying it a bit insensitively, but I'd have to agree.
The thing is, there are two kinds of fat/obese/overweight/big people: 1) the "just big and that's how they are, doesn't affect them at all" and 2) the disgustingly fat. I don't give a fuck about the first kind of person, I treat them like anyone else. However, the second kind... Shit man, it's not intentional, but I just feel like shit around someone like that. Y'all should know the kind. It's nothing personal or anything, just how it is.
I think part of this is how overweight for their frame the person is, where the extra weight is, how they dress and act, and finally the vibes about themselves they give off (combined sixth sense shit I can't explain [and a discussion about which should not be held in this thread please] and clothing/actions). As an example, if a person is really fucking overweight and it's all fat in the wrong places, but they're giving off good vibes and acting normal, that's cool. I don't really care. For their sake, I'd hope they could lose some weight, but really, I don't mind. However, if someone is overweight, even a little, but they give off terrible vibes, I'm not inclined to have any sympathy. It just makes me feel, like I said, like shit.
** It's really about how the person "wears" their weight. If they act cool and give off good vibes, it doesn't matter to me how overweight they are (although I really hope they'd lose some, for the health benefits, because I'm a nice guy and I want the bets for people). *However, if a person gives off shit vibes, being overweight only makes it worse.* I don't like being around people who give off shitty vibes. I know, I should be supportive, but it just makes me feel like shit.**
The first thing I will say to you is this: no matter how much you weigh, how you feel about yourself makes a world of difference in how people treat you. If you're overweight and giving off bad vibes about it, people are going to feel those vibes and respond accordingly, treating you like you treat yourself. If you go around with good vibes, then it doesn't really matter how much you weigh (to a point), as people will generally, again, treat you how you treat yourself.
Secondly: Don't ever give yourself shit about yourself. If you don't like something about yourself, then fucking do something about it. If there's one thing in this world that bothers me like this, it's when people treat themselves like shit. I can't fucking stand it. So, at least, be nice to the people around you, and don't give yourself shit.
 Weight is not as important as self-esteem. With good self-esteem, anything is possible, including losing the weight you never could while feeling like shit.
&gt;Being a fat girl means accepting that you're not attractive and no one wants to be your friend, even other fat people (bf not even a question, of course). I was only able to ever make friends by winning people over a longer period of time when we were in forced proximity- classes together, work, clubs, etc. My personality's not sparkling enough to make someone want to be my friend despite fatness over the course of a single encounter. Even then, I accepted being the friend whose preferences didn't matter quite as much. I never relied on anyone else for anything- emotional support, moving apartments, ride from the airport, whatever, because I just didn't trust them to value me. Which has nothing to do with my friends or how they treated me, I think. The way I saw it, people value friends according to various metrics, and being the "fat one" meant that I was valued much less, so people would be much less willing to invest anything in keeping me as a friend.
This really hit home for me..I've always felt this way. Winning over a friend felt like climbing mount everest, and even once I had them, I felt  I was some token fat person in a group, a caricature of a human being...On the romantic side, I had always assumed no guy would ever be attracted to me, or even if they liked my personality and were attracted to me I assumed they would still never go for me and even if they did they wouldn't want to be with me in public.
This has led to considerable bitterness towards people, and also a cloying desperate niceness in hopes that someone will see through the fat that I am an intelligent and rather awesome person. 
At one point in highschool I got down to about 135lbs (5'6") and I did notice a considerable difference in how guys looked at me and how people treated me in public. This actually only made me feel more bitter, thoughts like "These are the same people that ignored you when you were fat" were abundent.
Atm I'm at 185lbs, which has been the highest I've ever been, and it's been this way for the last 3 years. In the meantime I've met a wonderful ("normal sized") guy who absolutely loves me for who I am: body and personality. Finding a person who truly and honestly appreciates me as I am has made me have goals for my future and to feel generally happier and more up beat. My new-found cheerfulness has also led to people in public being nicer to me, I've realized that my weight wasn't the only thing holding me back, my anger, depression and lack of self confidence have also been huge roadblocks.
The 2 years I've been with my boyfriend have been a catalyst for very positive change in my life, and now with most of the emotional issues regarding my weight resolved, I'm probably in the right place to start resolving the physical ones as well... I finish University in two weeks, and I think this time I'll get the weight loss right too :)
weight issues spark emotional issues which spark a feedback loop of more eating and more depression. thank you sweet boyfriend for getting me out of the horrible spiral I was drowning in. 
obviously a throwaway:
I've been overweight since I was around 9-10. I'm 5'7'' and 240 lbs, which is around the heaviest I've ever been. Basically what I've noticed is that compared to my thinner, more attractive friends, I rarely get attention from men. I know the whole "confidence is key" thing and people swear to me that there are men who find me attractive, but they're too shy to say anything. I've stopped caring either way. I finally bribed one of my friends to sleep with me so I could cross that off the list and be done with it.
This part is probably a lot more dire than the average fat girl might comment, but that picture is basically what goes on in my head on a constant basis. Seeing my thinner friends (and not MUCH thinner, I'm a size 20, for perspective) get boyfriends, get doors opened for them (as other commenters mentioned) and generally be treated as attractive women really did a number on my self-esteem. I've been bulimic for around 12 years (I'm 23.) I'm not going to say my weight contributed to it, because it's a lot more complicated than that, but the constant anxiety that people might perceive ME the way they do the girl in that pictures makes it difficult for me to try and be social or make friends.
Oh, and for the general public: I get a public comment about my weight around once a month. Not just in the "have you lost weight?" which I get ALLLLL THE TIME but in terms of "omg look at that fatass, I hope I never look like her." I'd say that happens at least once or twice a month, usually at work. 
So the *version:*
Being fat my whole life has contributed to my feeling like shit, I have an eating disorder which both keeps me overweight and socially isolated, and when I see pictures like that it reminds me that that's probably how some people are going to see me. Personally I'd rather be alone forever than deal with that shit. As it is, I can't even handle the comments on Reddit some days.
I know that people on Reddit like to insult EA's customer service, but they are not that bad.. sometimes...
One time, I forgot my Origins password and requested a new one. I waited a day and still hadn't gotten the reset email, so I contacted EA support.
The first guy was OK and said that he was going to transfer me to a higher associate. I waited TWO HOURS(I counted) to talk to the "higher" associate. (I was using their chat system btw.)
Anyways, the new agent was very helpful and said that since I had waited so long, I would be entitled to ANY game from the EA Origins store. I asked for Crysis 2 (since it was the most expensive game at that time :P) and he gave me a code for it :D


EA made me wait 2 hours and gave me Crysis 2 for free due to my patience.
Apples and oranges. Medicine s a highly regulated field where to become a professional one must meet certain parameters as defined by a licensure board. If you chose to call yourself an "uneducated, unlicensed, uninsured doctor" you could maybe get away with it legally, but I doubt it.  
Photography, like cooking, gardening, and other "productive" hobbies result in an easily presentable body of work (photos, food), and don't carry a high risk of the participants dying. I can't think of one time someone trying to paint something directly caused the unintentional death of the subject, you know? 
  
 Photography is something you can practice until you reach pro-level without any significant consequence, unlike say, surgery, so don't compare two things with broadly different skill-sets.
They're all still subjective. Using what you would consider inferior bokeh or exposure, or an unusual focal point in a picture can be done to express the photographer's vision of the subject. These things can be done to great effect sometimes, so saying, for example, that all pictures with a harsh bokeh are objectively inferior to pictures with a creamy bokeh is not true beyond any technical context. Even in a technical context, it's missing the point to assert that all pictures should adhere to any arbitrary standard to be considered "good". They're good if they portray the subject and the photographer's vision of the subject in a clear or evocative way.
is that when you reduce art to technical criteria, you risk losing the art.
I had another comment somewhere in this thread, but to give you some perspective, I found the original hilarious. I started managing a studio and doing professional portraits for money at 17. This career choice was inspired by a high school photography class.
However, other people took that class. Three years in a row. And invested hundreds in cameras. And never got better at photography. Which is still wonderful, I like seeing people enjoy the art, BUT the problem is, they all *think they're good*. People ask me constantly what my opinion is of their work, and I sort of want to say "well, it's just as bad as it was 4 years ago, only it's less grainy now that you've got that $500 camera. How have you not learned proper exposures yet? Crooked does not equal abstract. AND STOP SEPIA TONING EVERYTHING!", but I can't.
I started doing professional work when I was a teen, and lots of other teens sucked ass at photography but thought they were on the same level as me. Not everyone has natural talent in everything. People no get this. Therefore, I think the original is funny, though I know personally it's not true for every teen. It can still be funny without being taken as a 100% blanketed remark.
Disclaimer: this is just my opinion, so don't go ape shit and just hear me out by reading this full post, then respond if you feel the need to. I used to play broodwar and during my broodwar days I never really raged or felt I got losses I didn't deserve. Now fast forward many years later to sc2, I never really get mad if I lose with terran or toss, however for some reason something about playing zerg and losing just gets to me. I don't know what it is but personally, I do feel that there is still a slight imbalance between zerg and terran. It isn't something that is super game breaking, and it could just be the maps and spawns which cause this however I feel like zerg has too many weaknesses in the early game. I like to play zerg simply because it was my favourite race in broodwar so I probably won't switch races, however when I offrace I never seem to get frustrated after losing.
Now don't get me wrong, if I lose I just GG and don't BM. I leave and then look at graphs or maybe watch the replay to see where I went wrong. There's something about losing to early terran agression that really ticks me off. I have been gaming for years, I'm one of the calmest guys you will ever meet, I almost never rage and actually usually laugh things off most of the time especially if I fuck up.
I feel like terran can do serious damage if not kill you outright in 3-4 different ways, and yet if they fail they aren't as punished as I feel they should be. Like for example, if a terran uses hellions and get 2-3 good shots off on my drones, it's basically game over at that point. If I stop the hellion harrass I'm slightly ahead, however I cant make a huge counter due to wall offs etc. 
One thing zergs have to realize is that in i'd say 90% of the cases where we feel like the terran did something BS, it could be avoided or countered if you were just a little bit better, knowledgeable, or scouted better. The first thing you should do when you lose is go through "okay what did I do that was wrong? What could I have done differently?", after everygame look inward first then look outward. This applies to pretty much everyone below masters because there is always a lot of room for you to improve your play. 
Now to you terrans, you have to understand that a lot of us zergs HONESTLY in our opinion feel like there is still an imbalance in the game. That + the fact that people like to use excuses rather than improve their play really add up to this sort of zerg mentality that a lot of immature zergs have.
Read the last 4 short paragraphs I can't really shrink it more than that.
I just reply to your post because i want to build upon what you said.
Zerg is supposed to be the reactionary race. But like GoMLism said, if you don't know what is coming you will die. Nothing else. I'm not just behind and can, if played perfectly, still win this game.
There are not only many different builds you need to react to. You have to be able to counter them all. Even at lower levels of play. Because for P/T it might be enough to just have one perfect build per race which you practiced well. But as a Zerg player you play different people that have worked on different builds.
In addition to that you cannot force your opponent to fight! There are some all-ins that can be really hard to defend, esp if not scouted. But other than that there is not much until you have brood lords out. This also means that the fight will most likely take place where your opponents wants and not where you want. This means that terrain advantages will most likely be used by your opponent and not you. That is why Zerg players need to stall an army by countering/harassment to build upon the defenders advantage.
So sometimes it feels like you just do what your opponent wants you to do and if you have a glimpse of hope because you countered everything he threw at you his main push is standing in front of your natural and kills you. It feels like your opponent just plays with you and then in the end says: "ok kid, we had enough fun. lets end this now". (I'm still waiting for the hellion marauder pushes from terrans now that roaches are in vogue again. Many tears will flow.)
I really hope that for HotS zerg will get a unit which is not very zerg like, so not cheap, quick and dies easily. It doesn't have to be a siege tank, but something slower yet more powerful would be a nice for the army mix. Then zerg players can choose if they want a mobile aggressive army or a slower but safer one.
"look at the stupid cat chasing the red dot. look what happens if the red dot is on the wall, and now here at the table. Stupid cat just overreacts, it would had been better if it focused on its macro because now i'm going to kill it with my voidray colossus army"
Yes. The Zerg requires MORE investment to get infestors than it takes to get ghosts.
Tech to infestors: pool (200 mins) -&gt; lair (100 mins/100 gas) -&gt; infestation pit (100 min/100 gas) -&gt; Pathogen Glands (150 min/150 gas)
Tech to ghosts: depot (100 min) -&gt; barracks (150 min) -&gt; ghost academy (150 min/50 gas)/tech lab (50 min/25 gas) -&gt; Mobeus Reactor (100 min/100 gas)
Not only is the path to ghosts CHEAPER than infestors, but you can get them out faster as well. Yes, every ghost made is one less marine with your army, but every infestor made is one less drone/roach/bling/muta/everything)
 stop QQ'ing and make ghosts
A friend of mine named James said he had a housemate who would always drink his milk and use the last of it so he'd have none for his coffee in the morning. When James would ask his roommate to stop, he would say 'It's okay, I'll pay you back' obviously missing the point that it was about not having any when he needed it. Then one morning James came down stairs to find 30 litres of milk in the fridge as his housemate had decided to pay him back all at once.
Roommate kept taking milk and paid back 30 litres all at once.
Sorry for the slow review. Sundays are always so hecktic. 
The Illusione "Burn" is a limited production cigar made specifically for Rocky Patel's Cigar Bar "Burn". Hence the name Burn. If you call up and try to get them to ship you a box, they wont. Unless you are some fancy person, where as you should already have sampled this by now. Otherwise you or someone you know has to visit the bar to purchase it. 
This exclusivity is what made me give it a shot. I chose the Torpedo, only because I herd the Churchill and Torpedos were the better of the vitolas. I had to pick through a couple of the sticks to find one that wasnt suffering from some wrapper peeling/flaking. Also they all seemed to have some veins in the wrappers. To be honest, it's not an overly impressive stick to look at. I'm not saying its bad by any means, I just think that when I am paying 10 dollars for a cigar, I expect things to be a bit more refined. 
Anywho, the cigar it self had great draw and wasnt overly spicy in the begining. It did take about half length before any real flavors came forward. But when they did they were pleasantly present till the end of the cigar. If I had to tag it with a flavor, I would say leather with a hint of nut. The ash was good, lasting about 1/3rd's And when the ash did fall off, the filler was nicely pointed cone. 
Overall, I would say this is a Medium bodied cigar. And if you are feeling left out by not being able to get your hands on one, I would say don't worry about it. You really are not missing anything spectacular here. I guess I was hoping to be amazed by this cigar and already envisioned taking a couple home to age in my humidor. I ended up spending the extra money on a glass of Patron XO Cafe instead. 
**- I'd give this a 79/100, and won't be trying it again.**
Wanted to be a dick and just reply "first", but frosty and clerk beat me by a minute or so dammit... anyway, now you get a real response...
I once did an outpatient D&amp;A course with a woman who drank a bottle of wine a night - that was enough for her to seek treatment. You're completely right in that quantity has nothing to do with it.
Agreeing with frosty in that community should be the first line in dealing with this kind of dick measuring. If someone is truly an irreconcilable cunt, then flag the post and/or message the mods. Decisions can be made from there based on the posting history of the individual.
None of the mods have anything against banning, it's just rarely justified. As I write this we have 4800+ subscribers, and only 28 banned users, several of whom are inactive or dead socks anyway.
On the whole, this community takes care of itself, and I like it like that. Most lurkers seem to understand this, see that we're a very peaceful group, and don't piss in our play pool. Of course with alcohol you always get your belligerent pricks, but in most cases those folk will have a bad night, wake up to to a hail of orangereds, realise the error of their ways and move on.
 serious problems with particular users? flag their posts and shoot the mods a heads up.
You don't become a "penny stock" by losing value, much less only $1 in value. When people refer to "penny stocks" they're usually talking about pink sheets. BofA isn't leaving the NYSE and as such is not (and never will be) considered a penny stock.
philosoraptor45 is quite literally retarded.
As an FYI to those who doesn't understand what this means, it means nothing.  There are pending lawsuits, yes, but Bank of America has been dealing with law suits regarding the mortgage crisis since it happened.  A drop in stock price has absolutely no impact on the actual business, however it will have an impact on the executives at the bank.  These folks are the ones who are appointed by the stock holders and ultimately will lose their jobs if they are no longer seen as effective.
Straight from the 10-Q:
&gt; Net income (loss) was $(8.8) billion and $(6.8) billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $3.1 billion and $6.3 billion for the same periods in 2010. The principal contributors to the net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were the following: $14.0 billion of representations and warranties provision in the second quarter largely related to the BNY Mellon Settlement as well as other mortgage-related costs, including a $2.6 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, higher mortgage-related litigation expense and increased mortgage assessments and waivers costs.
Basically, as Bank of America settles its lawsuits, net income will continue to be negative.  I don't have a huge amount of time to find the exact figure, but if you adjust the losses of 2Q2011 by the settlements, net income is positive.  This isn't saying the bank is doing great, these lawsuits have a definite impact on the financial strength of the company, but it shows the underlying health of the company outside of the mortgage issues.  
Another quick glance at the 10-Q (page 12) will show the non-interest income coming into the bank.  Total non-interest income was $1.990Bn, however if you adjust for the $13.196Bn in mortgage losses you see non-interest income of $15.186Bn.  This primarily comes from trading account profits, investment/brokerage services, services charges, and card income.  Again, the institution itself is healthy from a non-mortgage standpoint and is making a lot of money.  
Finally, a look at the balance sheet.  Bank of America has total assets at June 30th, 2011 of roughly $2.3 trillion dollars.  Digging deeper, Tier 1 capital is $153.1Bn with a minimum required of $55.7Bn.  That is a great deal of breathing room if losses continue for the next few years.  Finally, digging even deeper, nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are sitting at $30.1Bn, which is a lot, but a decrease from the $35.6Bn 6 months prior.  
TL:DR; Bank of America is not in trouble of collapsing. This is simply the market going crazy because of the S&amp;P announcement.
If banks were forced to mark the value of their mortgage portfolios to the true market value, god (or noodles) only knows whether the banks would be in the black or not. However, I suspect many banks (hundreds or possibly thousands) would be insolvent. I agree with StockTraitor that this is a way of building up reserves in the banks toward the day that the bank auditors can rescind the special permission granted a few years ago (at the height of the financial crisis) that allowed banks to choose for themselves the value of their loans rather than the previous requirement of marking them to fair market value. It seems obvious to many that the current scheme of ignoring true reserve value and paying the banks interest on excess reserves and also lending money to banks at less than the rate the banks can earn on US treasuries is a huge scheme to artificially increase bank reserves and to artificially lower interest rates of US treasuries by turning every bank into a shill bidder at treasury auctions on behalf of the US govt. In case you are not aware treasury bidding is done by "Reverse Auction" whereby the lowest bidder wins and the treasuries are sold to anyone who wants them at the lowest price bid. In other words, the lowest interest rate bid is the rate that the treasuries are sold for. So banks effectively act as shill bidders because they can borrow at ridiculously low interest rates from the government and purchase treasuries at a low rate that still gives them a guaranteed profit with NO risk. Then foreigners and anyone else who wants to buy treasuries have to purchase their treasuries at the artificially low interest rate set by the banks acting as the government's shill bidders. Since the government controls the rate that banks can borrow at and controls the reserve requirement (both real and fictional), the government is providing huge downward pressure on interest rates for US treasuries (i.e. the price the government pays to borrow money).
Wall of text not worth reading
There is some really good literature out there right now, being done by non believers and recovering believers. When you get to that level you don't have to worry much about the confirmation bias set unless you go to a "religious" university. Since you have an MA though why not just go for a PhD? what schools are you looking at? I did a religion minor during my undergrad, most of the profs were awesome, you get a couple that make you go wtf? but the good thing is that you get to speak out and make them look dumb for saying outlandish shit.
go for the PhD, the MA is worthless, do it at the right school.
Not to mention, pokemon caught on these games are still compatible, and fairly easily to trade with current generations.   they still have great utility.
Yes. Since the beginning of this current civilization at the end of the last ice age, there has always been some group of dickheads or another telling the rest of the people what to do. When that group was big enough they went out and enslaved some other people because they were tired of doing all the work for the guys on top. This worked great until most of the world already belonged to one empire or another. Hitler made the last push for global military domination in the name of National Socialism (that's what NAZI stands for btw) On the other hand you had the Fabian international socialists who established the UN in order to 'end all wars'. But they just made themselves the dickeads on top. 
Despite the war, the americans and germans were pretty close and the US snuck out a bunch of scientists and hundreds of former nazi corporations set up in the states. So now the internatioalists want to destroy America because she won't play by all of their rules. 
Most likely china and russia are going to nuke the shit out of the US in your lifetime. Id suggest learning how to survive and playing lots of Fallout. 
If it doesn't get that serious the read Brave New World and you will have an idea what the 'end' to the corruption and bullshit will look like if the internationalists get their way. 
been like this since the beginning of this civilization, maybe the last one was like that too... not going to get any better. 
   
A few points here...
First is, it depends on the type of zombie we're talking about here. If it's the sort that infects people with a bite, armor won't protect you indefinitely... which brings me to my next point.
Have you ever tried to run in ANY sort of armor? It's waaaay fucking harder than it looks. In addition to the loss of mobility, the dramatically-increased load means not only increased work and less actual, useful gear for the wearer, but the added stress on an untrained wearer can and will cause injury.
In all practicality, you'll lose about half of your speed and distance running in a modern plate-carrier or 'Nam-style flak jacket (Why you'd want one of those is beyond me though.), which means you'll be caught by the mob that much faster.
The only potentially-viable option is a full-body riot/bomb-squad-style suit. Your mobility will be almost nil, but it's the only way not to have major gaps. Even then, even though you can essentially just lie there and let the zed break their teeth on your visor, they're dead, they don't just give up. They'll sit there, pressing against you until they finally pull apart the suit or you die of deprivation and septicemia from being covered in your own waste.
 No.
Teenager, yes. Angsty, pimple-faced, and garden-variety, no (are garden teenagers like garden gnomes, but more annoying?).
Look at history. Then look at America. Now look at me. Do I seem ridiculous now?
America was built on class divisions, came to economic power through slavery, took land through genocide, and acquired political power through war. It then spent the Industrial Age exploiting immigrants and giving customers disease in the name of profit. After that, it joined WWI and WWII in self-defense, waiting until it was directly attacked before it did anything. In between those two wars, the economy collapsed because of an irresponsible, hedonistic populace. Then the Cold War started, and the propaganda and lies that were spread in the 50s are still around today, 60 or so years later, still causing problems in international relations (remember Pakistan? Yeah, that was partially the fault of the US). The Vietnam and Korean wars were fought out of those irrational fears and propaganda, resulting in many pointless losses of life on both sides. Then the Gulf War (which motivated 9/11, yes, really, Osama said so himself), and after 9/11, more wars in countries that were Arab or supposedly held nuclear weapons or some other excuse (spoiler alert: oil). And now using lobbyists, corporations can gain tons of power over government (see: all the stupid shit that benefits large corporations and nobody else).
Now, tell me, what is in that list that should I be proud of? Hmm?
 That's an ad hominem, so it's invalid. Also, nothing in American history deserves anything approaching pride or respect. Sorry that this is so badly written, but you don't really have an argument, so I think it evens out. 
I would recommend *php* as it is easy to learn, but pretty please, look up some best practices, as you can easyily develop some bad habits with it, which will make it harder to learn onether programming language.
Also you might want to take a look at one of the popular *CMS*s(Content Managment System, eg.: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, etc). I think they are quite mandatory for a site with lot of dynamic content(picture galery, news portal, portfolio site. They are easy to mantain and expand, and your users will like that they can update their site without your help.Most of them use php so I recommend learning that first.
** I recommend php for programming and CMS's to learn something new for webdesign**
Speaking for myself, I was raised Roman Catholic. Every Saturday, I went to religious education. Every Sunday, I went to church. I tried my very hardest to be a good little Catholic. I tried to believe in God. I read scripture and prayed at night. I believed what my mother told me Pops was most likely an atheist. He died before I could ask, which actually brought me to question God. Why would he take a 14-year-old boy's father be taken by a gracious God? Later, my best friend died of cancer at age 16. My sadness turned to anger, my anger to hatred, and, thankfully, my hatred to gradual introspection. I searched my conscience. Did I ever actually believe? Now that I was no longer an angst-ridden teenager, I had the clarity of mind to compare what the church told me with evolution and the Big Bang. My youthful studies did not hold up to my adult research. So as not to be unfair, I went back with an adult (and open) mind to look for proof of religion. I found none. The truth of the cosmos has given my life the "beauty" that religion had claimed could only come from God.
 Yes, I did. It didn't make any sense.
Free to play, try it out sometime. It's a game style that spawned off DoTA, a custom game from Warcraft III, basically you have your hero (5v5 or 3v3) and you're trying to kill the enemy's nexus/base before they kill yours. Add in lots of PvP, neutral monsters that give buffs, small creeps in lanes on each sides, and towers that defend the lanes and that's the game.
- TRY IT!
There are two modes: 5v5 and 3v3; 5v5 being the dominant one (3v3 wasn't there originally and 5v5 is, in general favored).
There are three lanes that spawn minions and a jungle in between with neutral monsters.
You control a champion that has 4 spells, one of which is an ultimate that cannot be used until level 6, and a passive. Each champion (there are 81) has 4 unique spells and passives; however, despite which champion you are playing, you get 2 spells that you choose before and you can pick despite which champion you play. Ghost allows you to run fast for an amount of time, Ignite deals true damage based on your level and cuts down healing effects by 50%, Exhaust makes the target move slower and do significantly less damage, etc.
The goal of the game, ultimately, is to destroy the enemy nexus. How this is achieved is killing 1 or more inhibitors in each lane (one per lane guarded by 3 turrets, only one required to win), which allows for the turrets guarding the Nexus to be attacked and then allows for the Nexus to be destroyed.
There are a lot of other elements to the game. There are buffs (red buff  makes your auto attack deal "true damage" (ignores armor and MR, does the damage that it says), more damage per your level, and slows, blue buff gives you mana and energy regeneration and cool down reduction) that are obtained from killing the neutral monster that holds it, global objectives (killing Dragon gives each person on your team Gold,  killing Baron gives each person on your team more Gold, experience, and a buff), and more.
Each champion also has it's own unique play style and role. For example,  Annie is a burst caster meaning that she can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time but has to wait for cool downs before doing any more damage. And, since her damage is mostly from spells, she itemizes Ability Power to hit higher. Amumu is a tank who has great initiation. Ashe is an AD (attack damage) carry whose damage comes mostly from her auto attack, therefore buying AD makes her hit higher, but also benefits from crit chance, life steal, and attack speed.
In general, the game has many elements and in order to be good at the game you have to understand these elements and use the knowledge to your advantage. It's also tons of fun to play and I would definitely recommend it to anybody and everybody. It's kind of like Nexus Wars, in a way.
*** A+++ would play agian
Another thing to note blueboybob, is that League of Legends is going to be coming out with one of their biggest updates since the game was released as a closed beta, its a whole new game mode with a whole different type of strategy involved.
I had seen previously you asked about the length of games, and even though the traditional map Summoner's Rift (5v5) can take anywhere from 20 minutes (surrender) to 80 minutes (the longest I've ever played) this new game mode averages around 20 minutes of explosively action packed gameplay. This new mode is called Dominion, and I'll post some helpful links in a second. Basically, if you are familiar with Call of Duty games where you play Domination, you capture 5 point on the map with your champion, and the longer you hold these points for, and the more you control, the faster your enemy teams points fall. When your enemy team's points hit 0, you win. This game mode is something revolutionary to the MOBA genre, and you'll basically be around as it sprouts.
yes as a matter of fact, seeing as I went to a private school, I can tell you that their expenses are quite high per student. Our school, despite having a $20,000 a year tuition still needed about $100,000 in donations per year just to stay afloat. The teachers who worked there were either priests, who were not paid but instead given housing and food, or were paid at a rate lower than at public schools. Students had to buy all of their own books and supplies for every class except a few that were subsidized by the state. 
Just do the math: if a teacher teaches 20 students per year, and expects to be paid $40,000 a year, that is 2 grand per student per year for that alone. Then you have the cost of maintenance and upkeep; services such as water and electricity; non teaching employees such as coaches, accountants, lawyers, guidance councilors; Insurance (lots of insurance!); Busing; and if its private, advertising. Thus you have 2 options, either very large schools with very low faculty to student ratios (aka poor quality schools as any study will show you). Or you can hike tuition and say fuck you to those who can't afford it. If your goal is to educate everyone, then this is a horrible option. However i your goal is profit, then this option works and indeed is the only option of the two that works. 
you get what you pay for
'Hardiback' is a fiber cement based building product. Cutting these boards produces respirable crystalline silica. Prolonged breathing of crystalline silica causes Silicosis, which is bad and and kills 1000's every year. The MSDS for hardie products lists this a hazard, but if you use proper PPE (personal protective equipment) you should be good to go. Occasional/incidental exposure typically doesn't have significant long term effects. Its the poor bastards in the mines, masons, etc who are exposed daily to the dust that will have long term problems. (A friend who was a mason for 20 yrs died last year from this; very painful, sad, terrible and 100% preventable disease)
 It could cause Silicosis. I know it sucks and its hot, but wear your DAMN PPE!!
Please edit this to add ages, the length of your relatationship, paragraph line breaks... no more ellipsis, and a  Then post it in r/relationships. 
First off, "buying on margin" means you're gambling with money you don't have.  Borrowing from your broker to increase the size of your stake.  Leverage.  Bad idea when the deal is so heavily stacked against you.
Secondly, as you hint, it really looks like BofA's only hope is a massive bailout.  So you'd be betting AGAINST the "free" market, in favor of a moral hazard.  And if there IS a massive bailout, it would somehow have to preserve the stock price in some sort of managed bankruptcy.
Finally, Buffett is a hypocrite.  He's buying all these PREFERRED shares on very favorable terms.  This puts him at the front of the line when bankruptcy comes... so his purchase actually makes stockholders all that much poorer.  THEN, he turns around and writes op-ed pieces encouraging people to go buy stocks.  Even though they'll be behind him in line, propping up HIS stock.  And what price did Buffett buy at again?  (Were the details ever released?)
  Buy BofA if you want, but don't buy it on margin.
...just like ye olde traditional Christmas celebration, practiced for hundreds of years, with public nudity, drunkenness, cross-dressing, dogs marrying cats; the whole shebang.
And no, I'm not talking about Saturnalia. I'm talking about what people actually did in England to celebrate Christmas, and why those so-called founders of our "Christian Nation" came over here to outlaw Christmas. 
It was secular then, and it was still secular after the Victorians changed it into a gift-giving exchange with Santa in the 19th century. The arrival of the middle class, as well as the arrival of mass production made this inevitable. I wonder sometimes if the frenzied shopping has merely replaced the season of "misrule" that was at the center of the Christmas celebration. 
The real traditional Christmas was misrule, where the "lower classes," the peasantry, were allowed to let off steam by play-acting at swapping places with the nobility and the clergy. It came to a head when densely populated cities like New York saw mass rioting in the streets by gangs of poor youth, and, of course, labor movements. The organizers of the new style of quiet Christmas celebration, such as John Pintard, a city planner, were big-time landowners, capitalists, and basically city leaders who saw value in taking men and boys off the streets and out of the taverns on Christmas, and putting them back into their homes--after they bought what they needed in the shops, of course. The new Victorian sentimentality (and the emergence of the middle class) created something called "childhood" which was rather unknown before. This allowed rich families to transfer their yearly Wassail donations to their own children--the money need not leave the family.
 The religious observance was brought back into Christmas through the efforts of, not the religious right, but the religious left. Far left. 
The Unitarians. 
So next time they blame you for the "War on Christmas," remember that it was religious zealots who started it (think Cromwell), but it was secularists who won.
 The True Meaning of Christmas is drinking, gorging, and fornicating. 
The "point" is that the Christianists who want to have a live Nativity scene are not "practicing their religion." They are practicing a political act of Speech. 
Of course what I said in the hyperlink was a lampoon (kind of assumed that was understood), but if a group that wants to make a Speech statement of basically bullying everyone else into accepting their version of events, other groups should make statements, too. That's the myth of America, right? Equal opportunity?
The real "point" here is what I said in the comment, rather than the one sentence hyperlink comment, which I suppose will be what's read.
TL/DR: If the Christianists wish to make a statement about the true meaning of Christmas, then perhaps secularists should, too.
Oh, I meant the word 'had' as in:
In order to disbelieve in Islam, I had to find something... etc. Not I "had" to find something or else... etc. 
So had meant "in order to" disbelieve in Islam, not only would something have to convince me it wasn't true, but also overcome years of teaching and indoctrination.
I'm going to copy and paste my story from the [/r/exmuslim](/r/exmuslim) thread on [why I left Islam.]( 
I was raised as a good Muslim. I live in the US and went to an Islamic school until the 8th grade. 
Looking back, the first thing that set me on my path was the death of my mother in grade 5. I was completely flabbergasted and previously had no experience of death, certainly this could not happen in a good muslim family. 
Ironically, this made turn towards religion more, but in a weirdly hollow way. I never remember being sincere in any of my daily prayers and I often wouldn't even say anything, but move my lips in pretend. I also memorized much of the Quran. 
Despite my non-sincerity, my beliefs were that of a fundamentalist, creationist, misogynistic muslim. I remember reading a kids book by Harurn Yahya which 'disproves' evolution by comparing evolution to a tornado assembling a 747. I was in 10th grade and believed it hook, line, and sinker. I even asked my 10th grade biology teacher why we were learning evolution when it was so obvious it was false. I remember giving me this sad look and she just said that all the data support it which we'll see later in the semester. 
At that point I had opened up a bit from my extremely sheltered life (never had a sleep over, only went to friends house during eid, never left the house on the weekend except with famliy, never even knew anyone non muslim really, etc) and realized not only how different I was from everyone else, but how much that prevented me from being a normal person. 
Since I was already non-sincere in my belief (I still don't know why, but often times I would get really depressed thinking about hell and promising myself to pray double prayers for the next 5 years to make up for my missed prayers), when I met an atheist for the first time it was a complete shock. I was in the 12th grade and I did not realize that there were atheists in the world. I mean, I knew there were christmas only christians and others who didn't take faith seriously, but wasn't even able to comprehend the notion of atheism at first. 
It was slowly starting to make sense to me and I began asking myself questions: "Am I an atheist?". But I quickly answered 'no', since I did believe in God with my odd not sincere but also sincerely scared of hell belief system. I started reading almost anything I could get my hands on online. Not stuff debunking Islam, but I joined a forum where many people were non-religious (though their main topic was something else, not religion, however it often came up), so I began exposing myself to other views. 
When I started college (though still living with my parents in my sheltered life) a took a course on basic christian theology, basic philosohpy, and a more advanced course on gender and society. 
Bam, so much knowledge dropped on me at once really shifted my views. I didn't renounce Islam, but was shocked at how easy it was to refute Christianity from an academic point (in the sense the the early sources are complete shit compared to the story of the Quran's compilation). The information I received in the gender course pushed me firmly away from misogyny and into the feminist camp. I still considered myself a Muslim.
My second year at University, I took a course on Jerusalem and the three Abrahamic faiths. Again, I was surprised at how easy it was to trace the evolution of Judaism in response to major events. I asked my professor point blank: "If we can so easily see that these religions change significantly over time in reaction to human events, why still believe the religions are true?" He said that just because they change doens't me there still ins't truth in them. 
I was disappointed when I found out we would not be doing any similar exegesis on the Quran (as it barely exists academically). So using what I learned from Judaic and Christian exegesis, I compared the story of the compilation of the Quran to the compilation of the Torah and the Gospel. While the official version of the story according to Muslims was better than the Judeo-Christian accounts, I could still see the same problems: lack of original source material, distance between writers and events, etc. But was really cinched it for me was the rescission of Uthman. I had read enough Orwell to know what that meant despite Muslim's best attempts to spin it. 
And that was that, I could no longer believe Islam (its atrocious record on gender issues didn't help either). This was further solidified by taking a course on the history of early Islam, especially the Shia/Sunni split and the events leading up to that. It became clear that what we call Islam today is simply the winning political party throughout history. 
*** I thought you came to read my story? :P
I dont know exactly what I am :( I am opposed to giving myself a denomination other than christian, but I would like to know under what field of study I fall under and from which church I would be best off furthering my education. I know I'm not Catholic , and I  have  a hard time accepting a church that bases their teachings off of a non biblical character, IE, Joseph Smith, Martin Luther- although I have tons and tons of respect for him. I also don't like the idea of saints because I don't like humans saying with any certainty that so and so was more righteous than the rest or that so and so is surely in heaven. I went to a Messianic Synagogue as a kid and highly approved of them, but I hear the movement lacks unity and that some congregations can be downright hateful so I think I'm done with the "messianic"  title.  
TL:DR: Was Messianic Jew in my parent's house, Now Non denominational Christian. 
I have been reading the book Rendezvous with Rama, so I have been puzzling over this a bit recently. This is how I have come to understand it:
Centrifugal force describes the repulsion as a force that acts on spinning things pushing them away.
Centripetal force describes the opposite force, the force pushing against a moving object forcing it to travel in a curved path.
Imagine you were spinning inside a gravitron carnival ride. If the carnival ride abruptly stopped existing, you would fly off in a strait line.
Because moving in a curve is less efficient than moving in a line, you must constantly accelerate to maintain the same speed. This acceleration is what simulates gravity.
Imagine you were inside a spinning cylinder that was filled with a vacuum. You could lazily float all day and the cylinder could spin as fast as it wanted, but it would not push you at all. No centrifugal force.
However, if the spinning cylinder had an atmosphere, the gas will (very slowly?) communicate some of the motion of the cylinder to you, so eventually you will start moving.
Once you start moving, physics wants you to move in a strait line. However, there is only so far a strait line can go inside a circle. Eventually you will "fall" to the edge of the cylinder. But, that is just you going in a strait line.
Centripetal force occurs when you reach the interior surface of the cylinder. When you walk on the surface of the cylinder, centripetal force is the force of the cylinder pushing up at you preventing you from escaping.
tl;dr
It's not the cylinder that is causing the force, its the stuff inside the cylinder trying to go strait. The cylinder is just blocking it.
edit: understood it better 30 seconds after posting, edited to that effect
I read your post and I don't understand how I have it backwards. I think you said it more clearly, but we are saying the same thing.
"The wall of the ride is PUSHING YOU AWAY from your straight line path"
is pretty much saying what I was trying to say with
"Centripetal force describes the opposite force, the force pushing against a moving object forcing it to travel in a curved path."
The other point I made about the atmosphere in the cylinder kind of a separate issue, but I think I am correct about that too. Look at it this way:
Imagine you are in a big rotating cylinder that had an atmosphere. Like, a really big one (like the space station from the book Rendezvous with Rama.)
If you took a rocket car and drove fast enough to cancel the cylinders rotation, say 35 mph, you would be completely still.
However, it would not seem that way. You would need to keep your foot on the gas because friction from the atmosphere would keep slowing you down.
If you then jumped, that same atmosphere would push you back. Maybe the wind would be strong enough to push you back down, maybe not, but it **would** be pushing you at least a little.
Its possible you might be able to float for a while right in the center, but with random turbulence i doubt it would be stable.
tl;dr
The ice cube actually does move, it just takes a while. (hence why I said "very slowly")

Edit: I just noticed you said, "and it then started spinning". 
I was thinking of a cylinder filled with air that had been spinning for a long time, so that the air inside the space had time to couple with the rotation of the cylinder.



Would you recommend that approach?
I'm thinking about aiming for that, since if it get I can just divide the chapters and accidentally a book anyways.
I think you're in a unique position to market to a large audience (fittit) and not get labeled as some sort of whore. They (me too) would genuinely want to read what you have to write. 

I speak from (somewhat) similar experience - r/sandiego digs my cooking. We meet up a lot, I frequently bring food, and many asked that I give a cooking class. Our community has a few thousand folks that I can reach and though I can only give 2 classes a month due to time constraints, I sell out 20 spots for $40 a pop in under 15 minutes every time I hold a class, just by reaching out to reddit. I love doing it, they seem to genuinely love coming to class.
 I'm sure your ebook would be a smashing success.
(mega simile) Colleges are much like birthday cakes; you have 'icing'-that is to say, attractive things (EMPAC, ECAV, Biotech, supercomputers) that make the school look good to prospective students, investors, and alumni; you also have the 'cake,' which is the campus infrastructure and programs that are used from day to day.  (The candles, presumably, are the decorations deployed at special occasions.)
While SAJ has done a lot to change the makeup of the Institute's metaphorical birthday cake, most of that change has been limited to the icing.  We now have EMPAC, ECAV, and Biotech, but the 'cake' still consists of a dozen decrepit, decades-old buildings.  None of the Ricketts-era buildings have been renovated from top to bottom since she arrived, and four of them lack elevators (and the Ricketts freight lift was rejected from use in the Tower of Terror for being too creepy).  The DCC continues to be just shabby and awful.  And let's not even discuss E-Complex, which looks like a crappy monastery on the inside and a flophouse on the outside.
Long story short, the icing is pretty, but the cake is not just stale--it's nonexistent!  We're now stuck with the unhappy condition of a [cake consisting entirely of iced Styrofoam forms](
TL; DR: Dr. Jackson, you have the icing, but you have no cake.  **Where is the cake?**

(cue the Portal jokes)
Since there's a lot of the negative, I'll talk about the positive.  For anyone who's interested in a description of Rensselaer's transformation under Dr. Jackson, I highly recommend the recent publication * Renaissance at Rensselaer: A President, A Plan, A University Transformed*.  Although this book contains quite a few "fluffy" sections that appear to be meant for PR as opposed to information, it is extremely informative about Dr. Jackson's tenure, particularly the creation and early implementation of the Rensselaer Plan.
When Dr. Jackson came in to RPI in the late 90s, the school was in need of some serious transformation.  Obviously I wasn't around at the time, but almost all reports say that we'd stagnated, that we were losing our name.  The Board didn't hire Dr. Jackson because she was going to take the slow, cautious way out of this rut; they hired her because she was a strong leader and a risk-taker.  As Ms. Gregg mentioned in her editorial, Dr. Jackson is a strong, demanding, and exacting leader - this allows her to unite a group very immediately around a vision and make rapid, significant change.  
*[The Rensselaer Plan]( creation process was a collaborative one - from what we could find, it involved seeking extensive input from all constituencies around five main questions (quoted from the book):
1. What defines the intellectual core in key disciplines at Rensselaer?  Is it important, and why?  True excellence requires such definition and examination.
2. In these disciplines, are we in a leadership position?  Do we set the standard and the agenda?  These areas will serve as our foundation.
3. If we are not in a leadership position, do we have the underlying strengths and capabilities necessary to move rapidly into a position of primacy with the proper focus and investment?  We will build on these areas of strength.
4. Are there areas that are so vital that we must create a presence in order to stand in the community of world-class universities?  We will stake out an identity in these critical disciplines.
5. What areas of current endeavor must we be willing to transform--or to give up--in order to focus our resources and our energies to create the impact we envision?  We will make the difficult decisions that are required by a fundamental commitment to our highest ideals.

I agree wholeheartedly with the goal of the Plan, namely to to achieve prominence in the 21st century as a top-tier world-class technological research university, with global reach and global impact.  I've written quite a few Top Hat articles to this effect - education should be about growing leaders who will have an impact on the world, not just training engineers.  
This will probably be the most controversial of the statements in this post, but I even support the vision behind many of the programs that have been enacted under this plan, such as the CLASS Initiative and EMPAC.  (I'd argue that the issues with these two programs are issues with implementation as opposed to vision, and as implementation can be improved, I'm still optimistic for their future.)
That said, Dr. Jackson has a very specific (although expansive) skill set and personality that has brought us this far.  The past shows us this clearly, and I think it's important to look at and remember.  However, while we keep an eye on the past, I think it's the future that's important and should guide our decisions as we progress.
**EDIT: *- There is no good or bad (except in intentions); what's important is fit to the current situation.  Dr. Jackson's an amazing visionary leader who has done some amazing visionary things, but we should think about what qualities we need now and in the future.
This is the first thing i've read in a while that I can actually partially agree with...  Not only is the problem Peak Oil, but resources in general.  Now as I see it, this "peak oil" you mention is nothing but a spark applied to a fuse which leads to a huge powder keg waiting to blow.  Eventually, Yes, Oil will become more scarce, Just like any other non-replenishable commodity.  What many people don't realize, is that the world in general, is extremely dependent on oil and oil based compounds.  Most of your plastics used in cars, drinking cups, water bottles, etc, all come from oil.  All of the computer cases, computer components, and half the chemicals that go into most modern tech, are oil based.  How about the pharmaceutics industry?  Yep, Those lovely medicines that help "protect" us, oil based compounds many of them.  Now lets take it one step further... The food we eat... Well, since the invention of the gas/diesel powered tractor, it has allowed abundant food for everyone to eat at "reasonable" prices....  what about heat during the winter?  Well before natural gas, or oil heat, we had coal, or fireplaces which warmed the house.  The problem is, the same companies who have hit what i'd like to consider their "mid-life crisis" and realize that they may not be able to survive if the price of oil triples, in cost over the next 10 years, they are jumping onto the bandwagon I like to call the "Green Scare". they push the efficiency numbers, and they push legislation requiring the BAN of incandescent lights from being purchased after this december, requiring consumers to pay more money, for CFL or LED bulbs, when their old bulbs that have been around since the 1800's finally flicker their last light.  What these companies are doing, is they are realzing that they can leverage the "Green Movement" against the people.  They are also making it harder for industry to stay in america too and I think that it is intentional!  Now lets see....  all of our INDUSTRIAL companies, have moved to India, or China where regulations are more lax.  Over the  past 10 years, more laws / bills have been passed making it harder for the average company to establish themselves in the US if they generate "hazardous waste".  What is hazardous waste you may ask?  Well, pretty much any waste that wont compost.  so your plastic byproducts, metals, acids, bases, it's all "outlawed" or should I say "outpriced".  In order to start a mechanics shop here in the US. you need to have a dozen or so licenses to operate and handle oil, gas, have constant soil samples taken (at your expense), god forbid you drip a little oil by mistake, there are huge fines.  Oh, and the property you invested in for your shop, good luck ever selling it, because once it's marked as a location that hazardous waste once was, the government can pretty much devalue it to nothing with "administrative cleanup costs" for the potential buyer.  Now who would want all these tight regulations?  Surely not big corporations, right? WRONG.  Big Corporations love to have strict rules that *they* can abide to, even though it might cost them some money, because it keeps competition out.  It's right up there with Recalls... If the cost of doing a recall is more expensive than the cost to settle a few lawsuits, Don't do the recall...
Now i'm not saying environmental protection is a bad thing, in fact it's a very very good thing, but when you charge people thousands of dollars every year, to be "handlers" of 'hazardous' waste, it keeps small business out of the picture.  All the big manufacturers have plants already established overseas, where they don't have to worry about the US laws as much.  this helps protect them from rising competition, and yet ensures they can "scare" everyone into buying their products as they push bills to require the use of their products as a replacement.
The Days of "Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak" in their garage building a computer from scratch and making it big, competing with IBM.... If they were to try to start "Apple Computer Inc." TODAY... they woudl be hit with so many lawsuits over "improper handling of hazardous materials" and a million other things, they would be shut down overnight.  Hell, half the chemicals you need to create "new" compounds like they did back in the 1800's are now unobtainable by the general public, for "public safety"...  American Innovation is Dying, because corporate greed.  they don't want competition...  You know, there are several anti-trust laws, however they skirt around all of them, by just keeping the competition out... go figure.  Just look at MaBell...  Wait, that was broken up, but alas... how many cell providers are there *now*... lets see... Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon... Three... Sure, you could argue "virgin mobile" but that's really a "baby bell" once again...  we are going back to a country filled with corporations that monopolize.
Now, Where do I see this leading us?  I don't think OIL is really our biggest worry, as much as WATER is... or even CORN....  Did you know that most of the food you eat here in the US has CORN as a filler? Yes, that Angus Beef burger you buy at Burger King... is mostly BREAD... because it's cheaper to add lets say %20 or %30 cornmeal into the chopped meat, to "spread it out" to make it more profitable... and what about soda?  Well, Corn Syrup is cheaper than Cane Sugar... In fact, the government subsidizes corn growers!  There is corn products in almost everything you eat and drink.  Except Water....  Now Water...  Most of this world is Salt or Brackish water, and it is not drinkable.  To make matters worse, we *are* polluting our waterways, especially in places like India, and China, and even though it's on the other side of the world, anyone should realize, that this pollution does affect the whole world... not just locally... it just takes *time*.  How soon until we no longer can drink tap water because it's so polluted that we need to rely on bottled water that is selling for 3.65 a gallon just like Gas?  I say sooner than later.
Don't forget...  if a company isn't turning a profit, all they need to do, is increase prices, cut back quantity, and blame Oil prices.
  Our country is filled with companies who only care about themselves and will do anything to silence american entrepreneurship.  They also will do anything they can to be sure to make a profit, even if it means scaring the masses into buying their products by pushing bills to outlaw products made by competitors by bringing up environmental "concerns".
The heart of war is land.  The net is a landscape composed of data.  The net was free, at one time.  We were citizens of a frontier, a free land.
Physically, you are already owned.  Corporations own you.  They own me.  They determine what you eat, what you drink, what kind of air you breathe, how long you will live.
The free exchange of information between the cattle is causing unrest.  Restless cattle are detrimental to profit margins.  Therefore, the free exchange of information between cattle shall be halted.
tldr- Enjoy it while you can.  Information distribution systems have a history of causing widespread enlightenment and unrest, until those systems are subjugated.     
Well I think there is a difference between people attacking the government and its policies and people who just lump in AmeriKKKA as if it was one homogeneous unit.  I completely agree that all government policies and actions should be and NEED to be held to account to our moral standards but it annoys me when I keep on getting lumped in with my government when they do crazy shit.  
Also on a separate note sometimes it gets annoying when people attack the united states and act the world would of been such a nicer place if it never existed.  Don't get me wrong we have done so many things it would take years to go through and explain them all but at the same time as a powerful nation with lots of choices to make we are going to get some of them wrong, and that doesn't mean that overall we haven't been a gigantic positive influence for the world between our military stability, trade, and technology.
edit: TLDR I think we both agree that its okay to attack governments but not so much the people.

&gt;reddit is about ~20 years old on average (well, those who post comments, anyway). i don't blame them for it, but the paranoia and 'doom n gloom' feeling that nearly every generation fears rarely comes to fruition in the terms these people envision.
&gt;further more, i can't really imagine what it's like to grow up in the post 9/11 era. lots of redditors don't know of a world without 'terrorism' being at the tip of everyone's tongues. add to it the most perplexing and outlandish conservative media that has ever existed plus a little 'no one from either party has our interests at heart', and you've got the makings for 'creepy survivalist website' musings to pop up everywhere in various threads.
&gt;i'm sure i will be downvoted to oblivion for this one, but kids: things can get better, and they usually do. our world is the safest place it has ever been in the history of mankind, statistically speaking. our media wouldn't have you believe that we can patch up our foreign relations or energy dilemmas, but the solutions are out there. is America being douchey and treating its citizens poorly? sure.. that doesn't make this 'the end times.' world wars and segregation and even communism seemes to be 'it' for a lot of people. then they grew up and got some perspective.
&gt; don't lose your shit just because other people and our abhorrent media would like you to. take a step back and assess things on your own terms, using the world's media and resources as a means to inform yourself.

My response:
I want to upvote you for being reasonable, but unfortunately you're like the other extreme of the reddit spectrum that I find equally biased and unrealistic.
&gt;Our world is the safest place it has ever been in the history of mankind, 
Possibly if you only consider the present moment, but considering how unsustainable most of the processes that modern technology depends on are, I wouldn't say it's necessarily accurate to extrapolate future trends based on present ones.
&gt;statistically speaking. our media wouldn't have you believe that we can patch up our foreign relations or energy dilemmas, but the solutions are out there.
If you consider climate change one of our 'energy dilemmas' then no, I'm sorry, no solution is out there. In fact, the window for us to provide a solution seems to be getting [smaller and smaller.]( 
So yeah, I'm glad you're being realistic, but come on...let's be realistic. We as a species face some tremendous hurdles in the near future (relatively speaking). Unfortunately the main hurdles we face also seem to be the ones most people would like to ignore.
Hangon one sec, yes, the United States is an enormous importer, and we have large amounts of debt, but the end of your statement, that the collapse of the dollar as reserve currency doesn't mean the end of the world for us.
Even Tim Geithner has said (before he sort of had to recant) that he'd be open to a replacement of the dollar as reserve system.  Yes, other countries have to buy U.S. treasuries to participate in the world economy, but what has happened is the dollar has been stretched beyond what it was ever intended to do.  Our exports are hurt because the dollar is buoyed by so much foreign investment, and we have lost policy autonomy because so much of the world economy is based on ours.  If we were to cut back debt issuance and tighten the supply of dollars, the world economy would grind to a halt.  
The U.S. would be better off with higher interest payments on new debt and a lower demand for debt if it was able to manage it's dollar with an eye towards the U.S. economy, and not the entire worlds.  
The idea of anyone letting us wipe out our debt is way off base, but we can get to a point where the demand for our debt reaches a reasonable level.  If our dollar weakens, our exports become more attractive and we can close our trade imbalance.  Sure, a weak dollar sounds like a disaster, especially if you want to go to Europe, but it might be what we need to repair our massive trade imbalance, and resume actually making things in this country.
The end of the dollar as reserve currency might actually be of great benefit to the United States
If by, "It could be argued" you mean, "It is a total certainty", then I completely agree.
People act like George Bush and Dick Cheney elected themselves.
I know the system is fucked, but it only takes moderate intelligence and a dash of skepticism to *realize* that it is fucked.
tl;dr
The Government is bad because our populace is stupid. *Not* the other way around.

There are many players to learn from if you're new, but how many of them stream? I can't tell. I myself wouldn't say I'm too bad at this game. I have alot of experience in these games and knows more or less what to do and what not to. But watching my stream to learn as a newbie wouldn't probably be the best considering i usualy do moves that i KNOW aint good, but i do them anyway because i cba to sit in base and just wait, or because i more or less find the most fun in Dota2 when the adrenaline starts pumping. Im more of a player that finds the spots to enter the fight but have no idea where the exit is nor the outcome. I usualy take fights where the odds aint to our favour, just beacuse if i win the fight or survive long enough i get that good feeling. 
I make bad moves that i know are bad, beacuse the adrenaline is my drug.
I got 7years~ of experience in these kind of games, do as you like ; www.twitch.tv/bennetoft
I wish I could ride, even a cruiser. Unfortunatley I'm poor, and a college student working 2 jobs, so that ride home that I mentioned is all I needed to forget about everything! 
I know what's it like.
We can assume that, with a 0 mph frame of reference for Solipsze, that the flash frost will be traveling at 220mph. That's a rate of 3.67 miles per minute, or 0.27 minutes per mile.

Sorry, you still aren't saying what should be done.  In fact, you didn't bother to address even a single one of my arguments.
&gt; They didn't need tent towns to achieve their success and neither do you. 
Actually, tent towns have appeared numerous times before in America's past, and yes, even for political reasons.
But let's ignore that.  The fact is that straight-up protesting simply doesn't work any more - because the very news of that protesting is suppressed.
Consider that the demonstrations against the Iraq War were the largest _in the history of the planet_ - and what happened?  It barely made the evening news!  It certainly didn't spark any public debate.
Consider that there were repeated and huge demonstrations against the Wall Street criminals before Occupy Wall Street - they _didn't even_ make the evening news.
Compare and contrast with the effects of Occupy Wall Street - which has excited comments and approval from politicos of both sides and a huge amount of media coverage.
What you are saying is that we should abandon the one tactic that has been found to have some effectiveness, and go back to the tactics that have been completely useless for a decade and more.
&gt; But what you don't do is impede on the rights of others to achieve those goals.
Every strike, every sit-down occupation, even a regular demonstration impedes the rights of others.
And as I mentioned to you before, it's really hard to think of a place to occupy that impinges on fewer people's "rights" than Zuccotti Park.
tl; dr:  You:  go back to the thing you were doing before that didn't work.  Us:  no.
It's been a non-issue. Back in Australia, I never faced any harassment from other Anglo-Aussies over my conversion (which was kinda weird because we are a pretty xenophobic bunch). The only "harassment" I faced was from Arabs when I'd go to Friday prayers. They'd sometimes say that they didn't want non-Arabs to pray in the same building or stuff like that. Still, other non-Arab Muslims would face the same discrimination from Arabs too, so it wasn't about converting.
Here in Malaysia, its really been a non-issue. Sure, my wife and I get "looks" all the time (esp. if we go to Alor Star or anywhere else where they don't get too many *mat salleh's*). Most of the time the looks are just curiousness; not really condescending. I can only think of two occasions where we've had some negativity. Once was from an elderly woman in a shopping centre a couple of weeks after we arrived in Penang. She was following up around Jusco and give us both dirty looks before walking up to my wife and telling her that it was sinful to be flirting with a mat salleh. She obviously had no idea that we were married.
The other incident - we live just opposite USM where they get a lot of Salafi Arab students. We used to have breakfast in a Nasi Kandar store just opposite the University and we'd always be getting dirty looks from the Arabs. I managed to make friends with a Pakistani baker at one of the shops who is also friendly with most of the Arab students. Apparently my wife and I had been all the talk with the Arabs for a couple of years, stuff about "how immoral Malaysians are for allowing their Muslim women and kuffar mat salleh's to be together". Mr Pakistani apparently took great delight is telling them all that I was a Muslim and that they had nothing to worry about.
**TL; DR version.**
From Malaysians, no harassment.
I think what pisses people off is how you guys make an adviceanimal like this and pat yourselves on the back about something that should be a selfless act. There are worse ways to get attention and affirmation though, that's for sure.
Charity: you're doing it wrong.
Sir, I would like to say that there are many other atheist charities and secular charities alongside the many good religious organizations.  It does nothing to bash people when they give to (smart) charities.  Also everyone likes a pat on the back for their good deeds and feel pride in something they (collectively) accomplished.
  r/atheism has a golden dick and is circlejerking DWB into the bank, and that's just OK.
My freshman year of college I had a roommate who liked to jerk off a lot.  I would always come back to the room and he would fling a blanket over himself and slam his laptop shut. I learned pretty quickly to intentionally fumble with my keys as I made my way back into the room to give him notice of my intent to interrupt his masturbation time.
One fine Sunday I was laying in bed watching TV when I notice my roommate get up and leave. About 10 minutes went by when I started to get hungry as I hadn't eaten anything yet. Now, due to the location of my room, the lounge of that floor of the dorm was clearly visible. In fact from my side of the room you can see directly into the big bay windows of the lounge. So when I stood up that fateful day I made the mistake of glancing into the lounge where before my very eyes I saw my roommate laying down behind a couch in the lounge pressed up against the glass of the window with his dick out, fapping without a care in the world.
    
Now, I had caught him jerking it many times before, but this was the first time I ever made eye contact with his dick. I quickly lost my appetite and decided to just get out of the building and go for a walk. I was gone for about an hour and on my way back I hatched my scheme. When I walked back into the room he was there. I knew he hadn't seen me before so I began my rehearsed dialog: "Dude, you will never guess what I saw! While you were out I stood up and saw someone laying in the lounge jerking off!" he then turned around with his face bright red and said "what?" so I said "I didn't see his face, but he had the tiniest dick I have ever seen!! Can you imagine what kind of sick fuck it takes to do something like that?!" He was utterly speechless from then on out. 
    
For the rest of the short time that I lived with him I made sure to tell the story anytime any of my friends were in the room, even though they had already heard the story and knew that my roommate was the perpetrator. I got to enjoy the shame in his face every time.
Make sure you reinforce your spank tent from both sides.
There *is* a card catalog buried deep in the recesses of the library, but it has signs all over it saying that it hasn't been updated since 1989.  I've only ever seen one particular man who must be about 70 wander over to the drawers and try to use it.  More power to him, I suppose.
 I used an online catalog.  

IMO this debacle was because of: poor coaching, lack of preparation, and no trust.
They did a great job getting down the field but with the clock running with near 20 seconds why would you not call one of your 2 timeouts and take one shot at the end zone. I understand your point about the sack but an NFL team should have at least a handful of plays for this type of situation. If you watched the final packers drive thats what I am talking about. The Packers had specific route adjustments where if the ball is caught they are near or breaking towards the sideline. If the WRs are covered then all Romo has to do is throw it out of bounds. I dont know if the Boys just dont have this in the playbook or what...
As we have seen throughout this season Garrett does not have confidence in Romo late in games. He would rather have a rookie kicker try a 50-yarder to win the game.
The only thing that pisses me off is WHY DID THEY NOT CALL A TIME OUT, instead of spiking the football. The team didnt seem to be in any rush at all and ran off almost 10 seconds. Dumb play by Romo, Garrett, and everyone else who can make that decision.
As for the time out on the kicker, if they thought it was going to be delay of game then you have to make that call. If not the kicker is moved back even further and that would have been terrible. 
I am not mad about the time out but if they called it early on you could take one shot at the endzone and then spike it or call you last time out if they didnt get in.
should have called timeout instead of spiking, everything else is just unfortunate.
I have seen much (and I really mean MUCH) fuckin worse on the BART. I wont even type it out because it would cause me to fully recall probably some of the grossest shit I have ever seen in my life. And I have seen some fucked up shit... but this... this needs to remain kept pushed down into the darkest place I can find in my mind.
 I just stand when I take the BART. 
You see, I don't see what has really changed though. After Stella he was sad definitely, and even got a little pathetic, but obviously understandably. I think Ted's pursuit of being a good teacher is wonderful and show's that he really isn't shallow. He's also well on his way to achieving his architectural dream. Ted's story has really taken a back seat to Robin, Barney, Lilli, and Marshall this season, all 4 of whom are going through major changes. During this time Teddy Westside has been a great friend (who could argue after last night?). So he's afraid of the changes in his group of friends, I don't think that makes him a bitch at all, I think that makes him normal. I mean, your two best friends in the world are starting a family, that will absolutely change your relationship with them.
The other thing that can be frustrating is when people hold Ted to different standards than other characters; because he is arguably the most dynamic character on the show (the show is after all based around the events of his life which allowed him to meet the mother of his children; Ted himself insists that the story of becoming the man he had to become in order to be the right man for their mother is important if not more important than the story of how they logistically meet). Because he changes so much, we expect more out of him. Established personalities get away with the flaws that we would complain about on Ted because we expect less of them, e.g. Ted is shallow for sleeping around and hooking up with people, but that's just what Barney does.
Now obviously the situation is more complicated than that, but you see what I'm getting at. I'm glad to see all 5 characters truly evolving now, as we've gotten more into Barney's and Robin's pasts.
The only thing that **does** piss me off about him is his complacency; his belief that his woman will magically come upon him and everything will be perfect.
** I honestly haven't noticed these serious changes in Ted's personality since the first few seasons. Definitely point me to some specifics and I may see it another way**


I agree with you to an extent about Ted not really changing, but I find this to be a bad thing. He is slightly changing, as any character should and we are even told at the beginning of the series that he had to change in order to be the man his wife would marry. However, the only way I can see him changing is that he keeps becoming more and more of a weak personality who continues to leech off of his friends. I honestly cannot see him being "worthy" of any real woman at this point as he treats every woman he meets as either "the one" or finds something wrong with them.
I also have issues with his supposed moral code. Ted is suppose to be the hero of the story but he continues to do things that are on the same moral level as Barney. He cheats on Victoria in season one and then in the current season he hits on and then eventually kisses her despite knowing that she has a boyfriend who she is in love with. 
All in all Ted has never been my favorite character but I really cannot give you a real concrete example other then the fact that we are suppose to root for him and I simply cannot bring myself to do that.
** Ted is annoying little girl who is only getting worse as the show progresses.**
(purely opinion)
I really respect and would like to reciprocate the qualification that this is all only opinion!
I see your point about the cheating, my take on that is that Ted's heart, though fickle at times, is the commanding force behind all of his decisions. When he cheated on Victoria with Robin, it was because he truly thought Robin was the one and the girl of his dreams. When it comes to such huge potentials and moments of passion, Ted doesn't hold back, which you could see as childish or brave. Maybe childishly-brave, or bravely-childish.
I mean, you could look at that event one of two ways:
1) Ted wants to get laid, Robin is hot and into him. He tries to get some and gets caught by his long-distance lover.
2) Ted, in a moment of passion and regret for starting a long distance relationship which he knew from the start was a child of his and Victoria's emotional weakness and denial, does not want to miss the opportunity to finally be with an amazing girl who he fully believes could be the only woman for him (in that moment).
I find scenario 2 much more likely, but no matter which way you look at it, Ted was being a jerk, **BUT** he admits it! and tries to make it better.
This was in season 1, however I think the moment with Victoria in this season could be seen in a similar way:
Ted bears the guilt of that night all the way to Season 7, and when given a chance at redemption, he is jubilant and jumps on it. When he begins to realize that that whole guilt complex was very different than how he thought it had been, he is confused. This furthers his sense of wonder in what could have been. He is also jealous frustrated, seeing yet another character from his past happily married and in just the situation he dreams for. In this melting pot of confusion his passions consume him and he kisses Victoria, Victoria's confusion mirroring his own. But in that moment both of them get answers; Victoria realizes that she is exactly where she is meant to be, and Ted gets closure on another one of his failed relationship, and (in a strange way) some hope that he has not missed his chance.
** Ted's heart gets the best of him, but many of his decisions have more than one side to them and can almost always be traced back to genuine love, passion, and healthy emotion**
(purely opinion that is better than yours)
(JK I WOULD NEVER TROLL fellow intelligent fans)
(YOU SIR ARE A GENTLEMAN AND A SCHOLAR)
Just a side note: I loved Victoria.
 Victoria was epic.
I'll try to come up with some specifics that show early on Ted rocking out more than current Ted:
In season 1, Ted skipped the date with his perfect match because he thought Robin was something special, he had strong interests in her and her personality. She matched his checklist perfectly (the loving dogs, quoting Ghostbusters thing, etc.) although he had to work insanely hard to win her over. 
With season 3 being the turning point of his awesomeness in my argument, recently, Ted had 2 incidents where he skipped over a chance at his perfect girl. He was comparing two, which he wanted to go out with, and was going to sacrifice one who seemed almost flawless for him for a girl who had nothing in common with him purely because she reached for the check. The other one I can think of is back in season 5, where Barney had the phone that girls called non-stop because he held his number up at the Super Bowl. In their last ditch effort to find Ted a wife, Marshall and Lily found a girl that was a great fit for a lot of what Ted was looking for, but the phone forced him to follow Barney's footsteps into avoiding a girl if a hotter one is out there.
** Ted used to consider personality in his search for the mother, but (I am agreeing that Stella messed him up) seems to have lost the values he once seemed to find important.**
I don't think this specifically pertains to DAI, but the only way to combat this is to make personal connections with the professors. Email them now, and let them know you're planning on crashing. Prepare a portfolio, come to class with it, your DARS report and contract and let them know that you plan to remain in the classroom even after they finish adding people. Professors can add past the deadline, so as long as you make it clear you're not leaving, do the work, and show an absolute willingness to stick it out in a motivated manner, the success rate is really really high.
 don't give up, people do that pretty easily, so most likely, you'll be fine
We all, to some degree, have to think the people around us are idiots. We don't know what causes them to make the decisions they make. The easiest example is in traffic. You wonder "what the fuck is that idiot doing?" and since you can't possibly know, you attribute it to stupidity. Even if it is a stupid action, we tend to assume that that person does it ALL THE TIME, even when that's likely the first and last time we've ever seen that person.
Many of my friends tell me things like "you're the smartest person I know" and so on. It's not  just flattery, they honestly THINK that. But who's to say that I don't just prefer the company of people who consider me to be smart? Thinking I'm smart has value to me. I'm not proud of that at all, but that is apparently how my brain works.
I know for certain that I feel inadequate around people who are clearly smarter and better organized than I am. I tend to make up some reason why I don't like that person that lets me believe that it's not just jealousy. And I have the horrible habit of trying to impress people with knowledge. I try to counter it by being humble, but it really bothers me that this part of me is so concerned with impressing people.
 I think I'm smart, but I recognize that I'm biased. I don't really want to be a person who goes around thinking I'm smart, or trying to impress people, that seems like a terrible character flaw.
In a way I feel, less now than when I was younger, that I am smarter than most of the people around me.
I wouldn't say I was the smartest, mainly because I had an older brother who would counter anything new I learned with a quick "Oh yeah, I learned that when I was your age".
But this isn't a feeling of superiority.
I feel like I have the answers to a lot of situations because I tend to ignore variables that other people are taking into consideration.
A recent example, talking about animal testing with some friends.
We were all against it and preferred if they tested on humans instead. And I was the first to offer up the notion of volunteering on death row/life-sentence-without-parole inmates. The obvious objection and reason it doesn't happen now is the issue of ethics - but I feel that it's a moot point when it comes to someone who is scheduled to die or is never getting out of prison.
 Yes, because I ignore some issues and tend to see things in black and white.
I would not say I am smarter than the average bear. I do seem more smarter than most at my work  because I live by the rule that you do not assume anything. 
The type of issues I resolve require troubleshooting from start to finish. A lot of people I work with tend to skip over or assume that the easy stuff is as intended.
Always ask if the PC is plugged in and switched on.
Being bold and not using a throwaway! I feel like I'm smarter than most of my friends in certain areas. This doesn't mean I'm some genius and all my friends are idiots (Read: Good Will Hunting). I make mistakes, sometimes dumb mistakes, mostly in video games. I don't have amazing grades (senior year at a university) because I honestly don't care about a lot of my classes. I'd say that as far as "personal decision making" I'm on top compared to a lot of my friends. Many of them are either living 100% of their parents dime, going into junior/senior years of college with no declared major. I'm 21 years old and I have my shit together. I feel like some of my friends are heading down a path where they can't be as successful as I am. Some friends are on the same track as me.
I find that that the big distinction is between the people who care and the people who don't care. I care about the important stuff, even if I don't like it. I take the initiative to figure out stuff that isn't working correctly, whereas some of my friends just say "screw it" and give up.
On the other hand, a lot of my friends think I'm retarded. I don't always make the best on-the-fly decisions in fast paced video games like League of Legends. But boy, if they ever need advice on some sort of a technical issue they're having, I'm their best friend.
**I'm "smarter" because I have my life together and do the important stuff I need to do. Most of my friends don't and think I'm retarded because I do stupid stuff in video games**
I am told I am smart. I'm still in high school though, so I guess I just have potential or something.
But I tend to trust people know more than me most of the time. Up until they say something that shows they have no clue what they're doing.
As far as one of the smartest people among my peers, that's what I am told. Other people ask my opinion when they have no idea what they are doing. It sounds really arrogant to say I think I am smarter than them though.
But I would say that others are more deserving and try harder. I am good at learning things quickly, understanding their interplay, and then recalling them for a test or discussion. Everyone else I consider more deserving, since many work a lot harder than me. They may not learn as quickly, but they spend more time trying to learn it.
I respect their effort, and it probably matters more in the end. But I'm glad I'm smart and can piss away my time and still exceed.
(And just so I don't feel like a total unsubstantiated prick, here are the normal high-school dick measuring standards:
-National Merit Qualifier (top 50,000 kids who took PSAT)
-1490 on my SAT's (1600 scale, Math &amp; Reading, since the 2400 scale tends to confuse people who were on the 1600.)
-Taking, or took, AP: Physics, US History, Chemistry, English, Calculus AB/BC, Economics, and Psychology.
-I never study, go to parties, and have crippling senioritis. Homework grades are killing me.)
 I would consider myself one of the most naturally smart among my peers. But many work harder and I tend to trust someone is smarter than me until they show me they don't know what they are doing. Sorry if it sounds arrogant, but that happens whenever you ask someone if they are smarter than people around them.
‎"Marriage, historically, for all human history, has been between a man and a woman," says Michele Bachmann.
So why are you running for president? Because historically, presidency has been for men only. Just saying. Follows your logic.
Oh, you object because your holy book says it's bad? Well, the same guy that condemns gays in your holy book also says you're not supposed to be exercising authority over men. And since all sin is supposedly equal in the eyes of your god, every time you give an order as president that results in a man doing something, as far as your god is concerned, you're committing sodomy.
 "That's how it's always been done" is, by itself, not a valid reason for anything. Also, according to Michele's holy book, her god disapproves of women presidents as much as he disapproves of the gay people she wants to oppress.
Also, I disapprove of the mother's conduct if she coached her kid into doing that. Children are *not* ideological weapons.
&gt; "Bachman has used kids as pawns in this game the whole time." is a tu quoque fallacy. It's not alright when Bachmann does it, and it's not alright when this mother did it. 
Except, the mother didn't do it.  The mother just finished the communication circle.  Bachman said this to the kid through her public persona, and she brought the kid to Bachman to see who she's saying it too.  That's different than I say something in private, you go home tell your kid, then bring them to me to make me say it to their face.
&gt;it's clear that it wasn't the kid's idea.
Maybe.  I used to teach martial arts classes and I had some kids who wanted to be there, but their parents pushed them to be the ones to ask me.  I had others who talked for their kids, who had no desire to be there.  After a couple decades of teaching, the thing I learned, is that the students who were forced to ask themselves was always the kids who wanted it, while the parents who did it for them, it tended (not always here) to go the other direction.  As a result, I began making sure I asked the kid if they wanted to be there before class if the kid didn't ask me to join.  Many times he said no.
tl,dr; When the kid can ask it more often than not is something he asked at home, just is shy in public.
&gt;to make a point that she really ought to be making herself.
Do you think parents aren't already making that point.  It just doesn't drive home the emotional angle of it.  Here... look at who you've _really_ been saying this to... does.
The problem with all of that, is that the WWE doesn't operate under the same "heel/face" principles that it used to. There are no "heels" or "faces" in the WWE anymore. At least, not in the traditional sense.  
CM Punk more than anyone else is an example of this. CM Punk's character is not a "good guy." He's a jerk. He's always been a jerk. The only difference is that people boo him when he's a jerk to someone they like, and they cheer him when he's a jerk to someone they don't like. That more than anything else separates the motivations of the characters in the WWE. It's talked about all of the time. "You people started booing me, so screw you!" (Jericho, Christian, R Truth, anyone?)  
Sheamus is another example. Sheamus as a "face" character did nothing differently than Sheamus as a "heel" character other than instead of wanting to fight, say, Randy Orton, he wanted to fight Mark Henry, and more people started cheering him.  
Speaking of Henry....Mark Henry has been injuring people by trying to break their legs with a chair, and he's being booed for it because he's been doing it to people the fans like. The Big Show did the same exact thing to Mark Henry and the fans cheer him for it.  
People don't seem to understand that the character development in the WWE Superstars is more than being a "good guy" or a "bad guy."  
Dolph Ziggler is a "heel" right now, but all it takes is for him to get angry at Vickie and start doing his entire same character/gimmick directed toward someone the fans already hate, say like Jack Swagger, and he would instantly be a "face" by nothing more than default, really.  
Of course, the WWE uses certain "go-to" traits to keep certain wrestlers booed and certain wrestlers cheered, for instance Sheamus didn't scissor kick Hornswoggle's head off the other night on Smackdown, because it would presumably make the fans boo him and right now he's more effective being cheered.  
But the point being is that the "heels" are *supposed* to look stupid. That's the whole point. Miz and Del Rio go along with the silly contract signing not because CM Punk is somehow breaking the fourth wall, but because their characters are selfish and opportunistic. If the guy with the power - John Laurinaitis - wants a photo op, they'll give him a photo op because they think it'll help themselves in the long run. CM Punk knows that, the fans know that, and any fan who's seen any other contract signing in history knows it'll end with fighting, and CM Punk pointing that out doesn't mean the "heels" are stupid or being buried. Del Rio and Miz aren't oblivious to the contract signing trope, they simply choose to ignore it because it's not in their interest to go against Laurinaitis.  
That's why I didn't agree with - or frankly understand - why people thought Daniel Bryan trying to cash in his briefcase against Henry a few weeks back was somehow alluding to his "heel turn." He is a character the fans like, trying to take the title away from a character the fans hate. There's nothing "heel" about that. The WWE even had to take it one step further and had to have D Bry do a [wwe.com promo]( explaining his motivations for cashing in, and then basically repeat that same promo on RAW a few nights later when he was interviewed by Michael Cole.  
Anyway, I could go on and on about this, but I probably have gotten my point across.  
**- I disagree.**
The problem here is that I really dislike the blurring of the face/heel lines, too. So it's like, all the problems are compounding one another.
Take Randy Orton, for example. He's a face. He beats the shit out of people after a match he already won clean, but he's a face. His character is "psychopath who could snap and rip your face off at any moment", but he's a face - because he's doing it to people we don't like. I mean, sure, Cody Rhodes called us all ugly and put paper bags on our head, but Orton broke his face in. Repeatedly. Because he could. 
My point is that if a heel would get booed for doing it, why is it okay for a face to do it? What is the point of cheering and booing for any character if the reason comes down to "he's attacking someone we don't like" vs "he's attacking someone we like"? Ryder ran in on Dolph Ziggler's match last night. He caused Ziggler to lose. Then he ran into the ring and hit his finisher on a guy who had just been hit with someone else's finisher. Reverse the names, and that's classic heel behaviour. That's stuff you do to *get* people to boo you. That's how you tell someone is a heel. It's "Sheamus kicking the head off a leprechaun" stuff.
It's like... if the division isn't between "good guy" and "bad guy", what's it between? "Guy we like" and "guy we don't like"? Okay, so what prompts someone to be a guy we like and a guy we don't like? Show got cheered because he was attacking Henry, who got booed because he attacked Koslov, who got cheered because he was a goofy Russian. It all starts with the face/heel division. Things sprout off that, sure, but at the base of it you have to have some sort of reason for the crowd to boo or cheer at least one competitor in there, and if you start making it so that both sides of the coin can attack people after matches then you've lost that as a face/heel marker. Like you said, if Ziggler turned, it would be by default. He wouldn't be a face, he'd just be a heel doing heel things to heel people. CATS LYING DOWN WITH DOGS.
Anyway, back to the heel stupidity thing. Heels aren't supposed to look stupid. Heels are supposed to be outsmarted, which is a different matter. If you have a guy whose character is the only sane man, what does that make everyone else on the show? Like I said, last night wasn't as bad, because it was just the contract signing deal. Everyone knows that shit's going to end in a fight. It's even okay if Punk says "I can win this" beforehand. But if he says "we all know how this is going to go: we're going to fight, I'm going to win, the show will end with me standing above you" and then it happens you've just punched his opponent in the dick. He's been neutered as a character because a) he's doing what Punk says, so Punk's smarter than him, and b) Punk said he would win and did, so Punk's tougher than him. But if the heel runs at Punk and Punk wins, *without* him calling it beforehand, you just get the idea that Punk's a fighter who can beat the heel even if he gets the drop on him, but you don't get the implication that Punk's bored with the tedious inevitability of it all.
Basically - Tom vs Jerry is fun to watch. But you know Tom's never gonna win, because Jerry's too smart for it all. You watch to see how Jerry's going to win, not whether or not he will. Same deal, except that sort of thing is how you kill interest in a wrestling storyline.
**- I see your disagreement and raise you a disagreement!**
Believe me, I understand where you're coming from. In reality, all the blurring does is point out the fickle nature and downright hypocrisy of the mob. I personally find it to be lazy writing and even thought they're attempting to make these characters deep, it's essentially the easiest amount of "deep" needed to get people to react one way or another.  
Also, I think the whole 'explaining what's going to happen and then that same thing happening' thing is a valid gripe. Again, it's just lazy writing, or in CM Punk's case, maybe it is just lazy ad-libbing. But, at the same time, we are being trained to understand that CM Punk is a legitimate champion, and even 2-on-1 he can hold his own in a fight. I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing, I'm just saying that appears to be what's going on. 
**- I see your disagreement and give to you a relatively agreeable response!**
Shallow people do not necessarily equate to attractive people. It also depends on what you consider to be an attractive person. I'm not trying to preach here, but you'd be surprised as to what the tastes of people change into as they grow older. I find myself to be a fairly/slightly attractive 20-something year old male... physically... but my dweebish and non-confrontational personality is what usually turns girls away, even the slutty ones that I don't want in the first place... Girls rarely even talk to me, even though they make up the bulk of my small number of friends... I've been in situations where I thought I SHOULD just allow myself to be a FA because of the women I attracted and the way the relationships would end. It usually had to do with a girl giving me a fake name as long as I dated her, or another one being schizophrenic and telling me her other personality had taken over and that she thought she was a vampire going to kill her personality off, or another one still who decided to join some stupid vampire cult led by a 17 year old from another state because she believed she ALSO was a vampire... Regardless of appearances, batshit crazy just is not worth the trouble and trauma. I've always been afraid to ask girls out, physically attractive or not so much.
I gave up for about a year and decided to try and hang out with one of my friends more, due to us both having incredibly shitty luck with people and dropping friends. I hadn't really seen her as being all that attractive before, although she was kind of cute at the time. It was just the personality that really did it for me... She stayed up late talking to me more than a few times and helping me out of some bad times I was going through... I finally worked up the courage and ended up asking her out... She moved away (about 3 hours away) two weeks later, but tried her damnedest to see me as much as possible. She's dropped a shitload of weight every time I've seen her since
People don't need to be perfect for you to fall in love with them. While looks can certainly help even in the slightest ways, it doesn't help presenting yourself as a cold, tortured, lonely person. If it helps, date a fucking blind girl.
 DATE A FUCKING BLIND GIRL! Even better, go on a blind date with a blind girl.
Pretty much the only reason to own Nintendo systems is to play the first-party Nintendo titles. 
Both titles are very friendly to new players of either series, while not disappointing players familiar with Zelda and Mario Kart. I'm also really impressed with the level of polish on both. Zelda has hints should you need them at any point in the game, and Mario Kart's online mode is the smoothest in a Nintendo title so *far.
* it's hard to just answer "yes". 
Standard business practices have yet to catch up with how we buy/sell content. The "midnight release" has been a bit of a marketing ploy/tradition for quite a while now, but that was before Amazon became as omnipresent as they are today. Now that Amazon is so popular, business practices are shifting (thus, some titles have Release Date Delivery), but not everyone is on the same page about this. Like Dvius said, retailers generally get their product just a day or two before release. Things are changing so that retailers like Amazon can get product early enough to ship in time for release date delivery, but right now we're still in that "shift" between standard/accepted business practices.
we're ahead of our time
I don't come from a religious family and my parents more or less left me to it belief-wise but I went to a wonderful little Church of England and up until secondary school I considered myself a christian.
At about the age of 5 our regular teacher was away and we had a substitute. She set us the task of picking a bible story and making drawngs to be put on the wall. Being the hipster that I was I picked a story that we had not been told in class but I had heard in church (my grandmother took me when she visited). Everyone else was doing the good samaritan, jesus in the desert or Adam and Eve. I chose the story of Abraham, only I got it wrong.
In my head God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son who then takes his son up to the mountain, can't bring himself to do it, refuses and God reveals he has past the test. So my picture was Abraham and his son on the Mountain, a sword on the floor, and a big hand coming out of the cloud and pointing. I finished it off with a big speech bubble from Abraham saying "NO!"
As the drawings are being pinned to the wall the teacher notices mine and asks me which story it is supposed to be, I tell her, and she asks why Abraham is saying "NO!" so I tell her, she tells me I made a mistake and that Abraham passes the test by saying yes. I can't wrap my head around this as it seems to make no sense whatsoever, I tell her it is her who has it wrong, she then makes the mistake of 'correcting' my picture. As a child one thing I could not stand was people drawing on my pictures so  lose it and call her "a stupid" and tear up my own picture.
I don't actually remember much off this myself, It was recounted to me by my old teacher (who had been away on that day) on my last day of Primary school, the substitute had told her what happened. She told me she has never been so proud of one of her students and she had repaired and kept my picture.
 Even 5 year olds can spot the dubious morals in the Bible.
I was in your shoes last week. I was dead set on a 570 as I feel that nvidia has superior drivers, then my laptop with an nvidia card started having problems and it turns out the nvidia forums are full of desktop and laptop users that have extreme driver issues that have been ongoing, unfixed for many months now. I decided I may as well try AMD again and got this [Sapphire 6950](
So far I have been extremely impressed. I flipped the BIOS switch as soon as I opened the package, installed. It successfully unlocked the extra shaders. I then OC'd it to basically 6970 levels, which is what it is performing as now. Everything has been smooth, the driver installation, the gaming, I am loving it so far. The hottest it ever gets is 70 degress when playing BF3 on Ultra settings. I am definitely thinking about getting another to CF in the future.
was in your same position. took a gamble with a 6950 and have not regretted that for a second. 
I both agree and disagree with you.  Many people don't think about performance when writing applications.  On the PC, that's partially a good thing - not that they don't care, but that they don't have to.  It's great that today, people can spend more time building applications, and adding features than squeezing every bit of performance out of them.  It means better software, because we can do things the simplest way.  It means more software, more features, more eye candy, etc.  Part of the reason we have 4GB of RAM is this.  That RAM is there to be used.  Firefox uses absurd amounts of RAM, but on the other hand, RAM is cheap, and optimization isn't.
Obvious the phone is a different animal and performance is much more constrained.  However, embedded processors are at the point where they are reaching performance levels of a few years old PC.  We are now fabbing quad-core &gt;1GHz ARM parts that have some serious power, and phones with more RAM than some people have in their PCs.
Second, the higher-level language actually alleviates some of the problems you mention.  Don't have to worry about someone mallocing MBs of memory, because it's abstracted by the language.  Or cleaning it up, or preventing memory fragmentation.  That's all handled automatically.  Check some benchmarks for C# and Java.  They are nearly as fast as C/C++ and faster than some compiled languages.  JIT is seriously fast because you are running mostly or all native code.  Also, on Android, some libraries are native.  Graphics, for instance (according to Google's Dalvik JIT seminar) is native, so graphically intense applications are suffering little even under the pre-JIT Dalvik interpreter.
&gt; My old flip phone had a calculator, calendar, ring tones, T9 txt, etc. It took maybe 5 seconds to 'boot up' and maybe 2 to shut down.
While Android's boot is slow and the UI lags on 1GHz or slower single core parts (which IS unacceptable), I never had any phone, smartphone or not boot in 5 seconds.  You also have to realize the difference.  Android is a full Linux system, with tons of services, and background stuff.  It's a very flexible system.  Your non-smartphone can not do anywhere close to the things that Android can do.  Any system that runs on a variety of devices is going to have bloat, because there are things that are specific to some devices that need to be included, in addition to the abstraction needed to allow that.  You could probably build the same UI to run in 1/10th the resources, but you wouldn't be able to install apps, and it wouldn't run on the amount of phones Android runs on.  Consider how awful J2ME apps where in the pre-smartphone days.
&gt; It went a week on a charge.
The screen uses *far* more battery than any other component.  Android phones have much bigger, and brighter screens than those other phones, which of course means you'll use it more, using more of those resources.  I too think this is unacceptable, and would gladly buy an Android device that's a little thicker and &lt; 4" in exchange for 2 solid days of battery life.
&gt; Basically we've taken a huge hit in usability for the sake of making it easier on the programmers.
I know what you mean, but usabilty refers to ease of use.  I don't think you mean it's harder to use, but less responsive, which is true.  Flexibility comes at a cost...either more expense, slower, or needs way more power.
&gt; Or if you opened your microwave door and it kept going for 3 seconds, what kind of hell would you raise?
The microwave only does one thing...this IS why I don't want a computerized toaster, microwave, fridge or oven.  Also, the microwave's function, cooking, is *not* instant.
&gt; because it's easier than compiling for a few different architectures.
That is very close to what JIT does.  It compiles to all supported architectures, but on your devices, which reduces the original application size, allows more aggressive optimization (otherwise NO apps could use SIMD or floating point, since not all ARM processors support it), and minimal download size, with support for any architecture with no effort from the developer.
&gt; And people have long accepted that you need to reboot windows machines a lot, and that it's performance degrades over time. The number of devices that require a reboot periodically is ridiculous.
Stability on any new system will take time.  Gingerbread is much more stable than earlier versions, and it will get even better.  On 2.3.7, my battery dies far more often that a reboot is necessary, and even Windows is so stable, I can't remember the last time I rebooted a Windows box.
&gt; An emulator is acceptable because it can be optimized per platform and has a fairly constant performance lag when in use.
Emulators are terribly slow, worse than even scripted languages.  In an awful language, take PHP for example, library functions are in native code, so you never notice how slow it is, because most processing-intensive things execute with no overhead.  In an emulator, everything is slow.  Everything must be decoded, translated and executed at the instruction level.
Now, bytecode languages are very similar to emulators, the difference being they are designed for this purpose, and thus execute faster than emulated applications, using much less overhead.  And, they lend well to JIT, which when done correctly (C#), gives a constant performance boost, running at as near native speed as possible on all architectures.
As Android evolves, and the JIT adds more optimizations, it will get faster.
 JIT gives all-around best case scenario, when balancing portability, performance, and system resources.  Android's performance issues are not directly because of JIT.
Long time eagles fan speaking. Haven't been to a whole lot of home games, maybe 10. I hate the reputation we get, but logic dictates that you don't get reputations for nothing. Yes we threw snowballs at Santa. Yes we cheered when Irving had a potential career ending injury. Yes we totally annihilated 49ers fans with snowballs. I guess we made Casey Matthews fiancé cry. I can't defend any of these things. Please keep in mind though that I personally didn't contribute to these things. I did, however, find two vikings fans after last years home game loss that fucked our whole playoff seed and told them "great win guys, we played like shit and you deserved to win." I was unlucky enough to be seated next to two giants fans this year at our home game. Unlike my friend, I stayed until the very end, and although there was shit talk during the game, I shook their hands and said "good win." Its not gonna change any perceptions of our fanbase, but to group everyone into being total pricks isn't fair. That's all I have to say about that. 
I'm doing my best to not be a total dick because we have an awful rep, downvote away 
Man up, tell yourself to stop being a beta noob, and be a confident alpha, go say "hi, enjoying your night/day?"
It does not happen instantly, you cant just be PRO with women, you need to practice, get comfortable, get confident. 
start with Looking, eyecontact is important, NEVER NEVER BE FIRST TO BACKDOWN. you got this you need to SMILE, smile is 100% important, it can make someones shit day awesome, just by seeing you happy as shit.
if you notice they smile back, i have made it a rule " ALWAYS SAY HI".
even if its a "Hi.... (and then run away*)". still hi, once you get better you can talk more.
practice small talk on cashiers ect, they are paid to talk to u and be nice, so 0 threat.
continue also smileing and saying Hi, just walking past strangers. anyone that smiles back. JUST DO IT YOU BETA.
from that, build. progress. but you gotta start somewhere, no one is going to hate you for saying hi, they wont remember you tomorrow. 
i have had full conversations with people, and they forget me the next day, "especially cashiers" i find they get into a trance at work and everyone is just a stranger. 
once i went in twice once day (we ran out of beers around dinner) seccond time same person, she mentioned "weren't you here yesterday?" and it was less than 4 hours ago.
proof tested. 
 Start smileing and looking at people, if they smile back, ALWAYS SAY HI, Build on that as soon as you can. 
Recruiter here.  All of those characteristics are implied as needed for the position.  It goes without saying that in today's competitive market being a positive, quick-learning team player is a necessity.  Having these traits intrinsically will lead to success in the interview process, however on a resume, this is just fluff.  
The resume's purpose is to illustrate skills and/or relevant experience directly correlated to the job scope and requirements.
 don't need that kind of "profile" on your resume.  Stick to measurable skill sets and accomplishments. 
Lots of good points, but it over-stated the costs from the unions. The legacy carriers, in addition to (formerly) having high labor costs, also have fleets of old, less-efficient aircraft. These require more fuel and more maintenance. This also requires more crew training (pilots must get rated on different aircraft, as must mechanics, etc...) which raises labor costs. SWA used to have lowest labor costs in the industry largely because they only had one type of aircraft (737) rather than 10 types, because they didn't assign seats (thus saving labor for the gate agents), etc.. 
 CEOs like to blame unions for their own mismanagement. Wages do matter, but SWA paid their workers well and still kept costs down.
I mean like they are always in the fast lane. They will cut you off with no mercy. And in LA, the right lane doubles as a parking area at certain hours of the day. Usually when you stop at a red light. They will be the ones to pull up on your right side and then slam the gas and cut you off in the middle of the intersection in order to avoid the car parked infront of them. It's not that the prius performs anything like a ferrari. It's that prius drivers think that their prius is capable of anything. 
***: Prius drivers are cunts
I killed Heimskr also (who hasn't?) as soon as I entered Whiterun. It was my second character, and I didn't want to deal with his annoying ass. Fast forward a couple hours later, and I get attacked by some thugs. I check their bodies for the contract so I could see who sent them after me. Turns out, it was Heimskr.
 A dead guy put a bounty on my head.
I think so yes. You just get a different set of challenges.
-- holy fuck, I just read your entire post instead of skimming it, and it sounds creepily like my last relationship. O.o
I'm the introverted guy, and I kind of failed on the regular long distance contact thing. It can be pretty damned hard, even if you enjoy the time you spend with the person.
Well, I can't help you with much, but I can tell you that when he doesn't want to talk it's not because he doesn't like spending time with you or anything.
A lot of the time for me it was because I just didn't know what to do when not with someone in person. I mean, as a really introverted and shy person, interacting with people in person can feel pretty awkward and challenging. Now, for some people it's easier online, but for others (like me) it can be harder, especially in a 1 on 1 relationship context. When you're in person, a lot of the time you can communicate what you mean without saying much. Trying to do this over the internet can be really frustrating.

Anyway. From the perspective of the introverted guy, it's hard to even realize we're being kind of distant/not communicating enough, because it just feels comfortable to talk to someone once a day, while missing a day now and then.
For me, even with someone I love, and would like to spend at least some of every day with in person, it just doesn't bother me at all to go a while without seeing/talking to them.
*** for all that^^ Us introverts just aren't as bothered by not spending loads of time with the people we love, and it requires taking a step back to notice other people might not feel the same way a lot of the time.
Try and see if you can talk to him about finding an amount of interaction that will keep you happy, and if it can't be done, well, then you might need to move on. That's really not advice I want to give, but if that level of contact is what you need to be happy in a relationship, don't accept less than that for an extended period of time.
Totally relevant. I just woke up 30 minutes ago not remembering how the hell I got to bed. Last thing I remember from last night was watching Half Baked on the couch. The last part I can remember was when the dog gets high and jumps out the window. I'm guessing that's the moment the cannabutter cookie I ate hit me. If I had fallen asleep on the couch I would have woken up there, but yet I woke up in my bed as normal? Didn't send any embarrassing texts or facebook messages, so what the fuck happened?
 Woke up 30 minutes ago can't remember the end last night 'cause I was so stoned.
Oh, and this made me remember, here's a study tip if you want to try it (it works for some people but not others oddly).  Study the material you need to for like an hour, then take a 5-10 break where you do nothing. Seriously, just sit and relax, and think over stuff a little (possibly run through everything in your head).
If you try to do stuff during breaks like even listen to music or looking up stuff on the internet, sometimes your brain doesn't get a chance to "soak up" whatever you were trying to and instead takes in something else.  This helps me a bit so you might want to give it a shot.
**** Don't engage in something that involves taking in information when taking breaks at times.
Because "pitch black" is a lie.  There are always photons even in the dead of night (and especially in a urban/suburban area where a slide like this will be).  All you need to do is keep the shutter open long enough to let the same amount of photons in that your eye would see in a 20th of a second under normal lighting conditions.
Keep a shutter open for long enough and anything will look like daylight.
I like this, I really do, but the problem is that so long as Israel views every possible threat to it as an existential threat, they won't be willing to be a partner for peace. In the eyes of the Israeli government (and AIPAC, so therefore much of the US government) Iran's nuclear program represents a threat, and therefore has the capacity to destroy Israel as a whole. As long as they pursue it, Israel will justify all acts of aggression under that idea. They are the quintessential realists, saying that because it is in Iran's interests to destroy the Jewish state, they will do so once they have the capacity. They point to Iranian funding of Hamas and Hizbullah as examples of this, and because they see Iran as fundamentally wanting their destruction, they will overlook or even acknowledge and not care about their own hypocrisy. 
Israel thinks every imaginable threat is an existential one, so they won't ask for peace.
Three mice are sitting in a bar in a pretty rough neighborhood late at night trying to impress each other about how tough they are:
The first mouse slams a shot of scotch, and pounds the shot glass to the bar, turns to the second mouse and says: "When I see a mousetrap, I get on it, lie on my back, and set it off with my foot. When the bar comes down, I catch it in my teeth, and then bench press it 100 times."
The second mouse orders up two shots of tequila. He grabs one in each paw, slams the shots, and pounds the glasses to the bar. He turns to the other mice and replies: "Yeah, well when I see rat poison, I collect as much as I can and take it home. In the morning, I grind it up into a powder and put it in my coffee so I get a good buzz going for the rest of the day."
The first mouse and the second mouse then turn to the third mouse. The third mouse lets out a long sigh and says to the first two, "I don't have time for this bullshit. I gotta go home and fuck the cat."
 Mice are stronger than humans.
Gotta bang everything that walks. Pump up your self esteem while degrading your view of women. When you feel better and are ready to get serious again you will have commitment issues and bounce around from shitty girlfriend to shitty girlfriend. Then you will settle on some bitch, get married and have kids. But you will divorce and she will take everything. 
Welcome to manhood. 
chill, hang out with friends and family and work on yourself. 
It's not a matter of "can't" it's a matter of "wouldn't". I can almost guarantee that if, hypothetically, building another pyramid were to come up in a serious conversation with an engineering team, the question of "why" would be a tough one to answer compared to a lot of other design solutions. "Because it looks cool" doesn't carry a lot of weight, especially when you factor in the cost, time, and use of resources.
We could do it, but we won't.
I live in NYC and St Marks is actually incredible. There are multiple professional, sterile, and well-run tattoo parlors and the headshops typically have impressive selections. The "sketchy" places are the street vendors that sell cheap outerwear, no-name pipes, and also do tattoos. Fortunately their business is limited and no one gets inked there anyway.  stop running your mouth kid.
First, I'll say that I haven't argued that boosters *must* be banned from the game, only that they can't be left alone to do whatever they want. That said, I can see why IW (and Treyarch) often decide for the full ban.  
  
The overall goal of the punishment structure to make boosters feel that the rewards of boosting aren't worth the investment of time and/or money sunk into the project. In other words, deterrent value.
  
The more harsh the penalty the less likely entry level boosters are going to be to get into it. Big example cases like this scare off a lot of people, kids in particular, who may be able to live with a leaderboard ban but not a lifetime ban of their cherished gamertag, or even a console ban.   
  
You also want to discourage people you've punished from jumping right back into it by making it as inconvenient as possible. A leaderboard banned account can still be used, for example, as a dummy account to be killed by the boosting account, not so of a lifetime banned account.  
  
Still, the more serious punishments need to be part of a larger structure and not the only available punishment. Temporary bans, leaderboard bans, and stat resets all have their place in the scheme of things.  
  
**TL:DR** *Deterrent value--the fewer people get into boosting, the less resources have to be spent tracking down and punishing boosters and the more proactive you look to your rule-abiding customer base.*
My blade seemed to have gotten quite dull, quite suddenly. But, as always with questions of this type, the best answer is obtained by trying it. As you know, the answer to most shaving questions takes the form, "I do x with result y. YMMV." What works or does not work for me may not work (or work) for you. 
 Try it.
When I was about 10, My dad was driving me and my friend to a "Christmas concert" at our school and we realized that we had forgetten to buy out teacher a christmas present, so we stopped at the liquor store to but her a bottle of wine, he told us to wait in the car in the parking lot and when he left me and my friend decided to collect the change from the cup holder and leave the car to go to the 711 next door to the liquor store. When we got back my dad was franticlly looking for us and thought that we had gotten kidnapped because the car doors were unlocked. He started yelling at us in the parking lot, a lady saw and she thought that he was being "abusive" and called the cops, later that night the cops came to my house and my friend and I were playing blackjack with poker chips at our coffee table, and they started questioning us about if my dad was an alchoholic (the wine) and why we were gambiling (he thought we were going to actually use money) 
The cops came back to check on me twice after that. 
My dad got mad at me in public for a good reason, and a lady called the cops, when the cops came to my house they found me and my friend gambiling at the coffee table and  came back twice after that to check on me.  
I worked at a horse farm that did pony parties were we would bring ponies to a location and lead them around while children rode (generally for birthday parties or church events). Before we start letting kids ride, we would normally talk to everyone as a group and lay down some ground rules, like "wait in a line for your turn," "be nice to the animals," and always "don't walk behind the ponies." 
We were working at a park in a poorer area of town when this happened, which generally meant a lot kids running around and parents off drinking or talking without really paying attention. We gave our speech and started letting people ride and the parents of the kids go off to start drinking, meaning we now have 50 some-odd kids running around not being watched. We have one kid who repeated walked behind the horse and is yelling and screaming who we repeated asked to stop. (More of a "hey hun, please dont do that you might scare the pony) He finally ends up running up to one of our ponies and poking it square in the butt, hard. The pony tenses up and my boss at the time grabs the kids arm and pulls him from behind the pony. The pony doesn't do anything but we hear a woman of the group of adults start to scream "GET YOUR HAND OFF MY GRAND BABY" and "I"M GONNA CALL THE COPS ON YOU" My boss explains the situation to her, she still calls the cops. 
The cops show up while we're leaving (it was a one hour party and we had another to get to) and basically say they totally understand, the woman was crazy, and that we're fine. They then go on to ask for some cards for they're own kids parties. It was all kinda surreal.
 Kid pokes a pony in the ass, boss moves kid, crazy grandma pissed cause someone touched her grand baby, cops lol at her
Sounds like overbearing parents. If the kid is smart enough to get into college, wouldn't that mean the parents are trusting enough to assume he can handle college situations?
 "Hey mom, dad, I'm checking in. Be home late" "WE CALLED THE COPS! SCREAM IF YOU SEE THEIR LIGHTS!"
Back in Oct 2001 (less than a month after the attacks on the WTC) I went to Vegas to get married at the Excalibur. Went through the whole ceremony thing, had dinner at the tournament, then kicked around Vegas for a bit. Some free drinks, Jell-o shots at the monorail, etc. I had gone ahead and rented a room with a jetted tub (located on the top floor, with the tub located in the turret). In my alcohol induced idiocy I decided that it would be a nice romantic gesture to pick up some bubble bath.
We finally find our way back to the room, I get the water flowing and pour in the bubbles. I have opened the windows, afterall we are on the top floor and no one can see. It was odd that they opened all the way and there was no screen, but that isn't important. Yet. 
Tub is filing, bubbles are getting made a little too slowly for my liking so I turn on the jets and Great Googaly Moogaly the bubbles started growing like a marshmallow in a microwave. As the suds rose past my chin I reached for the button for the jets and I could not get them to turn off. I was pushing and pounding over and over again. At this point the bubbles were a good 4 feet over the height of the tub and something had to be done to get rid of them.
Now the lack of screen becomes important. Since We had an open window and a bunch of bubbles we decided to start pushing the bubbles out of the window and let them drift ever so softly down to earth. We get most of the excess bubbles out, the new wife goes into the bathroom to shower all the suds off and I am left out in the room trying to clean up the mess. The phone rings, the front desk is calling to let me know that LVPD is on their way up to talk to me. I holler into the bathroom and tell the new wife to stay in the shower as the cops are on their way up.
Seconds later there is a knock at the door, I open it and there is a LVPD officer, he politely asks to come in. Let me set the scene here for you. There is an empty bottle of Champagne on the floor, a wedding dress tossed against the foot of the bed a tux laying on it and a trail of bubbles from the tub to the shower with several clumps of bubbles around the tub and everywhere. I explain about the switch and its failure to turn off,he kind of smiles and explains that several of the loads of bubbles I tossed out the window found their way to land on another officer standing at the front door many floors below. He nicely tells me that even bubbles shouldn't be tossed out of the window as there are rules and such and bids me farewell whilst chuckling to himself.
tub flub suds flood plop on cop, asked to stop
EDIT:formatting and general dumbassery
Was over a friends place and a couple of us were playing marco-polo in the pool. 2 girls and 2 guys, were were around 12-13 at the time. I was chasing one of the girls and she was screaming (the fun kind of scream just trying to get away). Well like 15 minutes later or so some Cops come by and asked if everything was alright. 
Turns out a neighbor called the cops because they thought some girl was being raped in the pool. One cop laughed it off, but the other was kinda mad about the neighbor. We were just fucking kids playing in a pool how stupid are some people. 
Played Marco-Polo, cops were called because they thought we were rapin bitches
My friends and I have this tradition/competition where we get a huge crowd at a parking lot one night 3-4 times a year and watch a bunch of us attempt to drink a gallon of milk in an hour. We had been doing this for a year and a half without issues for now.
So the people start drinking, about 15 minutes in, 5-6 cop cars from two different townships (to be fair, the township line was one of the streets bordering the parking lot) all swarm in, lights flashing, at least one had dogs in it, etc.
Long story short - an old lady had called, under the assumption we were having a dogfighting ring in the parking lot. Why? Prior to this, we had gotten dinner at a restaurant across the street. And one of our friends was claiming that he wasnt going to participate. So on the phone, a friend calls a mutual friend of the participant, and jokingly says "You're his mother, you're going to have to tell him we'll have to get rid of him". The old lady then walks up to us and goes "Excuse me, I couldn't help overhear...but are you guys discussing fighting dogs?". We explain the competition, and as she walks out of the room, the entire group of us bursts into laughter at the absurity of the situation. She and her husband give us very dirty looks as they leave the restaurant.
The cops then watched us puke up milk for about 15 minutes before leaving, after questioning our intelligence and saying "Why not just watch it on youtube?"
**** Gallon of Milk in an hour leads to cops being called thinking there was a dogfighting ring.
It's true that this is how most police are, and every run-in I've ever had with a cop, they've proved to be down-to-earth guys who are actually pretty cool. When I was 17, I was playing "hey mister" (Where you stand outside of a convenience store and try to get people to buy you beer) at about 3 in the morning with my friend who was 16 at the time. We were trying for about 45 minutes until I said "Alright, one more try and then we're done."  
The next guy to pull up had his dog in his car and seemed really chill. We asked him to buy us beer, and he asked us what we wanted. We told him just a 12-pack of Natty light, or whatever cheap beer they had. He took our money and said "Okay, I want to let you know I'm going to buy you kids this beer but I just want you to see this." The guy whips out his wallet and shows us his badge. He was a fucking cop, and I was flipping a shit inside my head, until he said, "I'm only doing this because I remember what it was like being a teenager and trying to buy beer in the middle of the night."  
He got us our shit, and even gave me my change back after I told him he could keep it. As he was pulling away he called out of his window, "Don't ever let me catch you doing this shit again, though!"  
Friend and I asked a guy to buy us beer outside 7-11 at 3 in the morning, he showed us his badge, proving he was a cop but bought it for us anyways, informing us he remembered what it was like being in our situation.  
My old roommate and I had the cops called on us while we toured an empty house that was for rent. One of my clients (previous) was a real estate company and I decided to source them for places to rent. Because we were cool with each other, they'd just give me the supra code (door lock box) so I could get the house key and go in on my own.
This house had the power turned off and on top of that, it was getting dark outside. Because of this, I had to use a flash light to tour the place. 
The neighbors saw the light in the house and called the cops on us. While we're walking down the hallway, I see a flash light shine in the front door which was wide open. I'm thinking "Hey maybe someone else is coming by to see the place" and then I hear "GWINNETT COUNTY PD!" and a gun rounds the corner pointed directly at me. Needless to stay I almost dropped a loaf and started shouting "I have a key for the house! We're just looking at renting it!"
They quickly drop their guns and start asking some questions. The cops thought it was hilarious and actually advised that we don't move there because the neighbors were "Too damn nosey"
*** Neighbor called the cops on us while we were touring a vacant house for rent thinking we broke in.
Truly the best ***EVER***
This will get buried but oh well.
One summer I worked for PennDOT (road construction for you non-Americans).  I was allowed to bread a few road rules, namely u-turns wherever I wanted around the construction site.  I used my own car and was supposed to have a little flashing yellow light on the top, but PennDOT had not given me that yet.  So one day I am eating lunch in my car under and overpass.  After I finish my PB&amp;J I pull out and begin a u-turn to get back to work, but a cop car pulls me over right in the center of the road.  I get pretty nervous and while I wait for him to come up to my window I prepare my explanation.  He asks me to roll down the window and before he can say a word I launch into my drawn out explanation: I work for PennDOT so I’m allowed to do a u-turn here, they just haven’t given me a flashy light yet, here’s my badge to prove it, etc…  I get done talking and he just stares at me for a second with a funny look on his face then asks me, “Do you feel alright?” 
“uh yeah… I’m fine”
“you sure?”
“yeah, yeah, I’m fine”
“well we got a call saying there was a dead person in a car described as yours under this overpass”
*TL/DR:* Someone driving past my parked car called the cops telling them I was dead while I was in it eating a PB&amp;J
I went to a college that had a big deaf community. You would think that being deaf would mean that they would not complain about loud noises... but it was the opposite. One day they called the cops on us and we were pretty much just sitting down watching TV, half of us were sleeping. I opened the door half asleep and asked what was wrong. They just looked inside, looked puzzled, and said there were noise complaints, then just left and told us to keep it down... I just laughed in his face. This began a war with our neighbors and I was really the only one pissed off at them... Whenever we had a party they would grab a broom or something and would start making sounds on the floor for us to turn the music down (we really didn't blast our sound...) When this happened we would blast the music for 15 mins so they would call the cops, then turn it really low... so when the cops came they would be puzzled. Eventually cops stoped responding to their calls ;D Oh, I also had a friend that worked at an ambulance that would tell us whenever there was a call for our apartment. That was the shit :D

 Deaf people called cops about noise complaints when were were sleeping. 

I don't mean to be a burn elitist, but I have a blistering second degree burn taking up most of my middle finger tip from improperly handling metal that had just been welded.  And as if all that wasn't bad enough, it's my fappin' hand :(
 [You don't know where I've been](
What does mean?
I was having a house party at my house pretty late at night (early morning ish) when the local busybodies decide to phone the police. Now, my parents are very, very paranoid so we have cameras all along our property and a gate that auto-locks at 5pm and opens up at 7am. Now, in order to get in your have to do one of two things, enter the proper code or, as the police did, drive your car straight through the gate doing $9,000 worth of damage to it.
Now, the police illegally entered our property and then attempted to force their way into my home when I told them they were not welcome. Eventually they released that perhaps what they attempted to do was not the best course of action so they camped out outside my house saying they were going to look for "any suspicious characters". Now, my friends and I weren't drinking - we were just raving. I had them spend the night at my house and when we woke up 7 hours later to my mom yelling about the gate we had the pleasure of explaining what happened later. 
Now, after four lawsuits against the city I live in the police have finally paid for not only our gate to be fixed but also all of our attorney's fees.
 Cops attempt to bust up my party, do $9,000 worth of damage to our gates and wind up getting sued by mom and dad. All thanks to some busybodies who could not control their phone the pigs impulses. 
My Grandma lives in a retirement community, (Owns her own home in the community, totally independent.) and a few months ago she needed back surgery. My brother and his friend had gone to her house to pick her up a few books. When they get to the house they go in, grab some of the requested books and proceed to walk out to the car when 4 squad cars come screaming up the street with sirens, lights, the whole nine yards. The Cops proceed to draw their guns on my brother and his friend and order them onto the ground. 
A few minutes later the cops realize whats going on and apologize for the theatrics. My brother asks why they were called and apparently my grandmas neighbors assumed that my brother and his friend must have murdered their neighbor (My grandma) and proceeded to call the police and tell them that a couple murderers were looting her house. 
 Brother and friend went to collect some books for grandma, neighbors thought they were robbers/murderers, called the cops.
A day or two after 9-11 I was working in St. Louis, Mo. and was tasked with providing manhole locations contained in a 40 mile fiber optic loop that my company had just installed.  The guy I was working with was wearing a backpack GPS with the antenna sticking out the top and we walked to each of the manholes and collected the point.  
While walking through a rundown part of the city a cop car pulls up with  his lights on.  Two cops get out and ask us what we are doing and they wanted to see the backpack GPS.  They looked everything over and started laughing because they received a call that we were terrorists spraying anthrax.
**People from the 'hood in St. Louis thought they were the next target of the Taliban.**
I worked on a independent movie shoot that was done mostly at a suburban house.  The producers had all the right permits, etc, and had put out fliers to all the houses on the block letting them know what was going on.  Most everyone thought it was awesome ("hey a movie is being shot in our neighborhood!") except this one busybody who among other things kept calling the police out, making up stories on what was going on (my favorite being that we were shooting a porno).  The police were nice and apologetic and getting frustrated because they had to keep coming out for BS.  Finally on the 5th time they decided to wander by her house and lo and behold she had broken a parking and a couple of other city ordinances which netted her 3 tickets.
 Don't piss off the cops unless you've got all of your shit straight.
Hahahaha, oh god, I got just the right story for this.
So I moved into this student accommodation and one night me, a friend, my ex and her ex (don't ask) was watching TV. Some girl who moved in  with us 3 weeks earlier and had systematically fought everyone in the house stormed out of the house suddenly. We thought she just had to go somewhere.
About 30mins later there was a knock on the door and there was 2 cops standing there telling me there's been a report of a huge party going on. Now, the accommodation and especially our apartment got party complaints pretty often so they insisted that they come in. They found 4 people having a Buffy marathon. I dunno if it was the cops or us who were more wtf'ing at the moment. Now after checking quickly to make sure we didn't somehow hide all the party guests between the 30 secs it took them to come in, one cop said..."Buffy, huh?"
Me: "Yep"
Cop:"I Like Angel"
Me: "I Like Spike better"
Cop:... "Keep it down"
Turned out the crazy bitched called the cops. Bonus: It was like 10:30 and the nutcase don't work or go to school. 
 Cops come to investigate giant loud party. Found a 4 person buffy marathon. 
During high school one week, my friends and I decided to play capture the flag in the park when it was dark.  It was about 10pm during the summer and we thought it would be fun.  We were right, it was seriously awesome.
Rules: You have to put the flag in a lighted area and the flag must be visible.  Tagged enemies were escorted back to their own side where they had to wait for a count of no less than 30 Mississippi.  Exception to this rule was the flag guarder, who could tag people and not have to escort.
So I guess the people that lived near the park called the cops because we were making too much noise.  Instead of sending a squad car over, they send *the fucking helicopter*.  They shine the light down on us, illuminating the entire field and taking all the fun out of it, then they start yelling at us over a microphone I guess to desist what we were doing.  I don't think it helped that a couple of my friends at that point ripped off their shirts, got down on their knees and started bowing to the helicopter.
A couple minutes later, 2 cop cars show up and we go talk to them.  They say that there were noise complaints and that we couldn't be in the park.  We inform them that it's a public park and it doesn't close until midnight, so we still had a right to be there.  We politely tell them we are going to continue our game and that it was a waste of taxpayer money to fly the helicopter to break up a capture the flag game.  They leave and we get to keep playing.
HELICOPTERS, MAN
My girlfriend and I, plus 2 other people were playing crib in the second story of a quadplex appartment. It was 7:30 at night when we hear a knock on the door.
The police officer answers, looks at me and peers inside and says: "we've uhh.. received a noise complaint... umm.. regarding your... umm... party.." I explained what we were doing (playing cards) and said he was welcome to come in and inspect the raucous party we were having. He sort of hung his head a bit and said "sorry to have wasted your time, we're obligated to follow up with these kinds of complaints, enjoy the rest of your '*party*'. 
He then shrugged at me and walked away shaking his head. It turns out that the 19 year old in the bottom level was pissed off that moving a chair across the floor woke her baby up - her 17 year old BF and babies father was too scared to come ask us to settle down our "party".
 4 people playing a VERY quite game of crib at 7:30 at night on a Saturday and the cops show up.
It was my friend's birthday party and they were all about 16 or 17, sitting in his basement watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Someone's phone pocket dialed 911, and needless to say what they heard was most disconcerting.  Cops swarm up, lights a-blazing to find a relatively quiet teenage birthday party.  We explained to them what had happened, and what we were watching, but they didn't buy it.  They split up the boys and the girls in order to question them separately.  When questioning the girls, the cops insisted that it was okay, and they could tell them what happened.  In the end, they had nothing to go on and pretty much accepted what had happened.
 Phone pocket dialed 911 with Texas Chainsaw Massacre playing in the background.
This one isn't about the police, but the fire company... At the time I was renting a house, it had a small back yard and deck. As night fell we had lit a tiki torch in the backyard. Fast forward a couple of hours. Everyone is inside, but we forget about the tiki torch, which was still lit.  We hear a fire engine with sirens blaring coming closer and closer. We expect it to keep going, but it stops in front of our house. We thought it was odd so I go to check it out. When I get out there I see three fire me heading into our backyard. I go in the back and the fireman are laughing. Our neighbor thought our backyard was on fire because of the lit tiki torch. The firemen asked me to put it out. So I take the cover and drop it over the flame. The firemen were all laughing.
TLDR fireman were called by a neighbor because of a lit tiki torch.
Edited to correct the autocorrections.
One night last summer I was playing release with my boyfriend, older brother, and about 10 other friends.  We went back to our old middle school which was on the same grounds as our church.  Some guy who used to coach my brother's soccer team called the cops on us for disturbing the peace.  We hadn't raised our voices above speaking level and the grounds were huge.  The cop was very cool however and let us off with a warning.  Yes, call the cops on teens who are playing tag at the church.
 cops called on us for playing release on church grounds while there are much worse things happening in the area.
My roommates and I were moving into our house off campus and we had two cars in the driveway so one of my other roommates parked in front of our own driveway to unload his stuff. Our psychotic 60 year old bitch of a neighbor called the cops and had them write my roommate a ticket for blocking our own driveway. 
A couple days after we had moved in the woman came over and started yelling at us about our lawn not being mowed or something trivial like that and kept yelling "where is Eric" (one of the previous tenants of the house I guess) and she refused to believe that the previous students that lived in the house had moved out and that we were new people.
**- crazy neighbor calls cops to write my roommate a ticket for blocking our own driveway when we were moving into our house. Also refused to believe we were new tenants and kept demanding to speak to the old ones who had moved out.**
Pull into the 7/11 to grab some beers with a buddy one night after the bar. Douche in SUV pulls up next to us, gave me a dirty look. I might have yelled something out the window, I don't know. The only reasonable thing to do was grab the bat from my backseat and start waving it around.
Once we get the beers and are walking back to the car, cop pulls up and stops us on foot. Asks for IDs. Then he says, "we got a report of someone waving a bat around. Do you know why we'd get a call like that?"
I said yeah, probably because I was waving a bat around.
All told, there were six cops that showed up eventually while we were being questioned. Ridiculous. I had a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the bat was waved, and not one of those pigs asked the obvious question: son, have you been drinking tonight?
waved a bat at someone, everything went better than expected.
This will probably get buried but here goes nothing:
So, when I was 12 or 13 I lived in a house high up on a hill with a windy drive way that connected to a shared driveway with a canopy of trees covering it. Needless to say at night it was creepy and dark. One night my dad screamed to me from the bathroom "Hey, go get the mail". It was 10pm and he had obviously forgotten about it till he decided to take a shit. After searching for a flashlight to no avail I told him I would only go if one of my 4 brothers or sisters would come with me. After some pleas to not go down by myself light-less and getting killed in the woods he screams, "If I come out of this bathroom and there's no mail waiting for me I'm going to beat the living shit out you" Fast foward 5 minutes later I dont have the mail and the chase begins. He chased me up and down the stairs and through rooms till I finally got into my sisters room and locked it. He started banging on the door "I'm going to kill you! I'm going to fucking kill you!" I got scared shitless and called the cops. They come and after one of the cops talks to me about how I'm disrespectful he hands me his maglite and tells me to go get the mail.
Cops came to our house over not wanting to get the mail.
I was like 7. My dad was playing a baseball game in a park in some sort of "dad's only" league. Anyway, the park is right next to a nice, upper-middle class neighborhood. So, foul ball and lands in someones yard. Some other kids and I run over to get the ball because that's what bored kids do at baseball games. This lady comes out of her yard and freaks that a ball is in her backyard. Dude, you live next to a baseball field. This has to happen at least once a week. Anyway, she comes up to the field and makes a big scene and calls the cops. 
Cops come and get the ball from the backyard. At that point it doesn't really matter because they have more balls to use. So like, fuck it. She could've kept that ball. Big fucking victory.
baseball lands in lady's backyard that lives right next to baseball field. is cunt.
Had a band with some friends in high school. We used to rock out in the garage after school and occasionally on weekends. There was an older lady who lived next door that didn't like all the noise. She called the cops, and they shut us down. We weren't that upset over it, because we were pretty loud. So we did the responsible thing and soundproofed the garage so that we could proceed with the rocking out.
Well, after we soundproofed the garage, and made sure that you couldn't hear us outside of the garage, we proceeded with the rocking out. Until...the old lady next door called the cops on us again. The. Next. Day.
The cops were initially frustrated with us, because they saw us as repeat offenders. But then we showed them all the work we put in with soundproofing and demonstrated that they couldn't hear us if they stood outside the garage. Very cool of them to let us defend ourselves on the spot, and of course, we were in the clear.
We found out that the old lady called the cops because she saw my buddies' cars outside and decided to go vigilante on us.
 Soundproofed a garage so we could rock out, old hag still calls cops because she sees more cars than normal outside, and doesn't like others having some fun.
I remember the first time I saw a real shotgun.
I was four, my brother was six.  I was wearing my Superman PJs, he wore his Spiderman PJs.  We had a superhero wrestling matches, but being bigger and older, he always won.
Spiderman can NOT beat Superman in a fight.  He was playing wrong.  Superman should win.  Obviously, this was a matter of national security. I dialed 911.
"Don't do that!" Spiderman yelled as he slammed the phone down.  It was another battle of epic proportions.  I'd grab the phone and auto-dial 911, and he'd wrestle it back and hang up.  We must've called and hung up on the 911 operator 20 times.
When the police surrounded the house I was in tears because I thought I was going to jail.  It wasn't supposed to be like this.  Spiderman answered the door and explained the situation.
My grandma was a terrible babysitter.
Not cops, but fire marshall.
Before I start, I should pause a moment and explain the history we have with our elderly neighbor. He is an author who works from the cabin. French, grumpy by nature but not an unreasonable man. His house is about 50m from ours. There have been incidents where, after letting the kids be in charge of the fireworks, some may have strayed onto the roof of his wood cabin, or where we woke up the whole valley by drunkenly chainsawing firewood at 4am. On the other hand, I also mow his lawn, shovel his driveway (not a small feat) and maintain his home when he is away six months of the year. I say it's a fair arrangement. Free labour in exchange for occasional disruptions to his peace and quiet.
[here]( is a pic of my fire pit. The fire in the pic is NOT the fire in my story. Just take a look at how high the walls of the pit are, how far back they go, etc.
So here we go. 
At my cabin with friends, sitting around the bonfire, making some [pie irons]( playing some guitar and telling old stories.
The fire we had that night was a slow-burning fire (what you would call a cooking fire. Mostly coals). I had also noted that the fire hazard in the area was moderate so we kept it to a slow burn.
We were, however, making a shit ton of noise. Music, singing, laughter, all that horrible racket. It was about 9pm.
Suddenly I hear what sounds like a huge truck coming down the road. Next thing we know, the local fire marshall is parked at the edge of the property, flooding the yard with highbeams from atop his crazy water truck (the guy came prepared to put out a brush fire).
He marches onto my property, takes a look at us and our fire and starts laughing before telling us that he got a complaint about an **out-of-control fire** from "someone in the neighborhood".
At first, he couldn't even *see* the fire. Then he came around to the side of the pit and complimented us on our "very secure" fire area and commended us on having water buckets and a hose within reach (I should mention that three of us present are Chief Scouts of Canada?).
Anyways, he stuck around for a bit and had a beer. We sent him home with a few pie-irons for his kids (two cheese, two cherry). He gave me his card with his personal cell number on it in case of emergency.
Overall a great experience. The next day when I spoke to the neighbor, he admitted having made the call. We were interrupting his writing. I apologized and invited him to call ME the next time we were bothering him.
He moved to Costa Rica about three years ago. We bought his house. Fewer neighbors = fewer problems.

Back in college I worked a part time job at a liquor store during the summers. It was in the suburbs of a major city, in a relatively upscale area, so crime, and thus interactions with the police, were fairly rare. One weekday evening, probably around 8pm or so, the phone rings and I answer it, thinking it would be the usual "do you have this wine" or "how late are you open" type question. Instead it was a police officer who in a very solemn voice identified himself and asked me if I was "currently under duress." As would be expected, I was very surprised and so my vague "nooo?" answer only served to make the cop even more suspicious. His next question was "Is there someone in your store with a gun? If you are unable to answer you can just say 'were open until 10' and hang up, and I'll know its a yes." By that point I had regained my bearings and explained to the cop that I had no idea what he thought was going on, but that I was fine, and that there wasn't even any customers in the store at the moment. He replied that he needed me to walk slowly out the front door of the store, and look to the right, where I found an officer with his gun drawn.  
Long story short, one of the last customers before the call apparently walked down the tequila isle, noticed the 'Tommy Gun Tequila,' (for those who haven't seen it, the bottle is shaped like a real Tommy Gun) and held it in his arms like a gun. Some lady, presumably walking or driving by outside, saw this and assumed the store was getting robbed by people with 'machine guns,' which she then relayed to the police. The police took this report very seriously, and surrounded the whole whole damn building.
After we had sorted things out and figured out what happened, the police (all 8 of them) grouped together in the tequila isle and had a good laugh while cracking jokes about a woman mistaking a bright red glass bottle of tequila for a real machine gun. 
Some lady thought "Tommy Gun Tequila" was a real gun, called police, the whole force showed up 
Probably going to get burried.

Two summers ago I was coming back from a trip to Estonia/Latvia. In the process of flying back to Canada we had a stopover in Helsinki, Finland. One night, just one fucking night.
Its 11pm and we're expected to be on a 7am flight the next morning. I'm still repacking my suitcase at this point. While in the process of repacking I find some of the goodies that I bought while on holiday; a set of air-soft pistols (realistic looking toy guns that appear somewhat real).
Being the stereotypical gun obsessed pubescent male that I was I couldn't just repack them. I take one out, one which has a laser pointer attached to it, turn on the laser and point it around the room.
That's the end of that, so I repack it, fold up everything else that has to go into my suitcase and go to bed.
12:30 rolls around and there's a knock at the door.
"Wtf"... I go to answer, look through the peep-hole and its covered up... I ask; who is it? All I get is a rather firm and gruff "open up".
So against my better judgement I open the door and am immediately confronted by a complete Finnish swat team, there's a taser pointed at my face and six guys in full riot gear just staring at me for half a second.
So I give myself up... But actually, within that half second I'm grabbed by one or two of the guys, face down on the floor and handcuffed. They sit us against the wall in the hallway as they proceed to search the room for weapons (from what I understand _handguns_ are illegal in Finland?).
I explain there are toy guns in my packed suitcase, I may have said something to the effect of "they're fucking toys". They find and inspect the guns, confirm that they are indeed toys and let us go.
Finally, and I shit you not, as they're leaving one of them turns to me sheepishly and says; "Enjoy the rest of your stay in Finland".
**** In possession of toy guns in Finland, swat team called to hotel.
Edit; squats.
I'm going to flip reverse this because my Girlfriend once called the police on a housemates dick boyfriend, but housemate and said boyfriend can't believe to this day that she did it. 
Basically, housemate was seeing a guy who was a completely unpredictable, bleeding heart emo brat. If housemate would talk to another guy, there would be blazing rows in her room that would last most of the night and would result in banging, furniture breaking, death threats and crying. 
On one particularly bad night, he went off and my girlfriend and her other housemates heard a shriek and a thud. They ran into the room to discover their housemate on the floor covering her face and the guy stood over her. They tried to intervene but he forced them out and closed the door. 
She went next door to knock on and ask couple of strangers for help (which happened to be me and my best friend) and we kicked the door open and tossed him out and stayed with them for a bit. 
After things had calmed down, myself and my housemate went home and they were all putting the room to rights and tending to their friend when there was a knock at the door. 
They answered it, and the boyfriend was sat on the stoop with a kitchen knife. No threats against them, quite calm, telling them to tell XXXX that he was going to kill himself. Like a coward, he didn't want to face up to his actions and would rather have everyone feel sorry for him. Two of my girlfriends housemates were trying to talk him out of it and wake up the harassed housemate. My girlfriend just called bullshit and called the police. 
She still gets flak for it to this day from some. But really? Abusive, unpredictable brat of a boyfriend hits his girlfriend and barricades them in her room and then comes back later with a knife threatening suicide. 
**- My girlfriend called the police on a housemate's abusive boyfriend after he hit her and then showed up at their flat with a knife threatening suicide. And some people think she went too far for doing that**
Does anybody else find it hard to believe?
As a young teenager, a group of 6 people, including me went to go play football on a road that was out of the way. Well, we knew that a car was there, so we moved down about 50 or so feet. After one of my friends sailed the pass over another friend's head, the ball started rolling until it passed the car. We picked the ball up and started playing again. Ends up that there is a Chinese lady who lived in that house. She called the cops on us, remember we are about 12 years old, and said that we had hit her car. The cops smirked and told us to be more careful. They asked her why her car wasn't parked in the garage, and she said that she used it for storage.
Crazy Chinese lady calls cops because she saw the ball rolling behind her car 
Ok so I am loud. Loud at talking, loud at laughing, loud at sex. My whole family is sort of loud. 
We moved into a very nice neighborhood from another nice neighborhood and decided to play some evening board games.
Suddenly cops. They asked if there had been a domestic disturbance since someone had reported hearing loud banging and angry yelling maybe a gun going off. He looks in our Leave-it-to-beaver house with two adults playing monopoly with three under 10 kids. 
The houses are not close together and we are obviously not beating on one another. So the cops leave. Turns out they checked out the house next to us and found the crazy German lady who stole neighborhood cats fully dressed hiding under the bed, obviously beaten.
 Loud children summoned the cops, crazy germans arrested.
When I was in HS I was friends with a bunch of suburban punks and skinheads. I had some kids over at my house one day who had mohawks, liberty spikes, or shaved heads. We were hanging on the lawn and one kid decided he wanted to play music so he starts blasting Beethoven from his car. Ten minutes later the cops show up and tell me that my neighbors called about a disturbance. The cop rolled his eyes and asked us to turn the music down. 
 cops were called bc a bunch of punks were blasting Beethoven from a car stereo.
This is more an "I can't believe what the cops did" story.  I was in college.  A few friends had chipped in to get a hotel room for the night after a "College Ski Fest" event at a nearby ski resort.  It was basically a festival of drunkenness, and we invited several people back to our spacious room to party during the evening.  No great surprise when we get management knocking on our door at 10:30 PM telling us to be quiet or we would get kicked out(we had been pretty loud). We ended the party and everyone went to bed.
About 30 minutes later, the police are pounding on our door, kicking us out.  The room was dark and silent (and had been for at least 20 minutes) before they showed up.  They told us that management had asked us to leave and they were required to escort us from the premises.  I pointed out that we were quiet, sleeping and DRUNK.  None of us could drive, and it was well below freezing outside.
The police replied "You are required to get in your vehicle and remove it and yourself from the premises."  When I pointed out that that would be DUII and I could be arrested, he assured me that he would not bust us for DUII even though they knew we were drunk.  He advised us to drive just off the property, pull over, keep the car running for warmth and sleep it off for a few hours, but said that if we chose to drive all the way home he would not pursue us or advise other officers to be on the lookout for us.
 Police forced me to drunk drive.  Seriously.
I have a [this 75mw]( green laser pointer from nova lasers. it bright enough where you can CLEARLY see the beam of the laser. i use it to point out stars and constellations to friends.  
  
Anyway about a month or two after moving into my new apt, my friend and i are out of my balcony and pointing out constellations. after awhile one of my neighbors comes out and yells at us( so we go back inside).   
  
45-60 min later my friend decides to leave, and 5 min after that i get a call from his cellphone. it isn't him on the phone, but some guy who is saying he is part of the swat team, and telling me to come out of my apt with my hands up. I am thinking its my friend messing with me and left something in my apartment. So i go to open the door and see a REALLY fucking bright light shining on me.  This is when i start to think that maybe its not my friend just fucking with me, still really fucking confused though. I have never done anything wrong, i have never even been pulled over.  
  
I am still on the phone at this point and the guy on the phone tells me to slowly walk down the stairs with my hands up and towards the light.  when i get there there are 4 swat cops with rifles telling me to get on the ground (which i do with no resistance) they hand cuff me and take my friend back up to my apt. So now i amr super fucking confused and have absolutely no idea what in the hell is going on.  
  
the swat officer then asks me where my gun is (i don't own a gun). The officer proceeds to tell me that my neighbor called the swat at me because he thought i was a sniper ready to shoot people (with a green laser beam point right back to where i was). after the cops search my apartment for a gun and they don't find any, and after i show them the laser (and they play with it for a bit), they let my friend and i go.  
  
All through out the ordeal the officers where very nice. a month or so after this happened my neighbor who called swat on my moved out and i was much happier.  
  
  
** neighbor called swat on me for having a green laser pointer.**
When I was 17-18, we used to paintball religiously in a patch of woods near by. All the kids in the neighborhood would use old clothes, we were jobless. So I had sweatpants, denim shorts, long sleeve shirt, and a regular t-shirt, I played straight up bum style. So we all meet up in front of the woods and make teams. I realize I forgot my hopper at my house, so I ran home with my gun. They start the game without me. I ran back and as soon as I got to the entrance of the woods, I hear paintball shots going off, so I crouch, and quickly start to load up my hopper. I heard someone step on a branch behind me, I turn around with my paintball gun ready to fire, when there was 4 cops standing there about to pull their weapon out. I lowered my paintball gun immediately and they asked what was I doing. While paintball guns shooting off in the background, and kids yelling "I'M HIT", I told them I was playing paintball. They loled and told me to be safe and left.
Almost got executed by cops because some dip shit thought they saw T1000 running through the neighborhood.
We used to live next door to a really, really odd guy, who I'll call "Bob".  He *hated* anyone near his property, even though where we lived, the houses were somewhat close to each other, and on a busy road.  So he routinely looked out his windows to babysit his yard, which is fenced 100% around, and he would come out to yell at people if he thought they were too close to him.  

So, one fall day, one of my family members and I were outside raking up leaves.  It was a windy day, so some were blowing a little bit, but not too bad.  All of a sudden, here comes a cop.  We have no idea what's going on, but we live in a small town, so a cop pulling up isn't a huge deal.  So the cop comes up and says, "Bob says you're putting leaves in his yard."  Meanwhile, we're standing AT the pile of leaves in question, which the cops sees, so he says he's going over to talk to Bob.  Bob clarifies, and says that there are leaves touching his fence, and that's the issue.  The cop comes back, pretty annoyed, because there really aren't many leaves anywhere besides in the pile.  So he grabs our rake, gets the few wandering leaves, puts them into the pile, and tells Bob to go inside his own house.

A couple of leaves touched neighbor's fence, cops were called on the leaves.  Cop raked up said leaves.
This is probably too late in the thread, but:
When I was about 16 or 17. My sister called my mother and I freaked the hell out because she said there was someone/thing in the house. It was one of the first times she'd been at home alone, she said our cat was going crazy. My mother and I assured her it was just her imagination.
A couple hours later my mother and I get home and everything is normal - our suspicions confirmed. About 5 hours later, I'm talking to my mother around 11 pm, sitting in a large easy chair in our living room and I notice some scuff marks on the curtains. I say, hey what happened here and begin to pull up the curtain.
At that moment a squirrel jumps up and comes about 3 inches from my face, before falling back to the ground. He was trapped beneath the curtain and couldn't find his way out. So my mother decides to call animal control, but they're closed for the night, so the town sends out a cop, my former DARE teacher.
Upon arriving, surveying the situation she states, "I don't know why they always send me on these calls, I'm terrified of animals." With the police officer of no assistance, we devise a plan where we place some laundry baskets in the entry to the hallway to hopefully block the squirrel. I'm going to move the chair and then attempt to chase the squirrel through an open door onto our porch.
I move the chair and begin running at the squirrel. He races toward the door, runs past another chair, past the coffee table and is about 5 feet from the open door. Everything is going perfectly according to plan. Then, the squirrel veers right instead of left, hops on another chair runs up the back and jumps into our open piano, where he runs into a corner and promptly falls asleep and begins snoring.
I poked him with a broom handle and even played the piano trying to wake him up, but nothing worked. Eventually we had to call a private animal control company to come remove him. Crazy night.
 Squirrel got into my house, police officer afraid of animals is dispatched, I chase squirrel into piano, squirrel falls asleep.
Hah!  We used to play capture the flag in a pocket woods next to a buddy's family's apartment back in high school.  About the third or fourth time we set it up I got there late because I had to work.  I wander through the woods and can't find anyone so I walk over to my friend's apartment.  His mom and sister are there and tell me I need to get home and away from there as he and all of our other friends had just been arrested because someone had called and told the police that there were kids doing Satan worship shit in the woods.  I think the actual charge they used was trespassing or breaking curfew, but shit, Satan!
Narrowly avoided being arrested for Satan worship.
I was in my apartment with my roommate playing some Call of Duty. Nothing special goes down, then one of us goes to the bathroom only to discover that one of our other roommates has left a giant bridge of a shit in the toilet. After much flushing we ascertain that the engineering of the shit is too well done for meer flushing and that either an act of god must occur or one of us has to push it down. we get into a heated argument over who has to do the deed and we resolve to wait until the guilty roommate gets home and make him destroy it. I go to make some mac'n cheese and my roommate smokes up a bowl. 10 mins later we get an agressive knock on our door. I open it to find two cops asking if he have a party going on. Standing in the doorway topless in sweat pants reply no. The cop does not believe me and says they got a complaint of a party and loud raised female voices from our apt. They ask if they can come inside just to make sure we did not stash a party in our closet. I let them coming in figuring I have nothing to hide (forgot my roommate had just been blazing on the patio) They start to walk through the living room (not a big place so does not take long to check it out) and my roommate, freaking out because he is high, tries to find a book to read so as to appear inconspicuous and picks up the only book he has on nearby. since he is a religious studies major this turned out to be the Bible. So the cops get to our room and find my roommate, high as a kite, perched awkwardly on his bed reading the fucking bible.
 cops got called because my roommate took a huge shit.
Better late than never right?
When I was 17 I had an older car that I would occasionally work on just for fun.  I wasn't good at it it, but that didn't stop me from taking things apart to clean them, occasionally spray paint them, and put them back on the car.
One night I was up late (2-3am) working on my car, and had the garage door cracked for ventilation.  Suddenly I heard a car pull up to my house, 2 doors close, and footsteps walking up the driveway.  Immediately I thought "burglars", grabbed a utility knife, and stood next to the door in a "ready to strike" position.  Thankfully right as I was about to "strike" the people identified themselves as cops quickly enough before sticking their heads under the garage door to prevent me from attacking them.  Good move on their part.
I then spent 3 minutes proving I lived there.  Even after showing them my driver's license they were skeptical, but eventually said "we're sorry some people don't have anything better to do than call us about dumb stuff"
Apparently my neighbors thought that someone broke into our house, and in the middle of the burglary, decided to stop and work on the car in the garage.
 Neighbors called cops while I was working on my car in the garage at 2am, because they thought burglars stopped to work on it during a robbery.
I think it's really great that you've acknowledged this and are actively seeking to change. You might want to just try to get more women in your life and try to have normal, everyday conversations. You don't have to like all women, some women will be really boring to you or seem stupid or childish or have interests that are completely incomprehensible to you. That's okay. Some men are like that too. Just find out what the women around you are interested in, you might find that you share a love of cooking or short stories or whatever you're interested in with her. Focus on these qualities and recognize that she thinks in a way very similar to you sometimes. She's a person, she has interests and flaws and quirks and habits just like you do. 
I think your sister has left you with the feeling that women get to just coast through life and have everything handed to them. This might be true for some women, but it is also true for some men. As you start to realize that women are people just like you are, you might start to get to know some of them better and figure out that they have had a hard childhood too, maybe they had to work for everything that they have or got very little love from their parents or don't even have parents anymore. Just because the women in your early life had all the fun and got everything that they wanted doesn't mean that all women grew up that way.
Everyone is human and there are awesome, boring, and terrible people in both gender categories.
Had this awful red, oozing, crusting, swollen, reoccurring rash around my eyes. Doctors in my area kept treating me for conjunctivitis. Went off to college, problem got worse. It took three visits to the student health center before they realized that they had no clue what was going on and that squeezing ointment onto my eyeball wasn't helping so they sent me to a local eye doctor. After four or five visits there, my doctor realizes that it was a skin problem and most likely an allergic reaction. I went to an allergist near school and then took a 5 hour bus ride to a dermatologist that took walk in appointments. Shitloads of steroids, antibiotics, and ointments later, I decided to take a leave of absence to deal with this problem (and depression) because worrying about this and spending a few hours a week going to different doctors was making my anxiety and depression worse (hearing "what happened to your eyes?" made me more self conscious than usual and resulted in me spending more time on the Internet where people can't actually see me.)  After two visits to a different dermatologist, we realize that the reaction was only around my eyes and that I was probably allergic to my glasses (made of stainless steel). Taking the steroids and not wearing my glasses made the area around my eyes almost normal again and nothing has flared back up. Patch test results show that I am allergic to iron. 
spent four years and hundreds of dollars an allergic reaction to my glasses that told half my doctors it was conjunctivitis. 
I'm telling you if we destroy television everything will get better.  Just let me destroy television.  It's the reason we're not all pissed off together.
A very unfortunate percentage of US citizens get all their content from the tv.  The same tv that's used to keep important thoughts out of your mind.  Thoughts like, "Hey free speech just went out the window WTF is going on?" Or "Wow protesters are low-level terrorists now, that doesn't seem right."
An easy way to see that tv is a weapon of the corporate arsenal is to look at it in comparison to the internet.  No one has ever threatened to take our tv away.  No one is writing crooked bills to limit the tv.  That's because the tv is already perfect for what they need.  It keeps you from thinking about important things and focused on meaningless bullshit  aka reality television and sports.  
The information that comes out of the tv is controlled therefore it can stay as it is.  The internet is the opposite of tv (for now).  The user has the control.  Not corporate interest.  We can't say whatever we want on tv but we can on the internet.  And the only thing the corporate agenda hates more than our ability to say whatever we want is when we use that ability.  The internet is the last refuge of free speech and that is the reason it's constantly under attack and television is not.  
The internet is the only thing we have left keeping us "we the people". It's the only thing left that unifies us as the people.  If we decide, "Actually, fuck the government",  the internet will be our only weapon.  Why do you think Egypt shut it down so quickly?  It was obvious that the internet was powering the problem.  
[ So I've ranted out all of that to say this:  If we can't protect our only remaining voice; our only (mostly) untouched right, we are fast approaching a time of crisis.  And without the internet a time of crisis will only yield chaos.  We can overcome these great injustices we are facing peacefully, but only if we act now.  If we let them take our last tool we are left only with weapons.  
the government is a reflection of the fucking assholes who elected them. if you want to point fingers, the first place you need to point them is in your own direction. 
democracy is a failure for the same reason reddit is a failure. idiocy rises to the top via the american idol voting system. we are an idiocracy pandering to the uneducated retards valuing consensus over common sense because everybody is a sackless faggot too scared to point out the emperor's new clothes. 
as long as we put karma at the end of the carrot stick, we'll always have mindless faggots running the country.
**** we throw stones in the glass house we created. we hate democracy's effect yet are enslaved to the mindless ease of ruling by popularity.
That's what I did... 
Just a little bit at the end expressing the goings on in legislation recently being like some kind of authoritarian horror story, pleading they not let the nightmare come true. 
And it is *EXTREMELY* easy to do your part everyone. 
If r/atheism can clear $100,000 in donations for DWB, there's no reason every redditor can't do his or her part with no donation required. And we the informed redditors  should take this and x-post it to all social mediums available to us. 
: It's easy to make your voice heard (see link in top comment). Do your part and spread the word. The future of the internet, nay, freedom, could depend on it. 
I think we're exaggerating a little bit here.  Sure, we have a shitty political situation, and sure, we have corruption, but compare it to the corruption in politics elsewhere. Here, we're worried about having our representatives bought by big corporations. In many other places, even those ostensibly "democracies", their representatives don't do ANYTHING for their constituents without some sort of bribe or incentive.  Here in the US, we at least have a small minority of reps that will actually stand up for their constituents' voices. We can send letters to our reps and get actual responses without having to go crazy in the process. We can get passports, dispute our tax returns, register to vote, and get a driver's license without having to continually grease the wheels with a continuous stream of greenbacks at every level. 
It may be bad, but it's not *that* bad.

Try this experiment; close one eye, and hold your fingers 10cm from your face. Now bring those fingers into focus with your one open eye, and notice how everything in the background, behind your fingers, becomes very blurry.
Now, keeping focus on your fingers, move your hand further from your face. Your background should become less blurred.
So, tilt-shifting photography mimics this behavior by making the background very blurry, which in turn makes the in-focus objects appear smaller.
Your brain is used to blurry backgrounds meaning that you are focusing on something very close to you, and so details that appear sharp in a picture with blurred back/foreground seem like they are very small.
The "everything is either good or bad" mechanic in fallout games has always been dumb. 
It's dumb in every game it's in. 
There are many situations in fallout games where I as a player have made decisions that, out of context, seemed brutal and horrible but when looked at in a broader sense are arguably good. 
**Story time [if you don't like reading skip to the end]**: I was using the FWE mod and various others to make the game more difficult. I started my game as a [former] slave, and gave myself many crippling weaknesses but a few strong points to introduce challenge and unique gameplay. I wandered out of my starting point in search of water, as I was merely an hour or two away from dying of dehydration. I stumbled upon the ruins of an old town filled to the brim with raiders. The sun was setting, and under the cover of darkness I made my way around their dwellings, stealing whichever supplies I could find. I still hadn't found water, and the effects of dehydration were starting to be more adverse. As I was leaving I happened across 2 bottles. I was overcome with relief as I proceeded to sneak out of their camp. Just as I had begun to relax and feel a bit safer, I stepped over a trap and had to sprint. Just before getting out of range I took a single well-placed shot to the leg and became instantly crippled, using the shadows to get out of sight and sneak away, hanging on to life by a thread. I use the only stimpack I had scavenged to heal this wound, but because of this mod the benefit is only temporary. I will still die if I do not gather medical supplies to triage the wound and prevent any further injury. 
It is about 4AM now and I have covered a good bit of distance. I need to make it to a town to see a doctor. As I make my way over a hill I see a town on the horizon, but it is doubtful that I will make it in my current condition. Oddly enough, there is a man sitting against a rock looking toward the sky, as if under a trance. I approach him and he initiates conversation with me, asking for water. I deny him, and begin to walk away. Before I do, I glance in his pockets to see if he is carrying *anything*. As it turns out, he has a few stimpacks *and* a little bit of food. I decide that I will take these from him, and use the money I get from the supplies I sell to bring him back some water. 
While pickpocketing the second item, he catches me and begins attacking. In my current condition I cannot take any risks, I have to fight him. I draw my blade and end his life in a few skillful jabs, and then continue making my way toward town. Along the way, I begin thinking....
"Was what I just did wrong? Is my drive for survival proper justification for ending this mans life? Do any of these morals really matter out here?" I even begin questioning some of my real life morals.. "In an apocalyptic situation, would I be willing to abandon my principles and morality for the sake of survival? Would I ever give my life for the things I believe in or don't believe in?" 
Now to summarize **[SORTA A **: Out of context, I just went up to a poor and seemingly harmless man, denied him water that I *had*, then proceeded to kill him and take his things. I of course received negative karma for this. But *in* context, was any of this really wrong? using the money from the supplies I scavenged previously, I helped many like him and went on to do a fair bit of good. Was that action still morally reprehensible? Was what I did *good* in the grand scheme of things? do the ends justify the means? 
I still wonder about these sorts of things. 
A side note, this is why I will consistently defend that FO3 and FNV are better games than skyrim. 
That entire game is, to this point, all about being the special snowflake. This is cool, but unrealistic and hard for me to personally get into. 
I can sink dozens of hours into fallout because I feel like I'm a small part of an expansive world. I feel like a little insignificant spec in this universe of uncertainty. Every action holds weight, but when viewed from a broader sense reminds me of my inherent human insignificance, and it is a truly humbling feeling that no game has provided since, or at least not as well. 
Sorry if this is a bit much, I just really really love fallout and wanted to discuss the morality system in it. **also, if anyone liked this sort of narration to fallout playthroughs of themed characters in a brutal and challenging setting, a friend of mine has done a handful of them over on teamliquid.net, I can link them if you want**. 
NCR isn't actually socialism. If you look into some of the other terminals, they are all actually pretty much the same ideals, just NCR is an more of an oligarchy, and Mr. House is the concept of a benevolent dictator. They are all actually incredibly similar, and you also missed a few endings, depending on if you decide to go with Yes Man.
The only real difference between the three rulers is the way that they rule. Both House and Caesar represent the intelligent dictator, just Caesar is looking into the future, while House is trying to rebuild the past. The NCR is too wrapped up in trying to gain control of land that they have no clue what's going on. And this leaves us with option of a free Mojave, with no dictators, and people just living day to day.
 I try to think of what Moira said in Fallout 3: you can't rebuild the glass structure of the old world, but maybe you can make it into something more beautiful. The true romantic future would be to let the Mojave run free.
 They are all totalitarian, just different in their methods of ruling and their views on the future.
Thank you, this is the one of points I missed playing NV, and now to think about it, I think it's because in the first 3 games (I've have played them all) [Brotherhood was kind of the "good guys"](/spoiler). So when playing New Vegas, I started to see them in a different way [(bunch of loonies)](/spoiler), but not enough to understand why House wanted to [eliminate them](/spoiler) and how that actually fitted with House's character very well.
This was actually one of the reasons I chose the "Wild card" ending. But just one of many.
 [Didn't understand, why House wanted Brotherhood eliminated, I thought that was the weakest part of the game's writing.](/spoiler) Now I understand it better.
It's more than seeing the *names* of the groups, it's seeing the mindsets of the groups represented as well.
Fallout 3 took a **lot** of liberty with the organisations, The Brotherhood and The Enclave being the chief examples, which if you've played the first two Fallouts you'll see straight away. But even things as simple as the gangers and Super Mutants are represented in a much more black and white manner than any other game in the series.
Fallout: New Vegas shows us the old names, and then shows us what those old names have become/how they have reacted to certain situations. The Brotherhood is exactly the same as it was in the first game, the only difference being that their isolationist/zealous policies have become a massive hindrance with the development of the outside world.
The NCR on the other hand has very much progressed along the same lines it was hinted it would in Fallout 2. The only major difference I believe is the loss of mutant equality large segments of its society once preached.
I agree that the *tone* of New Vegas is fairly different in a lot of places (mainly after you hit the strip). It has been described as a post-post-apocalyptic setting (by Avellone I believe), which I think is fairly apt. I personally think this is a failing, but then I also greatly prefer the Vegas gaudiness over the Hollywood kitsch of Fallout 3's attempt at the subject matter.
*** Fallout 3 tried to be Fallout 1 and failed in many areas. FO:NV tried to be Fallout 2 and overdid it in places.
That's incredibly reductionist, and it's unfair to both the players and the fans. On the matter of emotion, imagine the books or the TV shows you grew up with. Or, hell, the ones you're into now. Saying that watching sports shouldn't have emotion is a lot like saying that you should approach art without emotion. And yet I still can't listen to *In Your Eyes* because of what it reminds me of; if I do, I bawl like a goddamn baby. In the same way, sports can make us emotional. For example, I've been an Islanders fan all my life. I can remember growing up in the years they were always a solid playoff contender, but always out within the first two rounds. And now, they're the absolute bottom of the barrel. On the other hand, I can remember feeling on top of the world as a Yankee fan in 2000, before some of the most frustrating years for Yankee fans in recent memory. Followed up by a World Series win to christen the new stadium. Hell, the Super Bowl is a great example of why sports SHOULD be emotional. Even getting the chance at a Super Bowl is extraordinarily rare. Players spend their whole lives training, day in and day out, in order to reach the point where they have a *chance* at *making it to* the Super Bowl. With the extremely physical nature of football, long careers are rare for a lot of the positions. These players only have a limited number of chances to reach the Super Bowl, and to come so close to one of their life's dreams and fall *thiiiis short* is an incredibly emotionally trying experience. Comparing it to losing a video game is ridiculous. The amount on the line is really hard to understand because you and I are unlikely to be in a situation where one day's worth of work can define how we view our entire life's work. (Unless we're talking MLG that is; while I'm not much of a hardcore gamer myself, the amount of training that goes into eSports is incredible and in many ways just as demanding as any pro sport.)
 Just because you have no investment it doesn't mean that nobody has an investment, and just because you have nothing on the line it doesn't mean nobody does. 
I would like to let my opinion sink in on this situation. 
I don't understand why saying that someone who is fat is gross is a problem. Being fat is (in most circumstances) a decision. If you would like to be fat then why are you getting upset when people call you fat
? If you don't want to be fat stop blaming advertisements or poor self esteem for your problems.
I don't understand why there is any debate on this. I am not saying that everyone needs to be a supermodel or super attractive, but there is no reason to think that someone who is this overweight is not to blame for their body. 
There is no actual legal reason to stay skinny, and I do not think there should be. But I do not understand how people can get upset about getting called fat when they are. 
TL; DR 
If you want to be fat go ahead, but you are not allowed to get upset when people call you fat. 

My best friend started sending me links to stuff he thought I'd find interesting.  Slowly, I asked more about this reddit thing and he gave me a basic overview. (different topics, subscribe to the ones that interest you, etc).
I became so hooked on reddit I demanded that we start dating immediately.  It worked :)
**- he send this bitch some links.  Bitches love links**
True story: One of the LT's at my unit had a similar situation happen to him IRL. He was flying a UH-60 on a rescue mission in the persian gulf circa 2004, someone had taken a nasty fall of a dock. Anyway, he's in a hover putting a line down for the rescue swimmer when someone locks onto his chopper and keeps the lock on without firing for what he said seemed like hours but in reality was probably a few minutes while the rescue swimmer came up with the casualty.
 This is a real strategy to get the pilot to fuck up something due to nerves.
It kind of does - when a pilot uses it, it has a different more squealy tone and a square reticule lights up, so if you move your chopper around putting the sights over flags or roads (or typical MAA hidey holes) you'll more often than not spot a vehicle (or soflam) that you might otherwise have missed. It'll stay lit for a short while if you obtain lock by keeping your sights lined up with it for a second or two.
It also allows your gunner to lock on to aircraft with the guided missile, if you've lit them up - and a flare doesn't break it, so as long as your gunner doesn't fire too early, between you you can take down pretty much anything.
 Laserpainter is awesome once you learn how to use it.
What most "sniping" teams fail to realize is, youre supposed to take a shot and when you take someone down, move up! Of course the team will fail every time if the objectives aren't being completed. Being an aggressive sniper does work and I've done it before. Most of the time there's guys that just stay in one area the whole game and that does shit for team work. Who cares about K:D anyways. 
aggressive sniping works; campers failboat. Forget about K:D ratio

The Warrior, Thief, and Mage stones all give +20% to their respect skills which is better than the Lover's Stone bonus. None of these stack, you must pick only one.
The well rested bonus of +10% (+15% if you're married and sleep with them in bed ;) does stack with the Guardian stone bonus.
So you're losing a potential +15% bonus xp towards whatever skills you want to improve by being a werewolf. But if you're good about switching Guardian stones as needed (e.g. Warrior for leveling smithing, Mage for enchanting) then the relative difference between having +20% and +35% is only a 12.5% increase in xp comparatively, which isn't that huge.
 As long as you use one of the Guardian stones (i.e. Warrior, Mage, Thief) to help level up you skills faster you're golden.
I wish I could upvote this more than once. I actually had someone who had gotten something for free as a promotion come in and try to return that item. I tried to tell her that since she wasn't charged for the item, I couldn't give her any money back for it. She got really mad and eventually the manager gave her a store credit for it.
 Bitchy customer wanted to return free item, ended up getting credit for it.
Here's my take on it.
At first, SRS seemed like a place where people would go to point out crazy things that actually got hiveminded up into the top comments, like the original "stormfront or reddit" posts that started it all. It seemed like a place where people could point out these posts and discuss them openly.
Boy, was I wrong.
At first, it was like that, and then two things happened: a massive mod circlejerk of epic proportions, and an influx of what I like to refer to as "butthurt" posts. 
I believe the evolution may have happened this way: the posts started becoming a place for anyone who was offended by anything said by anyone to repost it, so it degenerated into picking posts that were merely off-color jokes or insults that were upvoted (sometimes, they were even FUNNY! Imagine that!). 
Some of the jokes and insults were obviously not funny, and there was a point to pointing them out as generally un-classy behavior, but most were just jokes that could be offensive. Honestly, how many jokes out nowadays are offensive to someone? A lot, it seems. I'd imagine that if SRS started singling-out comedians' material, it would have another never-ending source of "butthurt".
So, basically, once people started linking even the most bland of offensive jokery, other people started getting smart to the whole thing, and actually would try and debate on SRS, saying things like "hey, that joke isn't really THAT bad, what gives?". Some of the people who would argue were less than eloquent, so I can understand some of the SRS backlash to that, but basically, they simply got tired of arguing. They claim that they're not really "offended", but that some of these things can actually cause harm to the people joked against, if there's a target to the joke (fat people, minorities, etc). [The brains behind the operation.](
Once they decided that they weren't going to debate any of the offensiveness of anything they linked with anyone, then the circlejerking started. It's basically a mentality of, "if you aren't offended by what i'm offended by, then you just don't get it you cis neckbeard white privileged trash". This results in them responding with random BS, and then saying "oh, we're not going to debate you", etc. The whole thing is supposed to be a joke? It's confusing as hell.
If it's a joke, why can't you TAKE a joke? Why bring something up as "serious" and be offended by it, and then basically act aloof and circlejerk up the threads? They act like they want to take reddit to task over what they say, but then they don't really have salient points...it's like if 4chan and somethingawful started a feminist debate club. 
I stay subscribed, only to watch the downward spiral of an odd group of individuals. Maybe it's one massive trolling effort to egg people on and troll them, maybe it's a bunch of "butthurt" people who can't use logic, or maybe it's literally a militant feminist hangout to try and "get back" at those making jokes at their expense by making their own in-jokes back at them. I don't really have a problem with them per se, but they obviously can't be taken seriously, even if their original mission was to be serious and point out what popular comments were blatantly prejudicial. The tone taken by their posters undermines their goal.
My theory (preface: possibly a joke)? They're all actually "white cis neckbeard males" in some sort of ultra-apologetic feminist circlejerk where they can practice white knighting in an accepted environment (read: mostly male). 
 who cares, they're so takei.
With the low tier stuff on the German side far too diverse(e.g 3 tier 6 meds that are very different from each other) I'll concentrate on where they really start characterizing themselves (Tier 7+).
German mediums are the most heavy like of mediums they turn their turrets/hulls slowly,take longer to stop and reverse and all of them are snipers (0.28-0.3 acc.) since the point of a medium is to scout in CW you don't see them much there. 
Their heavies(except the Tiger (H), Ausf A) are also the most heavy like , having the best front armour(turret armour is a bit iffy though on everything without the Henschel turm) and the slowest speed. They also have ,except for the E-100, access to the most accurate guns in their tier although by tier 9 this is no longer as large an advantage.
*Note all German tanks at those tiers can turn in place.
Soviet mediums have a playstyle that's all over the place  as the T-34 can be used for everything but peek a boo fighting in heavy cover which the T-34-85/T-43 excel at, T-44/T-54 changes this up as they are both the most light like of mediums with the fastest acceleration lending themselves to flying around flanking enemy heavies in wolf packs.
Soviet heavies can be classed into two groups, which after the revision will have 2 definite lines for each. The mobile heavies containing the KV-1S, IS, IS-3, IS-7 and the traditional heavies with the KV, KV-3, IS-4. The mobile heavies often have less armour than their German counterparts but the highest top speed among their peers. The slower ones often do best exposing quite a bit of side armour (front and side of the IS-4 and KV have the exact same values)
*Note all Soviet Heavies and the T-34-85/T-43 have the slowest aim times in their class and no Med/Heavy of their's can turn in place.
US tanks almost always have the best moving accuracy, best gun depression and are also often agile. They also have the largest mantlets(M4A3E2 and Tiers 7+) with which they utilize in hull down positions to render them partially invulnerable although by tier 9 their turret armour is no longer the best. The only medium they have with frontal armour is the M4A3E2 the rest and also the T34/T30 are usually behind their peers in this regard.
*Note unlike the other nationalities, where it is only available at Tier 8+, the Vertical stabilizer is available on the Chaffe and at Tier 6 onwards .
TDs and SPGs are best described individually.

No idea why this is being downvoted.
At anywhere at or above diamond, Protoss simply can't do anything against Zerg to stay on equal footing besides a FFE, besides doing an all-in off of one base. 
3 gate expands are worthless and outdated due to their inability to pressure, so the Zerg can just throw up spines and drone to whatever they want
1 and 2 gate expands are reliant on few forcefields to close up space, so the only maps that they work are on closed natural maps such as Shattered Temple. Maps like Xel Naga Caverns and the far left spawn on Metalopolis are technically POSSIBLE to do, but it's -way- harder to defend any Zerg all-in with these maps than, I would argue, any other race matchup in the game.
This guy is right and the fact that he was at -1 when I got here was either naive or ignorant.
Arid Plateau is a terrible map for many reasons. Protoss players are not allowed to FFE because the natural is really hard to defend. You have two HUGE opennings which makes zergling runbys or even early game roach aggression very viable without much damage done to the zerg player. So you're bound to stay on one base whereas the zerg can easily fast expand to their liking. However even if you manage to secure your natural, your next question would be "Where am I going to take my third?" The one close to me which is extremely wide open making surrounds a lot easier for zerg players or you can take the far away expansion, which consist of back door rocks and a huge gap between your natural and the third. It's a pain to wall off the those areas as a Protoss player because you're pretty much investing most of your money on static defense and not investing your money in increasing your mobile army. 
The map is extremely open and prone to mobile strategies and tatics, such as mutalisk harass and drops, even nydus worms would do sufficent amount of damage to a protoss player if they aren't careful. 
Arid Plateau is a very wide and open map which zerg players can fully expliot their mobility and deny any bases from going up. Zerg players can expand freely as the protoss players sufficate on one or two bases.
Just to clarify, my problem may be invalid bit in terms of your fear of vomiting, is it the act or the consequences? I generally **hate** being nauseous and *triple hate* throwing up because it makes breathing difficult. I've had a number of panic attacks before and I suffer from stress and dysthymia so I hate thinking about not being able to breath. However, I don't let these things get to me, I haven't had a large panic attack since high school. But more recently as I get older I am just *sick of getting sick*. I contribute the panic attacks/bad breathing to my great dislike of vomiting.
In New Zealand we have Mylanta which tastes like sweet chalk and helps settle the stomach, and you must be familiar with Uno? I think that's what it's called, which you put in water and drink straight away. So I took both of these and sat in the bathroom at home for 45 minutes until I got over it. Hated every second of it but am glad I didn't throw up.
*** If you're not bothered reading, why exactly do you hate/fear vomiting?.
Throwaway account time.
I too have Agoraphobia, however I have the rarer kind.
Agoraphobia without history of panic disorder
I don't have panic attacks, but I am incredibly afraid of going outside. I am in my room almost all the time now. I spend almost 24/7 in my room with maybe 1 trip to the store a month. Going to the store scares the shit out of me.
Agoraphobia is such an awkward disorder, I hate telling people I am on disability. I feel ashamed of it, I feel ashamed of not having a job too. It also sucks realizing I probably will never have a relationship with a female because of this, but as the years go by I've grown to accept this. I'm in my twenties now, I'm not getting any younger. I had a really hard time going to school when I was younger, I skipped school intentionally due to fear.
Theres a lot more I could write but I'm about to go to sleep. I too have other problems I suffer from that contribute to my agoraphobia.
 I know that feel ;_;
Hey there!  I have (had) agoraphobia with panic disorder and OCD (purely obsessional variety, no compulsions) since I was very young.  The OCD came first, started when I was about seven.  I remember summers home from school being an absolute nightmare for me and my mom, she was always trying to 'distract me' from my bad thoughts.  
My first episode of agoraphobia happened when I was 21--was in the shower and just had this awful choking fear.  I went to a psychiatrist at the time who wanted me on benzos and Elavil (this was a while ago) but I decided I'd self medicate with booze instead.  It finally came to a head when I was about 26, living in Brooklyn, unable to even leave my apartment to go to the store, let alone go out with friends.  
I was really convinced that I would be dead if I did go out, or go insane.  Or that if I went out something would happen to my boyfriend at the time--who is now my husband.  :)  My throat would seize up, I would get these really awful feelings in my arms and legs, I always thought I had clots because of the feelings, my heart would pound, I would sweat like crazy.  Basically just believed I was dying the entire time.  I also had it so bad that a normal panic attack which for most lasts about 15-20 minutes would last for about 50-60 for me.  
That period was rough in that it lasted about nine months, but we got through it.  I was super lucky to have his support.  I don't know if I could have done it alone.  I was also lucky in that a lot of my friends were in the film industry and I was able to get jobs through them working as a script analyst, which allowed me to work from home.
I was very brutally honest about it with my friends and family and myself.  People knew that if they wanted to see me, for a little while, at least, it was better if they came to our place.  I went through a series of psychiatrists--some of whom were good and some of whom were really nothing more than pill pushers and finally found that the best pill for me personally--though many people will tell you it's horrible and addictive and will destroy your life, was valium.  The valium allowed me then (and still allows me) to leave the house, go out with my friends, have a life.  It's a safety bubble that makes the world a lot less scary.  I can even go to Disneyland without any symptoms.  I have an annual passport.  :D   
After I got stabilized, I was able to get a great, very traditional psychotherapist who I spoke to three times a week--over the phone, haha!  She helped me probably as much as the valium does.  This is going to sound stupid but a lot of what we worked on was building a self-image where I felt like I had extra protection.  Though I'm not blonde and I could never wear what she does I got really fixated on Emma Frost from the X-Men because she can turn into diamond, and it's strong and not permeable and whatever--anyhow, when I'm having a panic attack I still try to think of myself as a diamond.  Don't know why, but it helps.
Anyhow, I'm older now and I still battle with it.  It waxes and wanes.  Stress is a big factor.  You have to stay on top of your stress.  Some days it's almost as bad as when I first got it.  Some days it's almost non-existent.  With support and meds and good shrinks, your life is going to be a good one.   I just wanted to give you and anyone else reading this thread some words of support.   You sound like you're on the right road.   Lots of positive thoughts coming your way, be good to yourself.
Had it all my life, life can still end up being better than you ever imagined, hang in there.
I did apologize a little, pride keeps me from going the whole way :P
I do feel for you, it was unfair for me to vent on you.  The good news is that you probably loaded up on a ton of karma since this thread hit frontpage..
While I was writing the last reply I took to time to read the whole thread over and I know what you mean concerning the vitriol.  I realize the disorder is complicated and such issues tend to run together.  Learning more of your background also makes it more difficult to hold a hard line on who is deserving of what and what constitutes a disability.  i.e. Person A may have a more serious condition but is able to manage it; while Person B has more difficulty managing their condition and is unable to function normally.
It might just be me, but I was raised to believe that responsibility for any person rests solely on them-self and their family.. as long as the family is doing it right.. maybe part of my problem is that I had too easy a time of it.  I grew up with Aspergers (like everyone else between here and 4chan apparently) and forced myself to 'normalize' as my second child psych called it (I also never took my meds, didn't like the way they effected my mood etc. Think I saw you reference that too) and now there is no record of it so far as the government is concerned.. wouldn't have been allowed into the service otherwise.  The TBI is a little more complicated, but at least now when I don't want people to touch me I can claim it's PTSD related and nobody rolls their eyes :D (I do not believe I have PTSD, or even that it's a real thing, my brother hotly disagrees).  I don't believe I NEED benefits though.  I feel I am owed the hiring preference and my job (in a training company) pressures me often because there are myriad benefits to employing disabled veterans as well the preference being of obvious benefit to me when I finish that ever elusive BA degree and go back into federal service.  I've never felt a victim nor been in such straits I couldn't support myself or meet my obligations.  I think this makes it difficult for me to fully empathize.
So again, my apologies.  I saw the OP and jumped the gun trying to be snarky.  Also it's like 0200 here, shouldn't you be with the family/fiance'? (I'm flattered though :blush:) If you're really lonely enough to be on reddit right now let's have a drink.  :D
  Not everyone can be held to the same standard, if anything the level of difficulty is more relevant that the category of the affliction/disorder.  I hope things pan out well for you, let's drink.
Not anger at you specifically, irritation at a situation and system that you are a client member of.  
First I'm sorry for your father's COPD.  A close friend had burn scars in his lungs and suffered similar symptoms.  I know what it's like fighting the VA, but it's different when the injury is obvious and demonstrable, thus easier to prove legally.  Infrequent redouts and random loss of spatial awareness are more difficult to prove than hearing loss or internal injuries that can be quantified with x-rays and stethoscopes.  
I apologize, I've really taken out more of my frustration on you than I meant to, the internet makes that easy.  However I can't understand how you can feel entitled to what you are receiving.  While you may technically be eligible, is it right to take it?  Do you truly believe that the program was meant to provide for long term care of a person with an anxiety disorder (correct me if I am wrong, I think it's an anxiety disorder but am not a mental health professional)?  I feel like instead of a stipend, medication, and a psychiatrist; you could be helped by a seminar on breathing exercises and stress mitigation.  Don't get me wrong; I absolutely believe that if it's a problem you deserve help as a human being.  But if it isn't something you can get through on your own, the external help should still be limited.  The old maxim about teaching people to fish comes to mind.  
  There are folks out in the world getting by with far greater and more real problems and you're receiving financial support for an condition that can qualify as a disease only in the first world.
PS. Merry Christmas to you as well.  
The ad hominem is in attaching negative labels to your detractors.  But I think we have enough substance here that semantics can be partially ignored or at least left on the wayside.
Taxation and Tithing are not the same and do not feed into the same pot, so to speak.  Monks are private individuals who dedicate their lives to their religion and are in return supported by said institution while convicts are persons who fail to respect the boundaries set by society and are incarcerated with the hope of reformation or at least removal from the public engine at the expense of the state.
There is a great deal of debate over what the causes of the civil war were; but I believe above all others the idea that it was fought over slavery is simplistic and should stay pre-8th grade.  It was a war/insurrection fought over the distribution of power between the states and the  Union itself based on two interpretations of the 9th-10th Amendments.
At the end of the day, direction is based on self motivation.  Giving a person who does not have any impetus to work free food, housing, and medical care will not encourage them to pursue a goal.  FYSA I have never been a slave nor truly homeless (I had friends who gave me places to stay), but I know what it's like to be so hungry I couldn't sleep.  It's not fun, but it was never anyone's fault but my own and I damn well fixed it.  Bearing in mind the issues I was working through at the time, I believe anyone is capable of the same.. largely because I actually believe in equality as opposed to paying lip-service to it and demanding that the odds be fixed one way of the other. 
Getting "fish to mouth" (so to speak) is ultimately the responsibility of the person.  I feel you are taking a parable too literally here, so in kind, I respond with;  whose responsibility is it to ingest nutrition?
Jesus is a probably real figure who is prominent in a handful of possibly, partially true stories.  I usually avoid using religious texts as references because they often offer contradictory snippets of wisdom and/or allow for too broad of an interpretation for simple phrases.  In this case however;
 Ex.
 "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”  -Thessalonians, 3:10
"Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 5 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness."
-Romans 4:4-4:5
Luke 18:9 might also warrant reading for you.
.
.
I would disagree that all persons want to work.  I believe people want to take the path of least resistance, like everything else in the universe.  So is it not better to give a man the tools to survive than to support him at your own cost?  If the latter, why?  Why the hell should I/you?  But this is getting philosophical and away from the object question so far (Who gets what and why?) at least as I see it; so maybe we should decide whether to shift gears to get back on track.
The economy was made by society in it's search to obtain certain resources more easily.  Caveman A wants leather but is only good at growing corn so he trades Caveman B who is good at tanning a quantity of corn for a quantity of leather.  In modern days, society is defined by several factors, one of which is economics, and people are expected to fit the mold by following the rules in order to reap the benefits.  So.. play the game to win the prize.  If you don't want to play or play by the rules, why on earth should you be rewarded?
Not wanting to help and not feeling an obligation to help are different animals.  Person A feels no particular obligation to assisting their neighbors with _______.  You initial argument would hold that person A has no empathy and is essentially a Nazi.  
I don't see the government as 'failing' in said way.  Primarily because I don't believe it is the government's responsibility to provide the realization of the American dream.  The opportunity is there if one would only take it.  Kids in the streets?  You must be referring to the "occupy" movement.  I am at a loss for words.  When I think of the 'occupiers' I think of visiting the city last October for a Deadmau5 show in Yonkers and meeting such bright and charming individuals that their only explanation of "why?" was because they felt somebody 'should' help them with their debt, tuition, rent, etc. for no articulate reason.  Because.. " Like.. bro, people have SO much money bro".  while the federal gov't has the right to tax, how much do they have the right to tax?  This is a subjective question.  The socialist (or fascist) would say they can tax everything while a moderate capitalist would say they have a right to tax something, so long as it's not debilitating.  Taxes on individuals in the US are borderline debilitating for many in the top two brackets who are not billionaires but still make over $150-250k.   
There is a system, imperfect as it is, for assisting veterans.  An entire executive department in fact.  No it is not perfect, but it's a shit hell of a lot better than anybody else's.  Further, while there may be homeless and empty homes... those empty homes belong to someone.  Either a person, a bank, or a developer, the property is.... property!  The owners did not invest in said property so they could house squatters.  They did it to make some money.  
I agree that our legislators and chief exec(s) did and are messing up, but the solution is not to do a blanket free home/medical giveaway for the have-nots.  The agreement between society and government is that the society will respect the authority of the government if the government respects the rights of society.  In the US, one of those rights is property.  As for the jobless... I can name 5 organizations who are ALWAYS hiring anybody between the ages of 18-37 (waivers available) as both civil servants and civilians at all times.  These organizations will also not only provide training and skills that can apply in private fields but also will grant a hiring preference in the public sector.  I think you know what I am alluding to.
  It's the responsibility of a man to alter his circumstances.  
P.S. I am half asleep and getting tired of regurgitating arguments from my last two posts so I am posting this without proofreading (at my peril, I know), so expect an edit for clarification.  I'd appreciate getting until 1300EST to edit before a response is posted.
I wrote up a piece about this a few months back, but I would like to reiterate a few things: 
They do not care about the well-being of our beloved sport, College Football. They do not care about the well-being of other sports - say, College Basketball, or the MLB, or the NBA, or any of them. 
That company does not care about care about the well-being of their "lesser" journalists. You'll note that when [Craig James]( (yeah, the hooker guy) was up against one of their less favored children and it kinda looked like they had to choose... well, here's [why Bruce Feldman no longer works for them]( 
Journalistic integrity? Pfft, why bother? Just say you got your information from a "source", problem solved. Its not their fault if the information on their front page is wrong - its the "source's". And when they run into a problem area where they might be conflicted? They just bury their heads and move on - this is *heavily* rumored to be why [Pat Forde left]( I will note that this is only rumored, and has not been openly stated. 
Remember when Texas A&amp;M (if you're on a phone or have flair missing, A&amp;M is my school flair) was having such of a bitch of a time moving to the SEC? And it seemed like ESPN was one of the last places you could go to get accurate information on Conference Realignment? Well, [depending on who you ask, there's a pretty good reason for that]( Turns out trying to create a monopoly on sports coverage can have dizzying legal implications.
ESPN *used to be* one of the best things to happen to sports. They were clever, witty, and informational. They summarized the sports world in quick twenty minute bites before work, or between class, or after you got home and were just waiting for The West Wing to come on. 
But somewhere, they stopped reporting stories and started making stories. At some point, they became Jim Rome, Skip Bayless, and Lou Holtz. Yeah, they might be entertaining - but they're certainly not what I would think of as the best parts of sorts. 
ESPN's interest is no longer to tell you what's going on - it's to sell you what's going on.
**ESPN is the goddamn devil.**
The first point is that CO2 absorbs in a different part of the spectrum than H2O, as pointed out by [not_wrong](  Additionally, while there is an order of magnitude less CO2 in the atmosphere compared to H2O (0.039% of the atmosphere is CO2, 0.4% is H2O), the CO2 absorption band is much more effective at blocking infrared light than H2O, so that the greenhouse effect from CO2 is ~30 Wm-2, while H2O is ~60Wm-2.  You can play with an atmospheric absorption simulator [here](
The right way to think of the heat balance of the climate is as a [stock-and-flow]( problem; the Earth's surface absorbs heat from the Sun, and radiates heat away via infrared radiation.  If the Earth absorbs more heat than it radiates away, the temperature increases until the Earth is radiating enough heat to balance the incoming solar radiation.  Adding CO2 to the atmosphere blocks some of the outgoing infrared radiation, so the Earth warms up.
Since most of the Earth's surface is water, and water has such a large heat capacity compared to land, the extra trapped heat mostly goes into increasing the ocean temperature.  This is a huge amount of water with an immense thermal inertia, so that when you add CO2 to the atmosphere, it takes about 50 years for enough heat to be absorbed by the ocean to increase the sea surface temperature enough to restore radiative equilibrium.  The ocean acts as a huge buffer to temperature change, but it doesn't prevent the changes from happening, it just slows them down.
As the ocean warms, more evaporation occurs, increasing atmosphere temperature and H2O content.  However, this just makes the problem *worse*, because H2O is a greenhouse gas and so increasing atmospheric H2O prevents more heat from escaping the Earth's surface.  This positive feedback *enhances* the heat trapping effects of CO2.
At the same time, increasing atmospheric H2O changes the amount and height of the Earth's cloud cover, and this is where we hit the cutting edge climate science.  Satellite and model simulation data indicates that increasing the Earth's temperature will probably decrease average cloud cover, and increase average cloud height, which means this feedback will also *enhance* the effects of CO2.
So!  Atmospheric water vapour makes global warming worse, while the ocean's thermal inertial buffers, but does not prevent, the Earth's temperature change.
I prefer the history/historical fashion/historical paintings/photo ones the most, I find them to quite interesting. With a couple of cute animal ones thrown in for when I need a pick-me-up or when my brain has turned to mush due to information overload. 
**a) depends what you are after b) mostly crap but with a few gems.**
Disagreed. Seldom at best do I get killed by the G3, M16, or L85 close range. Their rate of fire is not high enough in close quarters to keep up with say the stopping power of the FAMAS. The reason the AEK is normally deemed statistically better than the F200 is because of it's slightly higher rate of fire; meaning that it's actual DPS output is higher because they both have the same damage rating of 17 minimum and 25 maximum. The rate of fire of the M16, G3, or L85 pails in comparison to the FAMAS, F2000, and the AEK. The cases in which these guns differ is on a circumstantial basis. There are a few reviews on youtube about the actual quality of the L85, and it's consistently stated that the gun absolutely dominates medium to long range, but the rate of fire stops it from being that effect in CQB. Now since the nerf of the F2000, I've definitely noticed a drop in its usage. But before then? That was almost every assault's gun of choice. F2000 + IRNV + Foregrip = dominated. The amount of times I recall being frustrated by the literal annihilation that gun carried when people used it was phenomenal. I forgot where I was going with this in general until just now.
tl;dr
G3, M16, L85 are not better than the AEK, FAMAS, or F2000. Just depends on the situation. They are better for different circumstances.
For the same reason you can get a Heineken in the Netherlands for €.99 while the same beer costs substantially more in the United States (and no, that's not just differences in manufacturing or shipping costs - the margins are higher).
You live in a market that is shown to be responsive to higher prices. Ideally, price and volume factor together parabolically to create a profit graph with a vertex - price too low and you're missing potential sales dollars, price too high and you move too few units. If $100 USD is that sweet spot for your region, you can hardly blame a company for sticking to it. They have shareholders.
Quite frankly, if you don't like the options you're presented with, stop buying video games. Until you do, you're just supporting their market research data.
 it's not extortion; it's business.
I agree with you completely.  It took a massive and risky experiment (Steam) to even begin to lead things in a more sensible direction.  There were earlier efforts but Steam arrived at the right time with the right product.  No entrenched publisher was willing to set such a potentially-dangerous precedent, so nothing has happened.  OnLive might be another major player in the future.
Netflix is another example, and may prove to be something even more momentous if their original content programming is successful, such as with the new season of Arrested Development they're funding.
I'd cite iTunes as another example of a paradigm shift except that, while it's better for consumers, it's still terrible for content creators.  The move from physical to digital was made, but none of the savings has been passed on and as such there are still the same gatekeepers.  Their one-purchase, one-download system is also a *complete piece of shit*, but that's the fault of publishers more than Apple.  Their app store however has been an unqualified success.
It will take a completely new player in the music market to finally create a new correlation between quality, availability, and profitability for the actual music content creators.  The problem is that there's no delivery mechanism.  Sirius Satellite Radio or Pandora (and similar services) might have a chance but they don't have the vertical integration to provide an all-in-one solution.
Youtube might also be able to give smaller production companies a chance to get their start if their own original programming is a success, but their history of botching product launches by providing the product first and the quality second is likely to hinder them.
The trend here is that **these are all companies that weren't publishers previously** and so they are able to see the reality of the situation, unclouded by the fear of change.  Another trend is that they've found ways to make DRM something positive rather than negative.  Steam lets me play anything I want, anywhere I want, anytime I want, for a lower price which reflects the nonexistent manufacturing and delivery costs.  This is **better than the original product**.  Contrast this with UltraViolet/Origin/etc, the big studios' ~~debacle~~ solution to digital distribution, which is DRM first, profit second, customer third.
&gt; the internet, that has been here since a couple decades, and it's here to stay.
Is it?  SOPA, Protect IP, and future bills of the same type threaten to effectively destroy the internet - and this is at a time when 2/3 of the US political system is supposedly "liberal".  Also, the structure and functionality of the internet has been fundamentally changing and improving since it was first made into a consumer product; the internet today isn't the internet 5 years ago.  Bandwidth is still far too expensive for OnLive, Netflix, and similar businesses to be economical in many places.  Speed and reliable availability also range from being beyond optimal to being almost unusable, even within the USA where it was invented.

There are two ways I think this should be seen:
1. If the life goal of all is just to be happy, and that just by achieving relationships - then your country and this planet will be pretty damned. Countries with cultures that value relationships much (especially those that focus on traditional family-relationships) are usually the ones with high corruption and cronyism. But that is not my main point. My point is: If everybody just strives to be happy and just cares about the relationships - the people in their immediate circle - none will do good for society, environment or the like. Of course it won't come to this extreme, but a culture focused solely (!) on happiness is a selfish culture. Yes, happiness is happy, we shouldn't slave away in a factory just because it's good for the greater good, but if all just care about themselves and maybe their close ones, then humanity is just going downhill from here.
2.  Is that all there is to life than feeling good about it? I know that is a bad argument but if you read any of the old books with advice on how to live a good life - say, any up till 1950 - you will barely find much about being happy or satisfied. Those are the fads of our time, that the prime ideal is to be happy. I think that's a sad state, if you say "all I want from life is good relationships". Yes, of course they make you feel good. But (a) they won't be good if the rest of your life is not good (e.g. if you have a job that makes you feel miserable it is unlikely that you will be able to maintain healthy relationships; and if you are unemployed you are likely to feel pretty down about that too) and (b) maybe there is something more than "feeling good" or "happy"? Yay, feeling happy is great, but is that all? If you believe old books they barely even mention it. They speak about doing good for your community, helping others, making a change in the world. Maybe not everybody will reach those goals, but I would be devastated if all there was to life was striving for happiness and that would just mean having relationships. If that was the life motto in the past few good things would have happened in the world.
***: I think there is a misguided modern happiness cult. Yes, happiness is important, but if striving for happiness is everybody's goal, then neither has our species a chance of a future, nor will anyone actually achieve happiness.

(copied to all the replies :) )
Why would that be the case? You think caring about one's own feelings and maybe those of the few people around you will make "the world" better?

(except the first sentence copied from another reply I gave)
Really depends what you do.. When I started working at 16, I started off at a movie theater, and I annoyed the crap out if the manager seeing if any positions were opened every week, when I left that job, I started working at an insurance agency (which my sister worked there do that helped me get my foot in the door), when I left there and moved to another state I used a temp agency to help find me a new job and they found a position for me at another insurance agency.. When I moved to a new state, which I knew I was going to be there for a short time, I got 2 jobs (1 in retail and the other in grocery) just to have some money come in.. And now I moved one more time and I'm going to be here for at least 3 years so I'm going back to school to learn a whole new trade in being a dental assistant..  Each job that I left(except the 2 recent ones), I always got promoted and when I was leaving they always were sad to see me go and always tried to get me to stay because I proved myself to them that I was worth keeping around.. And if I was to stay at the 2 most recent jobs, I would have been promoted as well but I turned the promotions down because I knew I'd be leaving.. 

The point of my post is just that you don't always need connections to land a good job, sometimes you gotta start off at the bottom and work your way up by proving you are worth having in that business. 
Just so you know... the paragard has a nickel core. So if you are allergic to nickel you could have problems. My problems didn't start until after I'd had it for two years. Then suddenly I started having unexplained neck swelling, itching and rashes, horrible painful periods, weight gain (later found out to be swelling), feeling like I had the flu all the time and needing to sleep 18+ hours a day. The doctors couldn't figure out what was up and I couldn't keep living like this while trying to take care of my two toddlers. Luckily someone on the motheringdotcom forums mentioned that the paragard has a nickel core. I called the company and sure enough... it does. I ended up having to beg the gyn to take it out and when she finally did it came out encased in a giant ball of flesh. All the symptoms went away within 2 weeks. My regular doctor thinks that if it would have been left in I would have eventually had an anaphylaxic episode and died. For added fun I can no longer wear my grandmothers copper jewelry without getting a horrible rash. I hope that is not a long term thing.
** Be very careful if you have trouble with nickel**
Just my two cents, that there's really no hurry. The birth control methods available can be hassle free and, depending on your beliefs, there are morning-after options as well. 
If you do feel like it has to be a permanent surgery, *right NOW!*, then I definitely advise waiting. Try to take a step back and think about why it's so urgent? Why does it need to be permanent, and why right now?
I don't know you and I apologize if this is too presumptuous, but think about whether or not you trust yourself. Do you fear that if you don't do this now while you're 'in the middle of it', you might make a mistake later? Do you think you might be pressured into having a child you don't want unless it's physically impossible to have one? Is outside pressure or dismissal of your opinion making you need to confirm them permanently to validate them? Those are all issues that are terrible reasons to have the surgery, so try to make 100% sure those are not the reasons for your urgency. The choice should be about *your feelings* and what you want to do with *your body*. A friend of mine went through hell with complications from a fairly simple surgery in this area (bc of ectopic pregnancy), so trust me you don't want to make it lightly or for the wrong reasons.
That said, nothing wrong with not wanting more kids. I never wanted kids at all, nothing against them, just absolutely didn't want one. Had a lot of fights in a previous relationship for that reason and today I'm glad I stood by my decision. Then at 28 I started dating my current husband and something in my body just said "we're having this man's baby. Get with it or GTFO" and today I'm 30 and 5 months pregnant, something my friends are still completely shocked at. I didn't "see the light" or start hearing the clock ticking or anything. I just wanted to have *this* baby with *this* person. 
Sounds weird, but I wanted to share it as an example of how sometimes things change in the strangest way, even if it seems unthinkable for most of your life. It doesn't invalidate one's previous feelings at all. If I had never met my husband, I would probably live out my life childless and be perfectly happy about it. If you feel not having more kids is the right choice for you, then it probably is. But you can make that choice for the rest of your life without cutting off the possibility of changing your mind.
- not wanting more kids is perfectly OK. Waiting until 30 is a very good idea, though, because having a choice is always good, even if you never want to use it.
Also, sorry if I was being presumptuous, it's just something I had to deal with myself with my 'don't want kids' stance through most of my life.
You mean I could have whored out my tripod timer shot proposal for heaps of karma!?! No thanks, but I will show that her engagement ring does look like a piece of the triforce. 
 my Fiance has a triforce engagement ring. 
I had this problem as well. Have you dropped it and had it repaired ever? I don't know if that was the culprit for me. A family who was hosting me in another state opened their trunk and out went my backpack smack on the concrete. Apple repaired it and sent it back. It was quite a while until I had any issues though.
I'd be using a regular program and boom, frozen, forced to restart. It would even go as far as freezing the moment I log in.
I called Apple and they had me go through a series of tests and repairs to fix it. However, we were fixing two issues here. My wireless would shut off. The Airport card would turn off and not turn back on until I restarted it. As a result, I had it "repaired" and sent back. The issue persisted, however, somewhere in the mix, the freezing stopped. Here's what I remember them doing:
1. Disk Utility (verifying the hard drive and repairing the hard drive) using the system disc so that you can repair it without using the hard drive itself
2. They had me time machine back it up, reinstall the OS, and put everything back. The freezing may have stopped here, I'm not sure.
3. The Apple rep continued to work with me by telling me to partition the hard drive and install a fresh unmodified install of OS X. All issues persisted, even the freezing. (so I don't think the freezing stopped actually)
4. They replaced my motherboard, my power socket, and my Airport card. Again, I still have no idea if the freezing stopped at this point but I do know my WiFi issue did not stop.
5. I had to send it off to some out-of-state authorized apple repair place to ensure there is an unknown issue. They again replaced all hardware pretty much.
6. I lost my case ID at this point but my issues remained. I called them again and told the man who answered that we were working on getting my computer replaced. He probably got the case ID by finding my serial number and past calls. In about 10 minutes I had a shipping number and a brand new Macbook Pro on it's way to my house (fully updated).  
Call Apple and have them run through their checklist. If they fix it, good, if they don't - ask about a replacement.
Best of luck mate! I had the exact model as you did so we may have had a corrupt line :-( But right now, I'm writing to you on the newest Macbook Pro :D
Yes, the toxins produced from smoking pot are bad for you. However, one bowl a day is still a low amount of smoke overall to consume, compared to,say, a pack a day smoker. 
This is exactly why vaporizers were invented. I would post a link but I'm on my phone. I have a Magic Flight Launch Box (MFLB) and love it. 
google "weed vaporizer."
Well, where I got it, it was only like 7 bucks, so I bought it just to see. 
It consists of a few "interviews" which are good for a quick laugh, a few pictures and maps I didn't care about, and 3 short stories, all of which are canon. 
I wont tell you what the stories entail, but they do explain certain things in the series that I definitely noticed my first time reading it (I read the series without the demigod files the first time). Such as this random wingless golden dragon that everyone already seemed to know (Festus). Why Hades showed up to the final battle of TLO with a random sword (and not the staff he is portrayed with in mythology) and various other things. But none of these things are essential to understanding the story. All three of the stories take place between books 4 and 5, so no matter what you decide you have some time. 
 It is technically canon but it is not essential. If you can get it cheep definitely go for it. If not, don't bother. 
Not big on the whole, asking people for stuff thing, but my younger brother (16) had a daughter a year ago, my dad has M.S. (can't work) and it's myself and my mother supporting my family plus my friend who got kicked out of his parent's house because he's gay.
My brother's friend's 360 was broken in an accident (that was half my bros fault) so he gave ours to his friend without even asking me.
TL;DR
I miss my 360 and even though I jointly owned it, it was given away without asking me.
Even if you don't end up choosing me to give it to, you're doing an awesome thing and I hope whomever gets it is very happy with it. =)  Enjoy your upvote sah!
It used to be that valve would release weapons, some would be well designed, and some would have flaws. Then they would fix the flaws. Now, it kind of seems like they don't want to fix the flaws (GRU+sandvich making the heavy a godlike beast) or even that the flaws are intentional (Enforcer and tomislav making their respective classes easier AND more powerful, so that new F2P players can play these classes successfully) I mean, it's been six months since the enforcer came out, and there are almost no experienced players saying that it's balanced, fun, or anything but a stupid buff in the wrong direction, but Valve hasn't said or done anything to it, so I'm assuming they like it the way it is. With some of the new weapons from the most recent update also having severe balance problems that make the game less fun, I hope Valve is still interested in a well designed game, but a part of me worries that might not be their top priority.
 It's not going downhill...yet.
I was slapped by a female acquaintance (friend of a friend) when I was in 8th grade.  I slapped her back.  We both were suspended for one week (it was the last week of the school year).

I used to stay away from companions since the first time I had to use one in Missing in Action, the guy ruined all of my sneak attacks by rushing into battle. Eventually, though, I decided to pick up Kharjo as a companion because kitty, and because screw J'zargo. He fares a lot better as a sneaking companion. He can actually sneak decently and he's good with a bow so he doesn't ruin sneak attacks as much. When he does rush into battle he absorbs hits with his heavy armour while I stay back and support him with my bow, usually while remaining hidden. It may be useful for you to get a companion that's built to be sneaky, like the Dark Brotherhood Initiate or Aela the Huntress. Then again, I've never actually done a quest with Mercer Fey, so that may not be the source of the problem.

You're being pretty wishy-washy with your advice. In the original post you said shoot in RAW+JPG but here you're saying RAW will be all but worthless for someone new to photography. And while I agree with that last notion, I don't agree with the original notion of RAW+JPEG for both the reasons that you brought up against shooting in just RAW and for the simple fact that people who shoot in that mode will be doing it with the deliberate intention of needing both a RAW and a JPEG not because they're learning the ropes. More likely than not someone who takes your advice will shoot in RAW+JPEG and for awhile and figure out that it really isn't helping them at all, and switch to just JPEG. I think when they're ready to edit RAW they'll shoot in just RAW and when they aren't or don't want to they won't. The middle step seems more to highlight the flaws of either format since you obviously won't be using both. Secondly you said you found that slowing down has helped you to understand other aspects of photography, but here you say that slowing down to just shooting in manual will scare people off. I don't think that's true. I think it's great to learn it. In fact I know people that buy a DSLR become okay with automatic values and after having never learned to shoot in manual, which, let's be honest, isn't that difficult and saying new people can't do it is likely seriously underestimating them, they just shoot in automatic all the time and end up with the too common problem of having irreparably flawed images. The truth is you know more about what the lens will see than your camera does, it makes a usually good guess, but anytime someone stands next to a window or away from a sunset or what have you, you can get some pretty shitty results. Take it from me, captain of the run-on sentence. In all seriousness though arguing about this is a bit like arguing whether or not you should let your child chose to believe in god or whether you should cram your religion or atheism down their throats. I think they should be able to chose, I think your first rule was really the bottom line and instead of arguing about what new photographers "ought" to do we should trust in their ability to figure things out on their own. Obviously, however, additional tips can't hurt, but I believe shooting in manual is a means for figuring things out more than it is a hindrance in that process. It might slow them down at first, but like you said, that will give them a chance to evaluate the shot all the better. Eventually they'll be able to understand pretty quickly as soon as they walk in the room what settings to use before they even bring the camera up to their face. Again, just as any of us can accurately do, I'm only speaking from personal experience. I think I'm coming along okay, and I sternly believe I owe a lot of that to using manual early on. I think that's the distinction. Using manual is a developmental practice. It's a didactic experience. Using RAW is an only eventually helpful thing, there's a tipping point with it, you go from not needing it, to needing it without middle ground. By the time you know how to edit in RAW you can decide for yourself whether to shoot in RAW or JPEG. Like no one needs to have RAW files of their family opening Christmas presents. If the picture could have looked slightly better, oh well, my aunts and uncles on facebook aren't going to notice or care, and the memory will be preserved all the same. For that matter shooting in RAW is a tool, and bringing your hammer with you every time you go to change a light bulb is just a heavy waste. Shooting in manual, on the other hand, is a process not an simple yes/no option. The more you use it the better you use it, and the more you understand about how your camera functions. Please excuse my wordiness. And my dear aunt Sally.     
We don't have the same opinions, but that's okay. RAW= Bad for beginners. Manual= Good for beginners. 
It's a three way toss up. Freshman year in college I was having sex with my bf and despite having left a note on the door, his drunk roommate throws the door open. Along with him was the entire 3rd floor (pretty much half of our football team) standing there staring at me sitting cowgirl, boobs initially bouncing. (I stopped pretty quickly). The second was during the summer after my sophomore year in college. My husband (at the time bf) was over visiting me and we decided we needed a bit of time from my relatives (step siblings and their offspring were also guests at our house). In walks my 6 year old nephew... The last one was shortly after our daughter was born. My mother-in-law had taken our daughter for a walk so we took advantage and decided to have sexy time. Again I was in cowgirl position as she walks right in after the walk not bothering to knock at all. We were in the bedroom so it's not like she just wanted to get in from outside.
I get walked in on often and usually in cowgirl. (extra sucky because I am rather busty)
Oh, I got this.  
I'm 19.  Best Friend doesn't drink.  We're having a party at her house, mostly in the basement, her parents are home.  She *finally* decides to try alcohol.  She drinks two beers, I have . . . More.   I get tipsy, have had a crush on her older brother (who is almost exactly my age) for a LOOOONG time, never, EVER mentioned it to her -because, you know, *gross.*
I've been drinking, am unbelievably horny.  Somehow Brother and I end up in his room, start going at it.  Turns out, we're both virgins and crazy DTF.  Things get hotter, heavier, we wrestle around and I end up on top of him, on top of the sheets/blankets, my ass facing his bedroom door.  
He penetrates me, we're sexing hard, making out intensely, blood everywhere (on me, all over him.) 
His door opens, very quietly.  I look over my shoulder, deer-in-headlights and MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH HIS DAD.  Also Best Friend's Dad.  While his son's blood-glazed dick is still pumping into me, and my ladyparts are totally facing him.  Best Friend's Brother NEVER EVEN NOTICES as Dad slowly closes the door and (hopefully) walks away.  I never told BF's brother, but part of me secretly hopes that they eventually had a mantalk and high fives about the whole thing.
For *weeks* I avoided their house, and to this day I feel awkward looking BF's Dad in the eye.  It's been a decade, and we've certainly hung out since, but every time we see each other after having not hung out for months he has this little grin that I just can't escape.  
Epilogue : I'm very close to their whole family, have met both of Best Friend's grandmothers, we've been on vacation with one another's families, the whole bit.  Her Mom and Dad were in the process of divorcing when **the shaming** went  down.  Almost a decade later, I go out to lunch with her Mom.  *Finally* asked her if BF's Dad had ever shared with her the events of that night.  She says yes, and that she told **her mom (!)** about it.  Grandma says, **"Well, at least we know he's not gay."**
Edit: Formatting.
Edit2: Brother was a bit of a SAP, had never had a girlfriend in high school, hence G-ma thinking he could be gay.
  Best Friends Dad fully walks in on me losing my virginity to his son, blood everywhere.
I don't mean to sound like a dick but this sweater just falls under a general category of ugliness I like to call the "mall sweater". You guys know what I'm talking about.. However, I'm glad MFA isn't doing our stereotyped thing of hating on someone who's style doesn't seem to entirely conform, but instead people are offering genuine solid advice.
- I don't like it. But you gotta do you.
First it was Aranea Lelith If I'm not mistaken by the name, then suddenly she disappeared after a few days of becoming a blade so I went and  hired Marcurio, then he died by walking in front of me right before I shot my bow so I did a little quests for the Mages college and I got J'zargo who uses one handed so I thought he wouldn't die as easily as my other mage-companions but he died when I assassinated him by accident instead of the Emperor, which was an epic fail since I didn't save since the start of the dark brotherhood. So I went exploring and I came across a little cave, killed all the falmer and at the heart of the cave was a trapped Argonian by the name Derkeethus and then I knew he was perfect ( Being Argonian myself ) after 20 hours of playing with him, nothing goes wrong, he even sneaks pretty good ( or it's just because he's wearing the Dark Brotherhood Armour ) 
If you're not playing as a mage, then don't let a mage follow you (Unless you're playing Dragon Age)
Correct. She wore the dentata as part of her regular courier garb for protection. The reason it hit Raven, is because she had forgotten it was even there, likely due to her captive state.

Cass's Q has a 3-second cooldown; Morg's shield lasts 5 seconds, and has a 15-second cooldown. Until she get's nearly full CDR, Morg's shield will be down more than half of the time, and that window is wide enough for Cass to throw two Qs at her. Even while the shield is up, every Q after the first will deal damage through the shield. Also, I'm pretty sure that a reactive shield would not remove the poisoned condition, which means that Cass would be able to start wailing on you with E. Needless to say, every E would penetrate the shield.
Cass does way too much damage for Morg to shrug it off with her shield.
White guy dating a Pacific Islander/Native American girl.  We've been together or just under a year, and all I've noticed is a couple of teasing statement about Jungle Fever from friends. But I've never had anyone say anything racist or deragatory to me while I'm with her or if I'm talking about her.  Granted I'm from Portland and am a rather...large...example of the male form of our species, so people usually don't mess with me (6'3" and 225lbs)
As for the good, EVRYTHING is good.  I love this woman with all of my heart, and her skin tone just makes her that much more attractive.  An exotic, dreamy look.  Also it means any kids e hve will be granted extremely thick and gorgeous hair, which is better than the near-bald-at-28 genes that I can pass on.
- I'm dating the woman of anyone's dreams, who cares about her skin color?
My belief is that they redline because they don't know better. After a few years of scraped knees, burnt fingers, bumped heads, they tend to learn to envision the consequences of their immediate actions. This slows them down.  By the time you get old, you become a zen master of consequences, and don't do anything.
Young - skip and run because why not?; Old - I don't even want to think what that will do to my knees.
Thanks for wasting my time.
First we agree to a deal, then you go back on your word and ask for a game that is more expensive. I counter offer and add something to sweeten the original deal you agreed to.
Then I wait around forever because you take your sweet fucking time to reply, and I ask you what your thoughts are. Then you delete me from your friend's list and ignore my friend request when I tried to readd you.
** Thanks for wasting my time, cunt.**
**Don't trade with this user, as he'll piss away your time and ask you for more at the last second.**  
Its not really due to the fact that we are exceptional, its just that the small number of people present keeps the signal / noise ratio to acceptable levels. 
More than anything, this is a great example of why democracy is such a bad idea. As I point out to friends / family all the time...would you allow a random walmart shopper to decide on what you should do with your life-savings? No? But thats exactly what happens when we all vote. 
Moreover, as the audience becomes larger, subreddits becomes ever more attractive for the sock-puppets to appear. 10 bozos with sock-puppet accounts can completely derail any meaningful conversation.
 Democracy sucks + reedit needs a sock-puppet filter. 
First date: Informed me that she used an iud so we won't have to use condoms. 
Another girl brought her friend along and proceeded to let the friend do all the talking. The girl called me the next day trying to set something up. NOPE! 
Blind first date: I was going to dinner with this one chick and she told me she had already ate when we met up. I said fuck that shit and ate anyway. She told me to drive her somewhere really quick, ended up at her pill popping uncles efficiency apartment. Met the family then GTFO. The next week I went to Biloxi to do some gambling and brought my ex (we were just fuckbuddies at the time). She calls me professing her love and I tell her I am not interested. Her cousin blows up my phone cussing out my voicemail for 3 hours. 

Had a woman 10 years older than me (19-29) tell me she loved me in the middle of sex. It was also my first day meeting her.
I was a sucker for crazy trashy broads in my younger years.
Hey so... I just did a little research on this.  I'm very interested, because I'm going to be a family medicine doctor in May and I want to know the answer to this question (also because I have a vagina and I smoke weed).
Essentially, when these ladies say that there is no research on this, they are right.  It sucks, but it's impossible to say for SURE whether smoking weed will increase your clot risk.
On the other hand (here's the part where I give unlicensed advice against my better judgment), I think it's probably a lot less risky than cigarettes because of:
Nicotine-- constricts blood vessels, which can increase clot risk and stroke risk (both because of its blood pressure effects, and independently).  This is probably the main mechanism of cigarettes causing increased clots in women on OCPs.
I do think that there is still an effect of inhaling combustion products-- there will always be toxins in smoke, which is bad for your lungs, which can in turn be bad for your heart, and your blood vessels, and your clot risk.... so vaporizing is indeed better for you (I just invested in a "fragrance machine" for Christmas).
Also, Nuvaring does give you fewer systemic hormones than oral contraceptives (more of it stays locally) but you still have higher clot risk with it than without it.
***: Smoking weed is **probably** not as likely to give you clots while you're on birth control as tobacco is.
Hoooooolyyy shiiiiiiit that amount of text.  /joke.
Really amazing work son!
You've just got be considerate. While it sucks and is sad, it's completely up to her if she wants to make changes in her life. You shouldn't force anything on anybody, even if you know it's a good thing.
you can open a door, but it's up to them to walk through it
How can something with negative calorific value taste so fucking terrible?
Not only does it taste like the Devil just puked in my mouth, but it contaminates everything it touches. It should be treated like culinary nuclear waste.

1. Like you, I was born an atheist.
2. My parents did not indoctrinate me during my upbringing, so I stayed an atheist.
3. A few attempts have been made by people in my adulthood to try to convert me to Christianity.  One was a very underhanded approach using apologetics.  A woman I was interested in gave me a few books by Josh McDowell to read.  I had not thought about religion much up until this point, so I was initially confused by what I read and seriously considered converting.  But I was able to see the flaw in the arguments -- the flaws betrayed McDowell as being dishonest in his argument.  I was so ticked off by his that I decided to "bone up" on the issues and transitioned from being a superficial atheist into a very hardcore and well informed atheist.
4. The second attempt has been on-going.  One of my close childhood friends is a creationist.  He's taken it upon himself to try to "save me".  He has no idea how futile this is.  At this point, I am so atheist I make Richard Dawkins look like an ayatollah.  He keeps throwing bizarre nonsense he gets from creationist websites at me in hopes it will sway me.  I've even told him that I actually do "opposition research" up front to debunk this garbage.  It has not deterred him.  I asked him one question in response: look at the Vostok and EPICA ice cores and explain to me how objects that are 400,000 and 740,000 years old can exist on a 10,000 year old planet.  That was 4 years ago.  He has yet to answer this.
5. The only time I ever go to church is to attend funerals or other people's weddings.  I try not to make a fuss about it unless someone else brings up something -- it hasn't been an issue so far.
6. Like most atheists, I didn't *decide* that god doesn't exist.  I simply put it in the same category as Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, the lochness monster, big foot, and so on.  There is no better reason to think god exists than any of those things, and they all are more associated with childish thinking than reality.
7. When you are a child you ask questions from teachers and parents because you don't know anything.  When you are an adolescent you ask questions from your peers because you want to fit in.  When you are an adult you ask questions of the universe because you can and the answers are more reliable.  The church is hoping that people stay in the first stage, and to be a surrogate for the parents and teachers for people who are not young or in school.  Regardless the church has no answers, so even for the questions I do have, I would not seek answers there.
**  I am so atheist I make Richard Dawkins look like an ayatollah**
At the same time you chose to be straight or gay.
 Default state.
My mind was not made up for me.  There are three books (in English) that I particulary remember having
 1. A copy of Tell Me Why
 2. A book on Dinasours that also had short chapters on the fromation of the Solar system, and Evolution after the dinasours
 3. A thick  book of very nicely illustrated Bible stories 
Somehow I never even suspected that anyone would percieve the Bible stories as anything more then just stories. I could say myths but I don't think 9 year old me really knew that word. Meanwhile the other two books read like they where about reality. I remember declaring that I believed in Science not God. 
At around the same time I also volantarily went to after school bible study (because they gave out cookies) And even when to Church with a friend and his mother (I remember being very bored and fidgety).  A while later I was forced into Scripture class at school (1 hour per week) when the new Principle decided that he didn't want any non-scritpure pupels in his school.  So I learned About Catholicism and the Bible but none of it could shake my, at the time naive, faith that science had better answers. 
As A teenager I tried on Norse Paganism, and Buddhism.  Then studied Psycology and Phillosophy at University. Post Uni I  tried on 19th Century Occultism, mostally based on the writings of Alister Crowley and later  Wicca. And every time ended up back at a naturalistic world view, though each time somewhat less naively so. 
  I'm an atheist because all my attempts to be something else have lead me back to atheism. 

This will inevitably get buried under a ton of comments, but anyway
placing a maddres DIRECTLY on solid materials (like wooden floors) as we see here is not the brightest idea, the body sweats *a lot* during sleep and all this water needs to evaporate somehow. the sweat will sink to the buttom of your madress if the madress cant breathe, this creates a crhonic moist enviroment, perfect for fungus. Your madress will soon begin to smell molden and it can in some cases become a health issue. this will ruin your madress unless you constantly flip it and change it.
 there is a reason we have beds
That is pretty sweet. However, I would worry about getting down at night when I had to go to the bathroom really bad. I'd probably end up falling, hurting myself, and lose control of my bodily functions.
Then when the EMT's come to help me out I would be so ashamed. Hopefully they would think my apartment was too cool and not notice I soiled myself.
 If I fell from the bed and peed myself it would be embarrassing.
This made me laugh so hard when I scrolled down and saw "Teachers Orders."
I don't know what else to say dude but shit that was really funny.
I mean, I'm having trouble typing this because I'm still laughing. No joke.
Funny comic though man.
whattt this was funny
It's kinda hard to lump all the weapons into one giant umbrella term of "role stealing" and simply say either they're all bad and game breaking, or they're all perfectly fine and contribute to the flow of the game. For instance, the pain train is considered  by a lot of people to be completely useless on a demoman due to the fact that scouts are extremely hard to deal with once they get in, not to mention it has literally no affect on maps without capture times. On the other hand, weapons like the mad milk were ridiculously good and allowed classes to accomplish the task of 2 classes at the same time.

There's also the fact that people of lower/higher skill levels will feel differently about certain weapons. This actually comes up a lot when leagues are discussing what weapons will be banned for the season, players in the lower/middle divisions will have completely different opinions from the high level players. The Crusader's Crossbow might look horrible in a pub on 2fort, but then when someone like Pyour starts using it on a map like coldfront, it can start to look viable. It's impossible to say whether a weapon is disruptive to the game in its entirety.

On top of that, the analysis of some role stealing weapons is a bit too shallow. For instance, the ambassador is said to steal headshots from the sniper. A headshot isn't just a crit for shooting someone in the head, it's rewarding a player for landing a harder shot. When you think of it this way, tonnes of weapons suddenly become "role stealing"; the axtinguisher, kritzkrieg, backburner, buff banner, anything that gives crits for a specific situation, and yet you wouldn't say they all steal the role of a certain class. Why is this? It's because the weapons have enough difference in them that prevents them from turning the spy into "Sniper with cloak". The ambassador will never be able to kill any class in one hit, it doesn't have the zoom of the sniper rifle, it has spread on its shots when fired rapidly, there's so many things that prevent it from being a sniper rifle. The same thing applies to most of the weapons you listed. The short circuit can get rid of projectiles sure, but it consumes metal, which prevents the engineer from repairing or upgrading his buildings, not to mention it has no potential to **return and even amplify** damage. Not only are these weapons weak comparisons, but the classes themselves don't fit into a single role. Just about any class can fit into the role of area denial, or assassin, or intel/point capper, or flanker, or whatever else. A pyro's role isn't concrete and stuck at "Engineer buddy/pybro", a pyro can be played as a flanker, pocket, backcapper, whatever. The classes aren't separated by what they can or can't do, they're separated by what they can do easiest. Yes, the backburner will let the pyro be more affective as a flanking assassin, but the pyro will never be as effective as the spy, where he can pick out key targets at anytime, and escape unseen.
So yes some weapons allow classes to crossover, but no, it's not game breaking. Classes already cross over a bunch, it just makes it easier for them to perform tasks that are associated with other classes.

The tax code is too complicated to just say "whats my bottom line."
First, presidents don't write laws so no matter what they say about taxes, the tax laws are passed in congress and a president can only sign or veto it. That's one reason why they don't get specific about taxes.
You also need to define what 'average' is, according to 2006 census data the avg income is $50,233.00. 
This web site ( shows tax brackets for the last 20 years and you can see that they have been pretty consistent. They change a percent here or there, but nothing dramatic. So for both D and R presidents you're getting the same income rates. 
What you will see change are deductions and capital gains tax. Right now you can write off a number of things like your mortgage interest, energy efficient home improvements, a % of the cost of a hybrid car, etc.  The tax you pay on profit from investment has changed quite a bit in the last 20 years. It went from 20% down to 0% thanks mainly to a Bush Jr 
**TLDR congress controls your taxes, presidents just talk about them**

to expand on this, reCaptcha is an effort to translate scanned version of books into online-searchable documents by using you to type in the letters that a computer could not 'read' by itself.
to do this, reCaptcha gives 2 sets of words. one word is from a scanned document (in your case, the mathematical equation) and the other is a series of letters generated by a computer (a set of letters that the computer knows the 'answer' to). if you type in the correct set of letters that the computer already knows the answer to, it will assume you have typed in something semi-accurate for the text it does not know as well, and record that information.
you could have typed "penis iginedb" and it would have worked.
Does that not include Ep.2 and charge as it having that too if that makes sense? I got Ep.2 before Xmas and was gutted as I didn't think I would be able to get the others but I got a bit of money over Xmas and put some away to buy it.
TL,DR; Short on cash, would prefer not buying Ep.2 twice.
Thanks anyway.
Becoming an atheist because of that makes perfect logical sense if you think about it. What we have here is the Problem of Evil.
A claim was made to her, and that claim was proved wrong. The claims can be many, but here it seems that one could be that "in church, God is more present, because a church is God's House." *If you ever went to church, you've heard this.*
What kind of God would let this happen in His house?
And how would you worship Him?
Another claim destroyed would be that "God is all-good and all-loving."
A God that let this happen in His house could not be good.
Therefore, at the very least, this God could not exist.
She was already an atheist towards other Gods, so this one was finally vanquished.
So it makes perfect sense that this incident should make her logically an atheist.
**TL/DR** Don't let other atheists tell you what you are or aren't, sweetheart. You know who you are.
About 8 years ago I found this little kitten that had been badly beaten. Whiskers burned off, kicked so hard a large portion of it's intestines had pushed out of the intestinal wall (massive hernia), face smashed up, etc.
So I took the little guy to the vet. He told me the surgery to fix his intestines probably wouldn't hold, and he wouldn't make it. I spent about $2000 getting him fixed up regardless. Post surgery, I was instructed to keep him as immobile as possible, or else he might tear open his insides, since the intestine patch was so extensive.
So for about 3 months "kitty" (we didn't want to name him incase he didn't make it) lived just like this. In a cat jail with a cone on his head (he had a 6 inch incision with stitches). I put the jail next to my computer, and we'd hang out together while I played tribes or RTCW. I'd let him out for a few minutes a day, under careful watch.
In the end, he made it. He still has a few random hip problems, but overall he's a happy cat living with my mom as an indoor/outdoor cat. He hates being cooped up inside, although he greatly enjoys sleeping on old CRT monitors.
** Cat jails are sometimes necessary**
No.
I agree that almost every tv show seems to be based on weak unloveable losers, especially comedies. But although I hate those characters and how they act and what they stand for, they shows are popular because so many other weak willed fools identify with those characters and like them, or at the very least to see them succeed (eg how I met your mother).
As for the quotes you mentioned I can't think of any and there are probably a lot more about being single that we are both unaware of. I wouldn't worry about it. 
Tldr tv and literature are not mocking you, but society does have many other unhelpful views on the situation. 
I'm an editor with a bachelor's in Linguistics, and I am wrestling with this topic with fellow colleagues. In linguisitics we learn the difference between prescriptive and descriptive grammar. "Prescriptive" means someone sits down and decides what a language's grammar should look like, and others follow the rules laid out. "Descriptive" means you talk with a native speaker and diagram what they say naturally.
There are problems with both. What naturally comes from a native speaker can have mistakes because they are rushed, trying to say two things at once, or confused by bad rules that have been foisted on them. So what comes out could be mangled or unnatural. However, when speaking fluently, there is no "wrong" in a language from a native speaker. Every human brain is wired to accept certain language features (Universal Grammar), which every natural language conforms to, so if a language is natural, it naturally has rules. Break the rules, and if the broken rule is learned naturally (by children, without being taught), the infraction will be transformed to fit the Universal Grammar. (For example, pidgin languages are an artificial mix of two or more languages. However, if kids grow up hearing pidgin, they may transform it to a creole, which is a pidgin language turned into a full-blown language.)
The harm in prescribing a language is that a person may not really know the rule behind a pattern they see, and may overly restrict something or identify a part of speech wrong. And then people are propogating an unnatural rule of speech that will possibly cause difficulties when a native speaker naturally inclines towards a certain other way of speaking because it feels right. And then worse, the ability to "feel right" or "wrong" about a phrase becomes more difficult to do naturally because you are thinking, what would my English teacher say?
ANYway, had to vent a bit there. As an editor who uses prescriptive rules all the time, the key is consistency. Some projects I work on want things a certain way, and within that project that rule is followed. Another project may have the opposite rule. Basically, consistency is our master in editing--disobey it and it's a tragic error that we imagine a reader will see and be confused by or at the very least have the sense of messiness.
TL,DR: Consistency is key, especially in writing. Separate institutions may prescribe their own rules that break standard conventions. 'Tis ok.
EDIT: I'm an editor, I couldn't help myself. Clarity mostly.
Keep it no reason not too.  Don't feel guilty for that.  If maybe 3-4 million people did that at the same time it would be useful. Otherwise what is the point?  If you feel that strongly regarding the matter maybe taking an alternate course of activism?  
tl/dr Don't sell out yourself if nothing can be accomplished.
10+ years in the data center industry - Netherlands is the actually the smarter bet / 1 Gig lines are cheaper there than the US. Also NL was the 1st country to pass Net Neutrality. Oh and SOPA / PIPA. 
Amsterdam / Haarlem, Netherlands (EvoSwitch) is the Fiber central of Europe, and EvoSwitch / LeaseWeb is a major carrier. Think cheap Dedicated boxes (Like Nocster/VolumeDrive) with EU laws and freedom. 
100 MBPS Full Duplex on those machines for ~ 19 euros per month.
Also, Leaseweb also started a US data center in Manhassas, VA, but if you want a seedbox, put it in LeaseWeb Europe.
- NL is full of fast backbones. 
There's actually quite a few of these out there. I've got a copy and wasn't that hard to find. Cheap too. 

That's part of the "worst game ever" myth. It's not that it plays as the worst game ever (by Atari 2600 standards it was pretty ok once you actually know what the goal was) but it's the fact that they VASTLY overestimated the popularity of it. They made tons of these cartridges, more than any other game at that point. Vendors couldn't give them away if they wanted to since almost everyone had one and there was still a ton left over. They sold over a million copies of the thing. Due to the overstock issue, this led to many of the games being thrown away and chalked-up as a loss to Atari, starting their downward spiral due to the debt (arguably causing part of the video game industry crash). 

*** - ET isn't actually *that* bad of a game (try the 2600 version of pac-man, it's awful). It wasn't great, but gets a hugely bad name due to perpetuated myths and Atari's poor marketing/manufacturing decisions which basically ruined the company.
I posted this in response to another comment but thought it deserved its own post:

HELL NO. You don't need a libertarian perspective to understand how biased a *government regulatory agency* is.
For example. In the military contractor industry, the government has different companies bid on who wants to be approved for the next ten years. If your company wins the bid, they serve as a proxy for the ten years *regardless of their work in the field.*
So there is a company in my hometown that is a proxy company in the greatest sense. They no longer do any work in the business, they just serve as a middle man and take 2%. That is literally their business model.
Not only will the government be biased, but it is proud and clear in its bias of companies in other industries.
Well, sorry for writing a paragraph and not separating each sentence with a line break. 
The gist of it though, is even if you split the console numbers in half they are more than steam.
Steam numbers are inflated as well with duplicate accounts, and TF2 idle farming accounts.
Demons souls started out on PS3, and spread to xbox with dark souls because they are both consoles and have relatively the same audience, that is why PC being lead design is crazy talk.
I am done with this conversation.
**TLDR- You seem mad and criticize my writing instead of actually saying anything other than PC elitist Douchebaggery.**
It all comes down to the environment that you'll be moshing in. Black Keys concert? Yeah, that's a no go. Harcore/Metal concerts? You can bet yourself that people are going to mosh. In those instances, you just need to position yourself away from the pit. Be observant, be smart and realize where people are around you. If you feel footsteps and swirling bodies around you, it's time to move.
As for the overall experience of moshing, it's either something your get or you don't. It's a release of energy and aggression but in a **safe** format (considering you don't have fucks purposely trying to kill people). When you're surrounded by hundreds of other people, enjoying the show, feeling the energy of the band, people start moshing. That fact alone makes moshing an amazing concert experience, in my opinion.
- people that mosh at NMH concerts are idiots, pay attention if you choose not to get caught up in the pit and moshing is energy.

well, you see, its a very good story.
in the old days i would only sit in a dark room for a long day playing DotA and chatting my friends on Ventrillo I was with a bunch of bitches who had no idea what they were doing. They kept on wanting to watch, when they had no idea what they were doing. They were hot as shit though, so i didnt really care.
Moving on, my mom came in the room, and i started screaming "We're sitting here in Ventrilo and playing a bit of DotA!". Little did she know, after listening to Huskaars voice for a little while saying "I feel you man", all of the guys and girls in the room, including myself were transported to a club, in which all of the girls started to suddenly strip their clothing, start to dance, and scream about how they loved me, who was apparently a Swedish pop star. I, however, knew all the words to a song about this same game i loved.

Unsubsidized phones only make sense in the rest of the world since the carriers use the same tech and radio frequencies so if you don't like the price,features or contract terms of a carrier you can just switch, The U.S market does not have that leeway as I think the Carriers planned for this as pretty much the top 4 carriers all use different tech (Radio frequencies) so you are pretty much locked into them with your phone so they have little incentive to please you as the telcos from other countries do, Funny thing is AT&amp;T is the closest thing you'll get to a normal global GSM network with the exception of them using 850mhz for HSPA+ (world mostly uses 900mhz)
 Before the Galaxy Nexus HSPA+ (Due to it being Pentaband) , say if you had a falling out with AT&amp;T your only choice would be to buy a new phone with the required radios and join up with the other 3 carriers or find a MVNO that uses the AT&amp;T network. With the Galaxy Nexus being penta band (Only phone in the world right now) if you had falling out with AT&amp;T you could just go jump onto T-Mobile or either of their MVNO's (Still not the case if you have CDMA based phone or want to go to them).
 So yeah,  if you do go on a plan with AT&amp;T or T-Mobile on a unsubsidized phone it isn't that much better then one which does give you subsidized phone but the contract terms might be only say 12 months instead of 24 (maybe they might give you more minutes too). Due to lack of competition as you can't just bring your current phone over. Unsubsidized phones are really ment for pre-paid/PAYG people anyways. 
The market is huge in countries like AU where it's said that 50% (read it someplace ages ago, Can't remember where) of people are on them due to competition as all the telco's there are GSM and most of the time the plans are cheaper because they don't include the phone repayment as part of plan and you usually get better deals because the telcos want you to stay with them (You also of cause get worst deals that prey on non technical people with crazy clauses that get you if you don't read fine print)

 Anyways, Not sure if this helps you but just telling you the facts how it works and if it's really worth going the unsubsidized route or not.

Btw, Didn't the Galaxy Nexus already pass [FCC for AT&amp;T just a month ago?]( It seems to indicate it will be a gimped (Quad band only) version WITHOUT the t-mobile radios which the international version has (Penta band) meaning it will hit AT&amp;T in a few weeks or months after the exclusivity deal with Verizon is over. Again the U.S telcos are locking people into it's network by disabling key features that the world takes for granted. Maybe the T-Mobile version will have the AT&amp;T frequencies disabled too, or not as it would big selling point for their version as it would be a global phone and most likely come out after AT&amp;T version so they need all the advantages it can 
No the Skyrocket is HD is nothing like the Galaxy Nexus as it's a totally different chipset and ment for LTE while the Galaxy Nexus is a HSPA+ device (Not including the Verizon version which has CDMA/LTE)
BTW you can get a Nexus Galaxy for around $550-700US if you shop around online anyways. The 4S would more then pay for it and you'll get the ungimped international version.
: None really unless you get some more minutes/data and shorter contract
Actually, there's a huge benefit to buying unsubsidized phones on T-mobile, at least if you use the special plans. T-mobile has either [value plans]( (no sub, yes contract) or [Monthly4G plans]( (no sub, no contract) that are $15-$20 cheaper than their [subsidized plans]( which adds up to $360-$480 over two years. 
Of course, since T-mobile tends to have lots of sales (I believe the HTC Sensation was free online during the holidays), buying an unsubsidized phone still might not save you more money over the long run. But without sales, we can estimate how much cheaper buying unsubsidized is. Using the Sensation as our example, an unlocked Sensation is $400 on ebay at the moment, while $229 on contract. The Unlimited Talk+Text+2GB Data plan is $70/month on the Monthly4G plan and $90/month on the contract plan, which makes the unsubbed plan $480 cheaper over 2 years. This makes it so the actual cost of the subsidized phone is $709, which is actually $309 more expensive than a subsidized phone! And the true bargain hunter would never buy new; another $90 can be saved by purchasing a used Sensation, which is $310 right now on Swappa, and seems to have [gone for even less]( in the past.
Now, icky_boo has already given you a long answer on how unsubsidized phones just aren't worth it in the US. And if you just take a look at the major carriers, it seems to be true. I'm not aware of any AT&amp;T or Verizon plans that are cheaper without subsidization, or even Sprint. Since AT&amp;T and Verizon seem to own the **overwhelming** majority of the US market share (Verizon has 1/3 of the US population as subscribers, for God's sake!), they get away with being significantly more expensive than T-mobile and Sprint. Since you're on AT&amp;T, I'll use them as an example: $85/month for 4GB of data and 450 minutes (which is plenty) compared to T-mobile's $70 a month for 1GB more data and unlimited talk (which isn't very necessary, but still good). Maybe you get some sort of discount for being a loyal AT&amp;T customer through the years, but to someone who's switching from a different carrier, I don't see a reason to choose AT&amp;T over T-mobile (though AT&amp;T's subsidized phone prices are *slightly* cheaper).
All in all, the US carrier market kind of sucks, but T-mobile is the least evil choice out of the big 4 carriers. In fact, I'd even say that they seem like the good guy in all this. I'm not sure if AT&amp;T and Verizon offer cheaper unsubsidized plans, so I might be wrong with my analysis, but I don't see a reason to _not_ be on T-mobile (or Sprint) if price is your main factor. We really lack competition in the United States, and it's awful unfair to us as consumers. If AT&amp;T had gone ahead and bought T-mobile, we'd be in an even worse situation competition-wise. But good thing that deal never happened, and T-mobile is still here to show some competitive pricing.
Disclaimer: I'm not a T-mobile salesman or anything, but I have been with them for over 5 years.
**if you're not on T-mobile: no. If you're on T-mobile: yes**
I got paid yesterday but was a little depressed because I only had one small bowl left and didn't think I'd be able to find any because usually one of my friends usually gets it from his hometown.  I texted him to see if he'd be able to go, and he texted this back to me- 'hey bro, im home right now, Ill go ahead and buy some for you and you can pay me back when I get back to town tonight.' 
TL;DR
My friend is good guy greg.  Yesterday he was at least.
I personally liked apocalypse as a sequel to the xcom series.  I felt nice to find a sequel that wasn't a simple re-hash of the older game.  Though it wasn't as great as the first two.
The first major difference is the city obviously, UFO attacks come in waves (5+ UFOs at a time) and ganging up your interceptors on targets in necessary.   If you watch the UFOs while they are attacking you can watch them beam troops down into various structures so you can send your troops in a pre-emptive strike on the structure before you get an alien sighted warning.  If you wait too long aliens will run away and spread to nearby structures in the city.
The addition of a real-time mode makes the battles go a lot quicker, but this comes at a serious cost to the turn-based battles.  Starting in the first few battles the aliens get to lauch little alien-esque brain-suckers at you that perma-mind control your troops.  The only way to really fight these guys in Turn-Based without losses is via a lot of save-scumming and it ends up being a measure in frustration (at least it was for me).  In the real time mode, your soldiers are a lot better at shooting the little suckers before they do their dirty work.
  Its got almost everything that made X-com great, but with frustrating turn based battles.  The best thing to do is try it out.
P.S. Dont bother with land based vehicles at all.  They get destroyed when the road underneath them is destroyed.
Overall I think it falls just a bit short, but only due to not being as fully fleshed out as it should have been. Very much worth your time to play, if only to see the ideas they were trying to implement. I personally think future XCOM style games could learn a thing or two from Apocalypse.
For one thing, UFO interception was changed up from the old model and largely for the better I feel, bugs aside. You can field a rather high number of vehicles in Apocalypse unlike in the originals since you're not restricted to the number hangar bays. You must worry about terrain being destroyed in Apocalypse at least a little bit, since excessive damage has a high impact on your weekly score. Though, it's very rare to have any risk of extensive damage until late into the game. Other factions have their own military capabilities and can field their own vehicles to help or hinder your efforts. They also added ground vehicles, though they are nigh unusable due to a trait of the game engine that causes them to be destroyed when the road tile underneath them is destroyed (which can be easily done by pretty much any weapon...). All vehicles are fairly customizable compared to the ones in original XCOM. Beyond weapons, you can add in a variety of things like transport modules, cargo modules, targeting systems, new engines for human craft, and eventually deflector shields &amp; cloaking devices when you manage to salvage them from a wreck.
As for agent gear, you start off with a rather large selection compared to original XCOM, a couple of things which can remain useful even later on in the game. You have access to armor from the get-go this time and it doesn't suck at all. In fact, it takes the early aliens a good bit of effort to damage you with it on, save for a things like hyperworms or poppers. The only real threat early on is the brain sucker. For an idea of what it's like, imagine chrysalids but with all the durability of a wet sectoid. Their attack is also not 100% effective and regardless of success they die instantly upon delivery. As the aliens start fielding actual weaponry though, things start getting dicey if you're not careful. This time around, you can even research biological weapons from the aliens you haul in. Highly effective bio-weapons at that.
For the diplomacy, it was regrettably only partially implemented from what I've read online. Basically, you only have to worry about keeping the other organizations from going hostile (and thus attacking your craft on sight and raiding your bases). Forging alliances is of rather limited use considering the costs involved. While allies sometimes help you fight alien ships, it's usually only when they become directly threatened by them. Only the police make any sense to ally with since they actually regularly deploy armed hovercars to patrol the city, but don't expect too much of them past the first week. Some organizations can make winning the game very difficult if they go hostile, such as transtellar (city transport company) suddenly refusing to transport new hires to your base, MegaPol (the police) or Marsec (old XCOM gone security company) attacking your craft on sight and refusing to sell you any weapons (both combined supply the vast majority of all weapons/armor early on), or the city senate which results in an automatic game-over.
One neat thing about the tactical battles in Apocalypse is the ability to raid the buildings of other organizations. Instead of showing up and inspecting for alien presence, you can kick in the door, gun down the security, and loot the building. You can end up with any variety of random pieces of equipment from these raids, and even get drugs if you raid certain criminal factions which can be turned around quickly for a rather nice profit. Of course, your bases can still be raided and unlike the original XCOM it's much more dangerous with your scientists and engineers now being targets of opportunity during these events. Also, since your bases are basically built at the basement level of above ground structures, aliens and enemy factions can simply bomb them into the ground to purge one of your bases (which also results in a score penalty for you thanks to extensive damage done to the city in the process). In Apocalypse, you'll have to consider the above ground structure as well as the basement layout when building new bases.
** It's not quite as good as the originals overall, but is totally worth checking out for some of the interesting features they were trying to use.**

I'm atheist. My parents make me go to the mosque because they don't know. The Imam says to treat all people with respect. This includes gays, women, and races(I've seen white, black, and even asian Muslims where did you get this idea?). Nobody believes in slavery anymore. No matter what the books say. Genocide? You probably think Muslims are supposed to kill non-believers, because you are a smart atheist right? Well the Quran teaches only self defense. The violent passages were written in time of war, and only to attack when attacked. 
 Quit being an angry teenager. Love and respect everybody. Tolerance makes the world a better place. Not atheism. 
Respect... see heres the problem, alien005, when i say we shouldn't respect islam you call me a hypocrite, suggest im narrow minded, and generally suggest I should not be respected. Why? Because I don't respect "religion". When Islam, however, has it written in the koran that infidels like you and me should be put to death, you say "hold on now, I don't agree with that but lets respect it!" So tell me, why the different stance between my intolerance and Islam's intolerance? If anything you should respect my intolerace because I don't tolerate a choice to be hateful whereas Islam's intolerance is about petty things like gender. But alas, you think the label "religion" affords Islam some special status and I say thats bull shit, which was my original point.
 you wont tolerate me for not tolerating Islam, but you will tolerate Islam for not tolerating gays, women, science because they're called religion and I'm not and I call bull shit.
I'm not saying there shouldn't be any negative consequences either (there's a reason why people hate Westboro Baptist stuff, for example), but for me to have to fear for my life...over a picture? Words are words, pictures are pictures, but violence is a completely different category.
Should I prepared to get punched if I walk in a bar and call the biggest guy there a bitch? Sure. Should I have to fear that some zealot is going to leave a bomb at place because I drew a picture and said "This is Muhammed"? 
I saw a video on youtube called "[The Real God: An Epiphany]( and the version is that when it comes to religion, God is actually the believer, so when you make fun of God, the person takes it as an insult to himself. It's one thing to ridicule a person, it's another to ridicule an idea

i'm sorry, Americans, but as far as I can tell Skrillex's fanbase is primarily American kids, and with that in mind I'm not really surprised they aren't aware of the decades of challenging electronic music that came along before the US take on dubstep (aka brostep) blew up. 
From what I've seen - being a foreigner who's been DJing electronic music for nearly two decades (i used to own Orbital albums on *cassette*!) - the US hasn't really kept up with developments in electronic music since the early 90s. There were some gains, but until this recent explosion of dubstep (and R'n'B that sounds like eurohouse from ten years ago), it just didn't penetrate the national psyche the same way it did in the UK and elsewhere in Europe + worldwide.
I'd say this is mainly because house / techno in the US, even though it was an American invention to begin with, never reached the incredibly popular 'superstar DJ' zenith it did in the UK in the mid 90s - helped by cheap e and the Summer of Love at the end of the 80s, of course - instead, it was seen as music for The Gays and Burning Man. That means Americans were largely oblivious to the subsequent experimentation that gave us, for example, geniuses such as Amon Tobin, Luke Vibert, Herbert and Aphex Twin, and labels such as Warp and Ninjatune. Drum'n'bass never really caught on there, and neither did 2step, garage, or breaks- they're all quite dark and introspective music, and the US clubs were dominated by hiphop and related club genres (eg, Miami bass) that tended to be a lot more uptempo and, I don't know.. brash? Obvious? 
Whatever it was, the US missed out on a lot of good music from that area. So I'm glad someone with influence like this guy is trying to redress that balance.
**TL:DR;** Americans didn't do enough ecstasy in the 90s
edit: i'm aware a lot of you were probably listening to.. what do you guys call it again.. 'idm'? 'electronica'? but it just didn't have the social acceptance / traction it did in the UK- hell, 'Windowlicker' was #16 in the overall Singles chart in the UK when it came out, and it was NME's Single of the Year in 1999. *That*'s what I'm talking about.
Check out Lost in Shangri-La. I usually don't recomend books on random posts, but as soon as I saw this it made me think of this book. My dad gave it to me &amp; said that I'd like it &amp; that I'd probably never heard of this.  Here's the review from Amazon:

On May 13, 1945, twenty-four American servicemen and WACs boarded a transport plane for a sightseeing trip over “Shangri-La,” a beautiful and mysterious valley deep within the jungle-covered mountains of Dutch New Guinea. Unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton’s bestselling novel Lost Horizon, this Shangri-La was home to spear-carrying tribesmen, warriors rumored to be cannibals.
But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers pulled through. Margaret Hastings, barefoot and burned, had no choice but to wear her dead best friend’s shoes. John McCollom, grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the plane, masked his grief with stoicism. Kenneth Decker, too, was severely burned and suffered a gaping head wound.
Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to the hidden dangers of the jungle, the trio faced certain death unless they left the crash site. Caught between man-eating headhunters and enemy Japanese, the wounded passengers endured a harrowing hike down the mountainside—a journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man—or woman.
Drawn from interviews, declassified U.S. Army documents, personal photos and mementos, a survivor’s diary, a rescuer’s journal, and original film footage, Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio—dehydrated, sick, and in pain—traversed the dense jungle to find help; how a brave band of paratroopers risked their own lives to save the survivors; and how a cowboy colonel attempted a previously untested rescue mission to get them out.
By trekking into the New Guinea jungle, visiting remote villages, and rediscovering the crash site, Zuckoff also captures the contemporary natives’ remembrances of the long-ago day when strange creatures fell from the sky. A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying, enlightening, and comic, Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end.
tl; dr: A group of men &amp; women crash a plane during WWII into a place that's never ever seen white people. 
This is very good for your overall knowledge. However, this won't help you impress any IT Manager. If you don't plan to go study in college or something similar, try to get a job in the field. Then you'll have experience to show off in your application, even if not entirely related. Your MCITP will have more value, even if you didn't touch a server (in a business environment) in your life.
Almost every IT guys that I met that didn't come off the college or university, had some basic experience like "BestBuy Computers Sales" or such.
Don't get me wrong tho, those guys are some of the best and WAY more competent IT workers that I have met. Most of the time, ITs are their passion and this WILL make a huge difference in your career. The problem is always to make your first step in the IT field, then  its easier to show off your skill, and fill application for a step higher.
** Learn by yourself is great, but get some experience while doing so. Even if the job is poorly related to sysadmin.**
Yes and no. Most "change your profile picture" campaigns are about things everyone already fuckin knows about. Like breast cancer, or child molestation. This one is based off of the assumption that since SOPA/PIPA has gotten so little press coverage, and is attempting to be rushed through congress, not as many people have seen it. Especially not those who dont follow current events more than looking at their yahoo news feed.
 Not because its reddit doing it, but because, unlike cancer, this shit is broadcast everywhere yet.
Well, one the one hand you have people who, when presented with a banner, summation, and link, will follow the link and educate themselves and may or may not make a call or send an email in protest.
On the other hand you have those who's intelligence, attention span, capacity, etc. doesn't afford them the opportunity to follow a link like that or care much about a banner. They might, however, be drawn into an ADHD targeted, cutesy, simple animation and, having sat though all 12 seconds of it, might also send an email or at the very least talk about it with friends and/or re-post it.
- having both the agreed pic/banner and posting the oatmeal link aren't mutually exclusive nor will either alienate the demographic most likely to be swayed by each approach.
For the laziest, it's okay.
June 15th, 2008.  25, just finished spring term of college, living with my parents in a suburb of Portland, Oregon.  Bars, clubs, museums, stores, movie and live action theaters, and all the comforts, interests, and distractions that a city and surrounding area of 2 million people can provide.
June 16th, 2008.  Report fo my first day as a wildland firefighter at a US Wildlife Refuge near the Oregon/California/Nevada border junction.  A county larger than Connetticut, but with a total population of less than 8000.  I work on a refuge of 280,000 acres, with a total staff of 38.  I now live in a bunkhouse with 9 other 20-something males, providing 100% for myself, and in order to buy clothes or see a movie I have to drive over 300 miles round-trip.  The nearest store for buying food is 60 miles away.  The nearest interstate is a 4 hour drive away.
- Went from the 22nd largest city in the nation to a location that's one of the most remote possible in the continental 48 states.
I type this from my bedroom at my parents house where i am currently living for now.
I was recovering from depression, bad final breakup with cheating ex-gf (depression was before final breakup), best friend dying of cancer at age 20, horrible job, horrible weather in ohio with winter coming.  So I decided one day to look for a new job out of state to start new.  Found a listing i was beyond perfectly qualified for on a Wednesday, applied Thursday, interviewed on Friday.
Saturday changed my life forever.  I was hired!!!!
This job not only took me away from the cold weather, the ex, and the old horrible job, it almost doubled my pay, and the location couldn't be better....
I was moving to to Florida Keys!!!!!!! (Marathon to be specific)
Just one year later I no longer work at that job, or live in Marathon.  As I type this from my parents bedroom I would like to point out I said I am currently living with my parents for now..... because why would I pay for a hotel to come visit my family and friends for a week?  I still live in the keys and live in Key West now!!!!  I have a rare home on the water with super cheap rent with super awesome roomates, I have a decent job (though no longer the nice paying one that got me to the keys),  I can go fishing whenever I feel like it, snorkeling is a short 10 minute boat ride, my sister just bought me a speargun for Christmas, my old friends at my old job finally all got better employment elsewhere too, my ex is stuck living with her parents in Cleveland stuck in the cold, while I enjoy the caribbean sunshine.
My old routine was wake up at 10pm, work (shitty job) 11p-7a, go to other job (decent) 8a-12p, sleep 1-10p.  Days off filled with other part time work. Rinse repeat
My new routine is wake up around 11, have coffee watch news, browse reddit sitting at the tiki bar out back on the canal, around 1 start drinking lightly, maybe watch tv, play xbox, or go kayaking.  Around 5 get some grub, go chill with friends, drink more or trees depending on who I am hanging out with, party or chill with people until 2 or 3 am, go to bed.
My new job actually required me to go on a 2 hour jet ski tour for free this past Friday, meanwhile Ohio was getting dumped on with snow.  I was blasting around in tropical waters while my cheating ex was getting snowed on.  Ahhh real life karma can be such a bitch.
p.s. one downside is I found an awesome girl too... but she is moving away from key west soon so that was detoured into the friendzone... o well, if I really asked for anything better than what I already got I would just be getting greedy.
edit* just to clarify I am 24, i plan on having a few years of fun and then move away and start a career.
cashed in my real life karma, living in a tropical paradise, also reddit was huge motivator to get up and find the new job.
Speaking as a non-USAian I blame US teen drama TV shows. This is an oversimplification, there is a certain amount of chicken and egg going on. To my eye the ideas presented in these shows are a highly concentrated study of all that is wrong with human interactions, the quest for status, the use of other people to attain status, rigid social hierarchies and roles and at best trivial questioning of the current state of society.
I worry about my son watching such things and internalising the concepts within them, the contrast with shows produced in the UK is astonishing. There are seriously well written dramas aimed at young teenagers that cover a wide range of issues that don't feel like cookie cutter "Here is the officially sanctioned viewpoint on minority issue X."

This was like two years ago. After a party during the week, I had my boyfriend spend the night, thinking that both my parents would be working the next day so he could sneak out unnoticed.
FYI, my parents never let anyone sleep over, I only did this because I thought none would notice. 
But **NO**. My dad had to go to work at like 12, so I had to hide him in the upper part of my two-story-bedroom. I brought him coffee etc and everything went fine, but then his bowel movements gave in to the beer from the night before and it was just before twelve and my father was going to work. "Thank god." I thought, and I signaled my bf that he could go to the bathroom.
But **NO**. Because **5 SECONDS** after my father had left, my mother enters the house all cheery. My boyfriend cringed, so I just gave him a bag and fetched him some toilet paper and I tried so much not to laugh/die of mortification while I chatted with my mother. She just had a free period (she's a teacher), so she left after half an hour and so I could finally check on my bf.
I expected the room to smell badly, but what I didn't expect was that he had to piss mid-crap and of course the bag leaked as well, so that left a huge stain, which thank god was on the upper floor so nobody would ever have seen it. I was cool with it (I put him in that fucking situation), just told him to put the bag into the trash can himself, we had breakfast and he left. I finally got rid of the smell and the stain like a week later. My parents never found out.
We are now together three years.
** Hid BF in my room while parents were home, BF crapped and pissed into a leaking bag at the same time.**
EDIT: Spelling etc
I'm glad I'm not the only, but I've chalked it up to a taste thing. I listen to the music for the music, lyrics take a back seat as I hear the vocalist as another instrument. I think it's about what the individual is listening for. My sister picks up song lyrics VERY quickly from songs I've heard for years that had never really sunk in, but she can't stand instrumentals or classical music because they don't have lyrics (she doesn't even like guitar solos!). Needless to say our tastes differ greatly, but I think it's insight into the way people like yourself and me listen to music. Also, you may want to cross-post this over to [/r/music](/r/music) for some more discussion.

EDIT: I hate to be a dork, but: first top comment! Upvotes all around!
&gt;*She is part of a "spiritual family" that hug each other a lot, say they love each other a lot, and spend a lot of time laughing.
&gt;*She claims to know who the anti-Christ is, and named a real person.
&gt;*She claims to know when the end of days is coming
&gt;*She speaks of someone she knows going to the Congo, and he's going to "blow them up! in a big bomb of glory" or something similar.
&gt;*She claims to be able to prophesize over people, or "know" things about them
&gt;*She has visions
The second and third I'd definitely red flag as a cult. The Bible makes is explicitly clear that the end days are not known except by God himself. Sounds like one of those groups that are obsessed with the End Times. 
The fourth one is just wtf. No church uses that kind of language. Not to mention it's a little concerning. Maybe you should call the Feds?
 yeah she's in a cult 
Ah, but to someone with a positive attitude that will not necessarily be something that gets you down. Being happy with the fond memories you have, and realising shit could have been so much worse can really make me glad to be alive and to have lived the way I have lived so far. 
 good memories &gt; bad memories
By the way, the people at your deathbed, being happy to be there in your final moments, will be worth a lot to you. And they, at that very moment, will not be memories. 
Related: [This passage]( from The Name Of The Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss, includes that sentiment and expands upon it. His writing style doesn't lend itself to single sentences, but the is thus:
"Suddenly the story she tells herself in her own head changes. She transforms. She isn't *seen as beautiful.* She is *beautiful, seen.*"
Here is my reasoning. 
If it is a product I want to use it should be available ad free and in an appropriate own able medium. If it isn't I'll download. 
I download loads of films cause it's faster than ripping my DVD (with menus and ads) at times or I'll download higher quality music since I only own the vinyl. Or finally I pay almost 200/month for phone Internet and cable but I don't have time to watch what I want when it's on. I don't have a DVR because they are so restrictive so I download. 
By a rule I nearly always buy what I download. The download is just for convince or because specific format is not available for purchase. 
Example.
 Doctor Who and Sherlock on TV is ruined by commercials being place in US format and cutting 2-3 min of show. I always buy the DVD or BD but I want to watch when it's on so I download weekly. 
I download my BD films cause I have no BD player on my laptop and I have no faith in the "digital downloads" they seem like a scam an I can't trust the studio to deliver a permanent version. 
TL;DR
If it isn available to me to purchase in a
Reasonable format I will download. Or if I want a digital version for convenience 
this is a good read about Health care in the 1960's: 
It's bacically a look at our government's health care system during the 1960's where 70% of US population was covered, but only 1/2 of the elderly did. You also need to remember that this was also the time of unions &amp; unemployment was hoovering around 5%. But Ron Paul was an affluent white male living in the South.
"There was "another America": 40 to 50 million citizens who were poor, who lacked adequate medical care, and who were "socially invisible" to
the majority of the population. Within this poverty-stricken group were more than 8 million of the 18 million Americans who were 65 years of age and over, suffering from a "downward spiral" of sickness and isolation."
tl; dr: Ron Paul was wrong, there was almost 1/3 of US population w/ out coverage &amp; the majority of elderly w/out coverage.
Well, I already decided, personally, to not buy a damn thing until shit changes. I will support this through and through, but we need a better campaign than this. 
If someone was trying to organize a "NO LADIES FUCK COLOR_THINE_FATE IN MARCH" campaign, with the caveat that in April, all the ladies will come and fuck me, I would be like, "....Okay. Deal."
If you're going to half-ass an already mildly lazy internet protest, then you should just not do anything at all.
However, that said, make a banner that doesn't include a cop-out four weeks in, and I will go Gung Ho with it.
My only exception is Diablo 3. If that comes out, it's going immediately in my mouth. This is something I promised 15-year-old-me, so that's just going to happen. But I'm already boycotting the rest of the bullshit. 
**** I like the thought, but don't cap it at a month. That's pussy talk. As [klxz79 said]( if you're gonna hold a protest, you have to hold it **until shit changes**, otherwise nothing will change.
"**...such as Megaupload under allegations of 'piracy' and 'conspiracy' the time has come to take a stand against...**"
It seems the author wants to deny the fact piracy is a huge amount of revenue for Megaupload. So why would we boycot the music, film and media companies for that? Because it is true: the owners of Megaupload have a business model that lives on pirated content.
I'm all against SOPA and PIPA, and I have used Megaupload for non-legal reasons, but do people really want to deny that Megaupload is a huge source of piracy?
**Juridically**, the government is wrong and shouldn't have taken down this site.
But **ethically**, we all know the main use of this site.
***
Although I disagree with the situation wherein the site has been taken down (just like the author does),
I don't agree with that we should neglect the fact piracy is a huge problem within this site.
Or you might realise you dont actually need to buy so much crap and when April rolls round you wont rush out to buy shitloads of DVDs or whatever.
I think, generally, this is a good idea.
Also, what about targeting one studio (chosen at random somehow, but one of the 'big 6') and boycotting everything they produce?
I could definitely go for a month without buying any new media at all and I think it would hurt them enough to make a point. 
Example:
I have 513 days worth of music according to iTunes, and the majority of that (90%) is legal. 
I go to the cinema about 4 times a month.
I go to at least 1 gig a month. 
I buy DVDs and BRDs regularly (maybe 3-4 a month)
I have a subscription to Love Film (UK Netflix). 
I'm trying to work out my monthly spending here. I'd say roughly $80-$100 (roughly £65) all in. 
My point is I put money into these industries. We all do.
Lets say for every person who participates, we suck roughly $50 from the industry over 1 month.
If it's anywhere near as successful as the protests on the 18th, that would be be very significant.
The Movie and Music industries seem to have completely forgotten that the people they are trying to put the clamps on are the consumers of their products. If we stop consuming they are screwed.
Lets do it.
Without our continued support the Movie and Music industries wouldn't exist. Lets remind them of this.
Interesting childhood. My stepdad was an unfulfilled community college professor who freelanced doing surveys of local wildlife and served as a wildlife rehabilitator. He started up a local environmental group when such things were still terribly controversial; my little brother and I were both champions of the cause. Eventually, a family friend would start up a sea turtle hospital, which he and I volunteered at for a time. He then took a position in the South Pacific, and took us family along for the ride. It went okay.

Ok so first off chances are the 95% of your classmates aren't jerks, and they probably find those guy's obnoxious when they bully people. But since you are the quiet kid your class mates probably don't know you enough for them to self justify sticking their necks out to defend you. However, you can use your reserved nature to your advantage, and turn the situation around on them to make them self conscious about their actions.  They won't care if you ask them to stop because you hate it, because they don't respect you. But if you can put the respect from their observing peers into play, shit get;s real. So,
if they engage in a kind of longer segment of bullying that **they initiate**; say this loud enough so other people near by can hear. Note: It's best if they are people that are in your class, that at least recognize you even if only as the quiet one.  
   
Come on just stop. For God's sake you are embarrassing your self.  Did you ever stop for a second to consider the person you chose to bully? Do you really think anyone here respects you for taunting the quiet, and shy kid. Like that the people who are witnessing this are thinking,"yeah you go [insert bully name], that kid totally *is* a faggot!" You are *not* the hero in this situation it is just embarrassing.  
Disclaimer: This will only work if most people have a neutral or good opinion of you. So if you are quiet because you are awkward, go for it. But if you are quiet because most people you talk to seem irritated by you, then I would go with a different route.  
 More likely than not, no one is in support of these bullies. Pointing that they just look like jerks making fun of the quiet kid is probably going to get them to stop. Involving the respect of their peers makes your request to stop a lot more weighty.
Yep, initially I got in contact with the local Ron Paul enthusiasts. I went to the initial ground game meetup in December and got to know a few of the folks, and learned how to get a list of Republican Super-Voters in the area (super-voters are essentially people who reliably vote, including primary elections). 
Rule #1 of Ron Paul Ground Game is **OWN YOUR PRECINCT**. Search Facebook for a Ron Paul group in your area; find out how to get a list of super-voters for your precinct. If your group is fairly well organized, there's probably someone with a big stack of Super Brochures waiting for an ambitious Paulite to canvass their area with them. If not, you can always buy them yourself for cheap: [
Once you have the super brochures and a list of super voters, you're good to go. I picked up a few things at Staples to help look semi-professional: clipboard with storage container (to hold bumper stickers and extra brochures) and name tag stickers. When I go out I clean myself up, wear my local football team's polo and jeans, I slap the "*Hello My Name is*" sticker on and start knocking on doors.
My door routine is pretty straightforward and a matter of personal preference, but you want to keep it brief. If I knock on a door and they answer, I go with "Hi, I'm with the Republican party and we're going around the neighborhood, encouraging everyone to vote for Doctor Ron Paul on or before January 31st.". Sometimes, if the vibe is right, I mention that I'm stopping by because they are a SUPER VOTER! :D
I talk to everyone I see outside, whether they are on my list or not, because they are very approachable. I find that a simple, "any Republicans in the house?" works well for an intro.
** get involved, buy or find some [Super Brochures]( your Super-Voter list, and get out there! For Liberty!!** 
Page 1 of 6? please..
It's all about **the moment**. You make it sound like this is a binary issue: either she likes you or she doesn't. But let's compare the two encounters:
At the house party, alcohol was flowing, there was a fun atmosphere, you're both enjoying yourselves. Key point: *alcohol*. Her inhibitions are lowered. Don't think I'm saying she only finds you attractive when she's wasted, just put yourself in the frame of mind of being drunk and wanting to get laid. You're going to be more proactive in the getting-into-bed part.
Now compare the next meeting. Biggest red flag is this: 
&gt;she was talking and I went in for the spit swap. 
First of all a spit swap sounds horrible, but that's not the main reason I zoned in on this. **She was talking**. You don't kiss a girl for the first time when she's midway through a conversation. Were you listening to what she was talking about at the time? Was she completely unprepared for it? If so then of course she'll instinctively back away. 
Ever play The Sims, where people have green bars that fill up indicating their current mood? Picture her with a 'horniness' bar. At the house party that bar was steadily increasing throughout the night until it was max. When you went out for a drink with just the two of you, you have to provide as much positive energy as that entire party all by yourself for the green bar to fill the same amount. And moving in for a kiss when her bar is only half full and she's talking? Minus 40 points. Looking back on my good/bad first kisses, here's my checklist:
* Always be comfortable with each other's touch before moving in for a first kiss. If your arms are already around each other the kiss comes naturally. Much better than standing 3 feet apart then BAM ZOOM IN I'M COMING AT YOU
* Is she genuinely interested in you? Talking and being 'friends' is *not* genuine interest. Look for extended eye contact, laughing at your jokes even when they're terrible, that kind of thing.
* How much are you talking, and how much is she talking? Try reaching a point in conversation where you naturally stop talking and look at her. If she doesn't say anything, or just awkwardly says "Soooo..." then kiss her. If she's looking away and brings up her aunt's german classes after a few moments of silence, then you're not kissing anytime soon.

**It's not about whether or not she likes you, it's about whether or not she wants you in that specific moment in time.**
You might get better advice by trying out /r/Seduction, give it a whirl.
Here's my advice on exhaust system purchasing. 
1. Make sure you listen to an actual car with the system you are considering. Recordings online can be incredibly deceptive. The way a system sounds with a $10 microphone 6 inches from the tail pipe on YouTube may be vastly different than in real life.  If at all possible drive/ride in the car as well. What sounds awesome on start up in a parking lot, might annoy the hell out of you cruising down a quiet interstate at 75mph. The high RPM range on a lot of systems sounds like swarm of weedwhacker wielding bees is chasing you. With a convertible, this is probably even more important if you ever put the top down. 
2. Its your car, your money, so get what you like and tell the world to STFU. That being said, mods only for the sake of appearance, sounds, lights, etc. is almost the textbook definition of rice. So don't be surprised if you get some grief about your decision especially from track car type guys. 
3. Also, nothing annoys neighbors more than the guy with the loud VRRRROOMAPBABAAAAAA car driving thru the neighbor hood, it just comes across as dickish and teenager like. So if that's not your general attitude, you might think twice about turning a nice understated BMW into a race car. 
 Tip #1 is 10x more important than the rest. - Listen to a real car, not youtube.
Not tech support but I did debit card fraud victim support for a bank once. I would have loved to trade my crazies for IT crazies any day.
Successful Small Business owner calls. "I have fraud on my account, there is 4,000 dollars missing out of the company account."
Me: Okay well I can check for debit card fraud, what is the card number?
Business Owner: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Me: Okay I have to verify you to the account (Questions are asked)
BO: (Questions are answered)
Me: Alright I'm now going to read over your recent transactions let me know if these are yours or not. (Reads transactions)
BO: Those are all mine, that and they don't explain why my account is so low.
Me: I see another card on the account lets check it.
BO: I Don't have another card on the account.
Me: Says you do here, ending in XXXX with the name (redacted) on it.
BO: That's my business partner I had his card turned off after he spent (some stupidly large amount on something stupid)
Me: Looks like his card is still active, would you like me to read the transactions there are recent purchases here.
BO: WHAT... Shit, yes.
Me: (Reads transactions)
BO: WHAT NO HE DID WHAT SPENT WHAT ON WHAT!.... Excuse me (sound of phone setting down, footsteps storming away from the phone, extremely loud noise *BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG* unintelligible background grumbling from BO *BANG BANG BANG*)
Me: *WTF face not sure if punching a wall, slamming a door, or firing a gun*
BO: (unintelligible female voice in background conversing with BO... footsteps return to the phone) Yea I'm back okay what else as he done.
Me: *retains composure* (reads more transactions)
BO: OH WHAT THE FUCK GODDAMNIT HOLD ON REAL QUICK (Sets his phone down and mutes it, does not return for 5-10 minutes)
Me: (Explains the call I'm on to co-wokers while on hold, they are terrified and amazed at the same time.)
BO: (Returns) Okay yea sorry about that, just had to take care of something
Me: (retains composure and finishes going over transactions,  none of which are approved) Okay sir, well I'm going to get you over to our claims department I assure you his card is now deactivated and closed it can not be reopened. (transfers to claims so he can try and get his money back, gets up and tells manager about this insane call)
I think he killed his business partner.

Not sure if anyone will be able to help me, but ive been looking for it for about 3 years. Ok so there was this amateur porn video, i believe it was shot in night vision(green with glowing eyes stuff) and its this girl about to give a blowjob to 2 guys simultaneously. So she begins to do the deed with a member in each hand, and out of nowhere she decides to go "hey you guys can totally kiss each other" and begins to touch the tips of each member together. I started busting up laughing. The guys in the video are like "stop it, dont do that" she thought it was the cutest thing and continued to play tips with both members. I laughed my ass off for so long. 
Girl gives bj to two guys and plays tips with their members. 
thread is so fucking relevant, new and exciting, and pretty damn legit (and/or 'real') for just seeing the title and the post. 
Hotshotgg started the trend, just like Jiji says "do da damagez" and so on,
One time I was riding my roommates longboard to my outdoor ecology class.  I hit a rock, ended up falling and sprained my ankle and then hobbling over to the curb to assess the situation, but when I got to the curb I sat down in dog shit.  A mexican guy offered to give me a ride home, most embarrassing thing that has happened to me.  
  I feel ya bro. 
Ya now what? It is a horrible idea for a tattoo and a horrible franchise to put on your body (IMO). But you know what else?
That doesn't change the fact that this bad ass old lady got a full fucking back tattoo of whatever the hell she wanted. Not only that, but kudos to the artist cause that's a damn good looking tattoo. The trees in the back ground look a-fucking-mazing.
*** Yeah, Twilight sucks, but it doesn't change the fact that this tatted up ol' bird got a full back and was smart enough to find a good artist to do it. GO GRANMA.

I can never understand this about our society. Why do we dig into someones personal lives and make that the basis for a decision? Look at Benjamin Franklin, he had a few scrapes in his love affairs yet he is still considered one of the greatest men in our history. And I know this next example has been used on more than one occasion but bear with me here.
Based solely on the following information which one of the following would you elect as a leading member of your government?
* Candidate A: Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. had two mistresses. he also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.
* Candidate B: Kicked out of office twice, rises from bed at 11am, used opium in college and drinks champagne, brandy, and whiskey to excess every day.
* Candidate C: A decorated war hero. vegetarian, doesn't smoke or drink, and hasn't had any extramarital affairs
Candidate A is Theodore Roosevelt, B is Winston Churchill and C is Adolph Hitler.
We know who each of the candidates are but does there personal life really reflect what they will do in office? Roosevelt and Churchill are both considered great men of the 20th century despite their unfavorable backgrounds. Teddy was considered a progressive era leader who introduced the revolutionary square deal, Churchill stopped appeasement, made a firm stand against the Nazi's, and led the nation through D-Day to VE day. They did all that despite their private lives. Hitler, despite his seemingly noble and honor filled background (yes, I know about the draft and art school issues) committed many atrocities during his time as leader of the Third Reich.
Don't judge a book by its cover
I realize I'm a bit late with this, but instead of trying to get your girlfriend to cater specifically to your tastes in music, why not try to enjoy some of her music as well? I understand that it's all personal preference, but once you lose the "oh it's too mainstream for me" hipster attitude with it, it can be much more enjoyable even if it is on the radio. Sure, the radio plays a lot of garbage, but much in the same way she's trying to get into your music, it wouldn't be fair to dis her tastes and dismiss them as being in poor taste. Some people geek out on rock, some geek out on industrial, some geek out with punk, some classical. If you haven't heard it yet, the best approach is to listen with an open mind and just try to enjoy your time with her, regardless of tastes. If she can accept you for your tastes, it would only be fair to do the same in return. Not that you can't at least feel comfortable listening to what you enjoy around her. Some good gateway bands for me happened to be a little more on the industrial rock or metal side, just to ease into it. Stabbing Westward, Manson, Rammstein, Turmion Kätilöt, Rob Zombie, Depeche Mode, Hocico, MSI, stuff like that... that all got me to open my mind up to the general world of electronic, metal, rock, punk, pop and even Bolliwood music when my tastes were catered primarily to rap. But that person has to want to change, they can't be forced. And it can't be guaranteed that she'll actually like it, only appreciate the fact that it's something new to her. I'm not knocking you, but remember that all mainstream bands and artists had to start somewhere and not everyone became popular by having a pretty image. If it weren't for shitty pop music, it's very unlikely that most people would even have started listening to music or even had the influences to branch out into other styles.
open up your own tastes as well, show her you're willing to give her music a chance and it's almost 100% likely that she'll get into your music too. The experience becomes so much more enjoyable and she might just turn you on to something you might never have liked as well.
I have the Diztronic Rev 3 case and it is a great case! Definitely worth the ~$9.00 on Amazon.
This case is made of TPU, which I much prefer over Silicone. This is not tacky and sticky like Silicone... so it does not collect pocket lint or dust off of surfaces. It is also easy to slide out of your pocket and does not get stuck!
The Diztronic Rev 3 has great cutouts for buttons, microphones, and speakers. It provides great protection and looks nice on the device. It also does not add much bulk. 
All of that being said, TPU is not exactly *"grippy"*. It provides a nice grip when being held and feels sturdier and less slippery than a Galaxy Nexus... but it is not sticky, as I mentioned earlier, like silicone. This means that the device will still slide on a table or surface to some extent.
---
*** as a Diztronic Rev 3 owner, I highly recommend this case! I absolutely hate phone cases but this matte finish is nice and the glossy trim around the screen fits in nicely. Protective but not bulky! Should also fit the extended battery.
To be fair, double agent wasn't nearly as bad of sequel as this was. Albeit it was the game that started to put in useless plots surrounding Sam when the whole series was meant to be his adventures, not his steep fall into depression over everything. I mean at least it still had spy versus mercenary.
The thing that kills me is it seems that every game that had a strong running in the niche market always becomes one of two games. Third person it becomes gears of war, and first person it becomes call of duty. (I don't mean in any way an insult to either series, I myself love them.) I understand that these games thrived because of the technology at the time as technology progresses the games of these lesser technologies fades away.
I had the same discussion a while back that this is a majority versus minority and the market reflects these choices, but it never takes away from the feel of pretty much betrayal. (I know that this is irrational as these are merely games made by companies, and as such the prime directive is to gain mass quantities of currency.) 
SHIT SUCKS YO! 
The priest/pastor has done just what you have done he has found meaning for his life. It is based on things not seen, but that is not unusual human beings believe in unseen things all the time. God is like Mathematics an imagined perfection. Science is a different way of perceiving the universe it produces knowledge of how to manipulate or exploit existence. It is seen as superior to religious faith. It isn't that religion cannot give meaning to life it is just not as fruitful a pursuit as science.
This is why I see no benefit in debating theists they are not wrong for understanding what they do. Nor is the atheist wrong in their understanding. 
We see things diffeently.
Science and Religion both can do great harm if misused. From an historical perspective we tend to focus on the harm of relgion and why not there is a rich history of stupidity performed by man in the name of God. Science has only been around a few hundred years and yet it has given us Saran Gas and thermonuclear bombs. It has enabled 1 man to kill hundreds of thousands at once if not more. Religion never put that much power in the hands of one man. (Not even the Pope).
For some people religion is easier to understand and follow. Religion is tolerant of imperfect understanding. Science is a harder path requiring rigorous and thorough understanding. There are bad scientists to be sure but it is much harder to fake an understanding of science rather than a fake understanding of religion. 
A true man of God accepts it all and is above doctrine and scripture but this type of understanding is rare. One of the greatest sayings I ever heard when I studied religion was "The best way (form) to worship God is every way (form)." The point of all religion is to get to the transcendent state where you experience the peace and contentment of a life well lived. When people of religion argue about the different practices or run around judging heretics they are being fools silly monkeys. So atheists who criticize theists are mainly criticizing those with an incomplete understanding of religion. They criticize the stupidity and hypocrisy of ignorant practitioners. They do not know the truly good theists who are humble and generous and strive to live up to their vision of a good life in service to their "God". These people do not run megachurches they may not even worship in a church synagogue or temple. They are quiet followers for the most part. And they do not hate or pity atheists or anyone else for that matter. They wish everyone could come to the understanding that we are all in this together and should work together to make life better. 
Their path to understanding is hard it is easy to stumble along the way. Science allows us to understand reality with rigorous discipline. It doesn't try and answer the unknowable questions but attempts to understand what is. 
 Don't be a hater there are sincere theists in the world.
I can assure you I am not a troll. I am a liberal on most issues. I am for progressive taxation, against the death penalty, pro-choice, pro public education, etc. I was against the War in Iraq, but in favor of the War in Afghanistan (I saw the Afghani government as one that had acted to abet the terrorist sects involved with the attacks of September 11th). 
I am a law student; I am the son of a life-long public defender with a healthy fear of police corruption. However, I also pride myself on thinking for myself and believe in respecting others until they give me reason not to. I have not read your arguments, because I want to give you my pre and post reading opinion. Pre-reading: I have seen no logical arguments about why TSA measures are unnecessary. I consider the fact that the heads of the TSA are experts on safety and counter-terrorism to be a prima facie case in favor of the measures they introduce. It is certainly possible to argue against their measures, but the simple lack of successful attacks since 9/11 does not imply that there were no attempts nor does it imply whether or not the TSA measures were responsible for thwarting or deterring attempts. I am not in any way an expert on security measures. I'm simply not particularly interested in them and spend most of my time reading about elections, education policy, the death penalty, history, and law.
Reading post now.
1. If the liquid was explosive, I suspect they would detain and interrogate you. However, even if they just let you throw it out, that is a marginal improvement over allowing you to bring it on board.
2. This is a valid point that I had not previously considered. I hope that it is true and think it *probably* is.
3. What was the status of the cockpits before? What changes were made? 
4. The only danger there would be the ability of a would-be terrorist to hijack the plane using the bomb as a threat and claiming only to be seeking ransom (similar to the 9/11 attacks).
My conclusion is that I understand the arguments against TSA measures slightly better, but I do not think that #1 is supported (though would like a citation). I see TSA measures as a way to thwart terrorist attacks, a way to deter, and a potential way to detain terrorist suspects.
I do not have a response to #4 about "why a plane." I think you're right about the possibility of any crowded area. However, I also think that just because it could happen elsewhere and we don't have security there is not conclusive that we should not have airport security. Demand for visiting a mall is more elastic than demand for using an airport and would decrease more due to security measures.
Thank you for the food for thought. I am now more informed and understand the opposing viewpoint better. I have been somewhat persuaded to soften an already partly soft pro-TSA stance.
 I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I kinda liked the part where he said: 
&gt; When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, **this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July**. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.

&gt; Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. **We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition**; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury— it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
A College Board Report entitled "Trends in College Pricing 2011" basically said that **although published tuition rates are going up, net tuition rates (the amount people actually pay on average) are staying the same or going down**.
This is largely because of things like grants and subsidies. The only people actually paying the published tuition rates are the ones who can afford it.
**Net tuition rates have reached this plateau where more financial aid won't change much.** It'll basically just lead to higher published tuition rates.
**Obama seems to realize this and that the problem is interest rates. I thank him for this.**
**Obama realizes that more subsidies tuition isn't the answer. The answer is lower interest rates.**
Sure, we have it. We are choosing to invest it elsewhere because we don't place clean energy high on our list of priorities. The idea that the US could ever run out of money is incorrect, but that fairly new and complicated economic thinking that I wouldn't be able to explain properly. I can never be a teacher.
Why is there no button?
I used them to get Eye of the North at a decent price, and had no problem at all.
My friend however, didn't receive his code for the trilogy, but I believe he got a refund from them. He is kind of a screw up sometimes so maybe he messed up the process. He ended up having to get it from Steam.
** worked for me, not for my friend.**
Let me share a story:
During high school they invited the senior class into the auditorium to vote on things like "best dressed," "Most likely to succeed," etc. We all had our voting sheets and had to sit quietly and fill them out.  I looked around and saw that I had a pretty decently sized group of friends sitting by me - about 10 people. I said "Ok, who do we want to be best dressed?" Together we 10 decided who got what. (I claimed "Most likely to succeed" for myself.)  Just voting as a bloc of 10 made sure we overruled the scattered votes of the general populace.
I guess my point is this: if we determine to help eachother be successful in the currently disorganized / scattered self publishing market, we will all benefit.
I don't know if we could simply use r/selfpublish to mobilize or if we'd need to set up something like r/writerscoalition or similar. 
I imagine we could base the imprints on the genres sought by our membership. No need to create the "Noir" imprint till I get my hardboiled book finished, you know?  
 Count me in. Where should we organize?
Honestly mate, have you been out there. We try, we try bloody hard but it's so damn depressing trying to help these people who just destroy themselves. Give them more money and they spend it all on booze. We put up some overnight shelters in the territory and that just means they don't care about coming back to their families after getting black-out drunk - they just crash there and expect to get everything given to them.
They DO get aid, healthcare, loads of support. Plenty of opportunities for education if the parents would just bring their kids to school. Our next plan of action is to employ people to go around to all of their houses and take the kids to school instead... it's a shame we have to go that far.
I do want the situation to get better, we *all* do. I don't think that Medowband is necessarily racist, it sounds like he's just given up hope on them. My aunt is the head of a government commission on aboriginal rights and equality - she hates her job now because she doesn't believe that anything can be changed unless the government gets much tougher on aboriginals (political suicide). My cousin works as a vet in northern Queensland. She went in wanting to turn life there around, and now thinks that it is a hopeless endeavour.
It is not a simple issue. It is not like we are neglecting them - indeed, it is perfectly easy for them to live completely off welfare checks. I believe that unless there is a motivation for aboriginals to contribute to work, more money given towards them is more harm than good.
These issues are not simple, do not mistake that point. It is not a simple back/white issue the circlejerk of SRS makes it out to be. You don't see this because any opposing viewpoints are censored there. I'm telling you this so you can see that.
No  I think that it is important that you read all of this.
Hey, I'm new to the subreddit and I thought I'd clarify this. I hear this argument a lot, but in reality the construct of marriage only marginally includes religion, although the devout of any religion can impose their beliefs onto their marriage.
Let's begin with the purpose/definition of marriage. Marriage is a union between a *virile* man and a *fertile* woman for the purpose of creating legitimate (biologically their own) heirs to a married couple's property, titles, and lineage. Furthermore, it exists to create a permanent familial safety net between the man and woman after the woman has passed her fertile years or after one of them has died.
It is for this reason that if a man or woman is found to be impotent/infertile, one or both of them can request that the marriage be  legally annulled.
Marriage is literally a contract for *biological reproduction and property inheritance.* If a couple can't conceive a child - their own child - then according to the definition of marriage they really have no business getting married. 
I must really emphasize here that marriage is *not* for those seeking companionship, romance, or love. All of these are tertiary concerns to the primary purpose of marriage. Though they may come in time or be related, they are not the real deal, so to speak.
So to continue along this logical route, two men cannot produce heirs, and until modern technology advances a little more, two women cannot produce heirs either. Similarly, a postmenopausal woman or an impotent man have no business entering marriage contracts unless they have property they would like to transmit to someone else's lineage.
This is why same-sex marriage has never been legal, even before the sweep of the Abrahamic religions. However, the times are a-changing and some people in the US no longer view marriage as a contractual obligation for baby-time; eventually same sex marriage may be legal - but then it would just be a re-purposed vestige that wouldn't really be marriage anymore.
This explains why even plenty of atheists don't support same sex marriage. I hope this makes sense to you.
 money and babies.

you're so fucking mad. yeah how dare i educate my fellow gamer about problems that are extremely common among people who spend a lot of time sitting (anterior pelvic tilt). such pseudo-intellectualism, someone with a bio B.S. degree who has done a ton of research for self-fitness purposes actually providing the correct terminology in case anyone wants to google it and learn more. 
please shut up. if you think my original post was anything more than a 5-second joke, you need to stop projecting whatever fucked up ideas you have. not everyone takes the internet as seriously as you.
finally, everything i said i said with the confidence of having researched the subject for over the past two years on my own in addition to whatever basic knowledge i acquired in school. i hate pseudo-science, i and hate people like you for not knowing the difference between what's legit and what's not. a 10-second google of Anterior Pelvic Tilt would've educated you that what I am talking about is not in any way bogus, and is one of the most increasingly big problems in sedentary lifestyle first-world countries.

The "simple English" in this graphic is terribly simplistic and misleading.  Worse, some of the figures appear to be false.
First of all, since when is the average federal tax rate 40% for the 99%?  This is blatantly untrue.  The top 1% have an income tax rate of approximately 25%, while the top 5% have an average income tax rate of approximately 16%.  Yes, the tax structure is complicated.
Income tax comprises only 40%-45% of federal income.  The top 20% produce about 3/4 of all income tax revenue and the top 1% produce about 1/4.
Payroll taxes comprise about 35% of federal income and the top 1% certainly contributes far less to this segment (payroll taxes are capped on income over about $110,000), though I don't have any specific figures.  I'd appreciate if someone could shed some light on this.
The remaining ~ 15% of federal income comes from corporate income tax and excise taxes.
Saying and "Mom's Household Contribution" and "Dad's Household Contribution" suggests that Mom contributes 40% of the household's total revenue and Dad contributes only 15%.  
Assuming your numbers are correct (they're not),
2033910000000 is the amount Dad contributes
408240000000 is the amount Mom contributes,
which would then suggest that Mom is not pulling her weight, which is probably not the message you're trying to get across.
 this graphic is misleading at best and dishonest at worst.
Well, sort of. You can't see how someone answered a question on OKC unless you have also answered it. And you can't change your answer within 24 hours of answering or changing. And you can only see questions they've marked as public. It would work *ok*, until the first date probably. The bottom line really is meeting people and actually creating your own opinion about them can't be replaced by a questionnaire. 
It takes 24 hours minimum to game OKC and then you only get as much as they had marked public. 
Answer all the questions one day, find someone with most of their answers public, then come back the next day and match theirs.  Both situations are still the same, someone is faking interest and deceiving the other, and it will probably fall apart when they actually get together.
People will find a way to act out their delusions in whatever system.
You need to take all University rankings lists with a grain of salt, be they the 'best in the US', 'best in Europe' or even 'best in the world'. You really need to put some research into which university you want to apply to, because there are a lot of very good, relatively unknown universities out there.
It's important to understand the criteria by which these lists are made and how they translate into good BSc, MSc or PhD programs. For instance, there is an incredible amount of universities out there with extremely good undergraduate programs, while there are way fewer universities with 'world class' PhD programs in any specific field.
Some universities also have extremely good faculties in some fields, while they are lagging far behind in others. This isn't unusual with many smaller universities. These kind of universities may not be high ranked overall, even though several of their faculties are extremely good.
You also need to base which university you want to apply to on the kind of degree you're looking to get. If you are only applying for a BSc degree, you can be much less picky than if you are applying for an MSc program. The same applies when you're looking for a university to take your PhD at.
Over here it isn't out of the ordinary to take your BSc degree at a small, local university, then apply for an MSc program at a larger, more well known university and then finally applying to take your PhD at the best university you can think of. As an example, two of my friends took their BSc at the University of Iceland, then took their MSc at Chalmer's University and finally took their PhD at ETH.
***
If you're looking for a university to join, you should never just open up 'University Rankings' lists and apply to all of the universities you see at the top. It's honestly not as simple as 'top ranked university = best choice for me'. Ultimately, all it might wind up doing is forcing you to pay much more for your education than you truly need to.
While I agree with the notion of making college cheaper; this will not help. It may very well make it worse. I'm fairly certain that colleges don't *know* how to improve value, especially not with the fine examples of the places I've gone to.
This will do nothing but cause colleges to tank their budget and spike tuition as more people scurry off to the colleges who haven't died out, thus reducing the number of college students by just making it impossible for some to get into school.
This bill does nothing to help students; I propose a new bill: Free College Education. Because we're promised Free Education but we don't actually have it anymore. WTF America?
I don't mean that government pays for books, I mean that tuition and other student fees are covered so long as you don't dick around in college (earning F's automatically drops your eligibility for aid, but only to a certain extent. Redoing the class and passing with a B or better removes the F). FAFSA and similar methods just don't cut it for universities.

 I don't like Obama's idea.
I can't answer the improvement from 2011-2012 for the X9 stuff from SRAM, but I can tell you that I have had really good luck with SRAM. I've had a few SRAM derailleurs and shifters, front and rear, and I've liked them all with no problems.
Shifters are up to you, but will dictate what you run for a derailleur. I haven't liked Shimano's shifters and I've enjoyed the SRAM shifters, (X0, X9, X7) over the years.
Because you're running a 1x9 or 1x10 setup, you'll use a short cage derailleur. If you had a wider spread, like 11-36, you'd probably need medium cage. There are charts that talk about chain wrap and cage size, but if you're on a DH bike with an 11-26 it's shorty all the way. I'm also assuming your running a normal sized front ring (34-38 tooth).
Honestly, you can't go wrong with either brand as it's mostly personal preference. My vote goes to SRAM X9 because it's cheaper but performs like a champ.
*edit-  poke around some sram and shimano shit at your LBS and figure out what feels best and fits your budget.
&gt; people who are not sexually attractive?
Circular logic, but I'll bite.
Sexual attraction in human beings occurs on a very wide spectrum, a bafflingly wide one if you include sexual paraphilias (better known as fetishes).
There are certainly people out there who prefer women whose body fat percentage is a risk to their health - otherwise the "BBW" fetish would not exist.
But to call heavier women **objectively unattractive** is to ignore the fact that there are some people who would prefer them over other types of women.
- beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   And no, I'm not really a chubby chaser, although to me being able to live with someone's personality is more important than their looks - I can't fucking stand most people, and we're all going to be ugly when we're older anyway.
Everytime I speak up in class I always get people upset with me - it's not my fault that the facts disprove the teacher, or that I just happen to retain obscure shit like that...
It really isn't...
 my first name is Russell and this shit is the story of my life.
I had a guy negotiate a price with me that was decent. Then I asked him when he wanted to get it. Asshole then tells me, "when I get the money". From now on, I use eBay to sell my stuff.

When the barley is turned into malt to be distilled, it is basically roasted over a fire. Many regions in Scotland have traditionally dried it out over a fire made of peat, which is just a very flammable type of soil found in wet, grassy regions in the north of the UK among other places. 
This malting process imparts a smokey flavour into the whisky, and depending on whether the fire was made of peat (and how long it was roasting over this peated fire, as sometimes it will be dried on both a peated and non-peated fire) the amount of peat and smoke that is noticeable will vary.
For me, the easiest way to show someone has always been to open a bottle of Laphroiag 10 and Talisker 10 and nose/taste them side by side to get a feel for the clear distinction between peat and smoke respectively. Then pick up a bottle of Jura Superstition or Bunnahabhain and a bottle of Highland Park or Springbank and try and pick out the separate flavours where they are slightly more subtle and one may only be slightly stronger than the other.
peat = soil. 
Firstly, I disagree with everyone's opinion that FFVIII had a good scenario. No, for me, it freaking sucked. Yeah, it sucked ass. I liked the Laguna stuff, but, really? A sorceress? All that sorceress mumbo-jumbo ruined it for me. IMO the scenario was ffviii's weak point, feel free to disagree with me though. On the other hand, ffix had a better scenario, and though it's unrelated (due to the nature of the thread), better scenery, characters, gameplay, music, chocobos etc, though I still think 6 and 7 are better.
Best RPG scenario:
I'm going to go back a little for the first title (it's not a well-known game).  This is not a list featuring my favourite to the least favourite, I'm just mentioning some titles that you may or may not have played/heard of.
1.Vandal Hearts II. It puts Final Fantasy Tactics to shame (it's a strategy RPG). Even though FFT had better gameplay, VHII has an awesome scenario that's not for little kids, involving politics, magic and schemes to take over the throne in a medieval setting like Tactics Ogre.
2.Suikoden II. One of the best games evar, surpassing the original. I'm not going to say anything more, you probably know the game.
3.Chrono Cross. Personally, I like chrono cross better than chrono trigger. I think Chrono Trigger has too much of a sentimental value to older RPgamers, so they tend to overesell it. CT is one of my favourite games, but I prefer CC, that's all I'm saying.
4.Legend of Dragoon. Now it's my turn to get sentimental. Oh my God, how much I love this game! I mean, oh.my.god.
5.PLanescape torment, followed by the Baldur's Gate series. Not much to say.
6.Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2 Innnocent Sin and Eternal Punishment. Dude. PLay them.
As far as scenario goes, I think that's it. Me listing all the games I've played won't do any good, so that's it. Feel free to state your opinion!
If you're bored reading text, you can't call yourself an RPgamer.
I was never baptized and left the truth when I was in my mid teens. My mom is still a JW and in the past couple years I've come to feel that the org is a terrible thing. So I've bitched at my mom a couple times expressing how it effected my development growing up, how it limited my world experience, how it is a corrupt heartless entity, how it effected me negatively and continues to do so for thousands/tens of thousands if not more people every waking hour of our lives.
I shared these impressions with her only briefly during only a couple instances. We get along fine, and now I just kind of speak diplomatically, regarding the org as just another international non-governmental organization headed by currently seven typical human beings. Nothing special. She'll probably be with the org for the rest of her life, as will her husband because the congregation makes up almost all of their community network. No one is going to turn away from the community they have lived with and been a part of for more than ten/twenty years.
Well I won't say "no-one", but you get the picture. I feel as though we are both fated to live out the rest of our lives disagreeing on some very profound paradigms. But I try to overcome those differences by sharing insights into the way things really work in life. The way people live, and love, and hurt and the struggles we all face. And share examples of beautiful things that happen that are in no way connected to biblical principals. (Sorry, you did not specify if your just leaving the truth, or leaving biblical belief, or the whole deal). To show her that sollutions come from real problem solving, not pseudo-science and metaphysics.
 Basically I agree with the majority of what people are saying. You may be utterly disgusted and upset that you finally broke free of their mind control only to see that your whole family is still entrenched in it. You may have to come to terms with the fact that none of them may ever see it the same way. In this case, you just need to live a good life and make them part of that good life despite their backwards beliefs. Share with them your trials and triumphs. and when they say "Oh, that's like the story of the faithful guy who...", I suggest you say "yeah, it's kinda like that. But that example can be found from around the world and throughout all of human history after and predating bible events". But don't make it sound preachy. Damn I wrote a long post, hope it was somewhat helpful. Take care.
On my *second* playthrough of FFVI, I decided to rush through without saving. At the very beginning, when you get to control Locke, Mog, and a bunch of Moogles, I spent every turn stealing with Locke against every enemy until Locke and his moogle friends were brought down to low hp. I figured it did not matter, since I could always beat the boss with one of the other two groups.
But when I switched to the all moogle groups, I was distracted by a phone call. I was on active mode, so by the time I returned, that group had also been depleted of hp.
My last group, unfortunately, was the group with Mog. I hadn't fought with him yet, so he didn't have a dance yet. And I could not live with myself if I didn't steal his equipment, so he had to go into the boss battle unequipped. I went into the boss battle realizing that both of the other groups had no hp left. But even though I knew this was my only chance of getting past this part, the enemies somehow sensed my vulnerability and ganged up on the moogles in my party one at a time.
***: I effectively lost FFVI at the very beginning of the game in my *second* playthrough of the game.
BOOM!! That's right the 907 understands the lakers are the favorites. God it's weird thinking people don't know shit about our state. People in Alaska pick the best teams from the last year. Example. Saw a poll that said Alaskans like the packers, Yankees, lakers, and red wings best.
alaskans are fair weather fans
I agree on everything but number 3 that this guy has said.  Generally the low levels are riddled with smurfs whose sole reason of existence is to make the experience suck for people who actually are new in order to build their own fragile ego.  One way around this is to play bots until level 10 or so then jump into matchmaking, unless of course you find a good group of people in /r/summonerschool to group up with :) but i would avoid solo queueing non-bot games til you're around level 10 in the hopes of avoiding trolls and the like at least a little bit. 
TL:DR
Find a group of 4 others in /r/summonerschool to queue with or play bots til summoner level 10

While you say it's convenient, it just so happens that rappers are usually part of the criminal element and they spend the majority of their songs talking about being rich and killing people. Then they go hang around hungry killers and need a gun or they'll get robbed and/or killed.

There are 2 ways of looking at it.
First, it is pretty much a direct competitor with the product they currently sell, which will drive down demand for cigarettes.
Second, since they already have the machines to make tobacco cigarettes, if they can easily make cannabis cigarettes cheaper than anyone else, this will give them a new revenue source.
Granted, any machines producing cannabis cigarettes aren't being used to make tobacco ones any more, but that probably wouldn't be a problem due to a decrease in demand.
  If they are able to capitalize on having the rolling machines, they would support it.  Otherwise it is just a competitor.

Just because you have a 1.8 doesn't mean you have to shoot at 1.8 
I did some self portraits with my nifty 50 and they came out great I think I was set at 5.6 with a single soft box. I took like 30 pics and in the end thought they were all crap but I think it is different looking at your self. I gave the batch to some friends and they narrowed the lot down to 4 or 5 they all agreed on and I get a ton of compliments... 
don't self critique pictures of your self.
I was mad at my mother while snowboarding. I decided I wanted to make her feel sorry for me so I did a faceplant in the snow. I hurt myself way more than I thought I would. I couldn't move the lower half of my body and had to be taken off the mountain by the snow-patrol. They wanted to heli lift me down the mountain to the hospital but the weather was terrible so I rode in an abulance.

I had a coach for my PE class my sophomore year of high school. At the time, I was a skinny nerd who had just started to understand the fact that a bit of nerve will really get you through a lot and that your social status is kind of built on how you react to people, not really on any inherent quality (for the most part).  
Now, most of the people in my PE class were not the kind of kids that I'd have gotten to know. Several were actually gangsters or drug dealers, and it seemed like most of the rest *wanted* to be one. But, regardless, I was in class, and tried befriending them. Whenever we lifted weights, several of us would basically goof off, joke around, or try to show off. 
Once, this coach pulled me aside, and just spoke quietly to me. He kind of told me that the kids I was surrounding myself with weren't exactly good people, which I knew but didn't say anything to. He then said that if I wanted to be like them, then continue to do what I was doing. But if I wanted to be better, then I should step away and actually do my work. Just that, nothing else, no judgement towards me or them, more of an acknowledgement, and he treated all of us the same anyway.
Another time, while our class played another in baseball (despite not being much of an athlete, I've always been proud of the fact that I was a pretty accurate/powerful hitter, at least compared to most of the kids I've played against), I reacted negatively to having missed a ball, kind of hitting my bat against the home plate and getting pissed and probably yelled, "Come on!" 
He just kind of looked at me and laughed a bit at my reaction, as if thinking, "Why? It's so inconsequential," and just said "Come on, don't be like that."

Those two moments, despite having occurred in a grand total of about 45 seconds combined, probably shaped me more than I realized back then. I basically learned that
A) Who you surround yourself with reflects on you and influences you more than you know, and
B) Your life is often determined by your reaction to things, both large and small. Don't sweat the small stuff or be negative about something when it really won't help a bit.

** In two separate occasions, a coach from a highschool gymn class managed to give me quick, profound advice that I've found myself acting on years later.**
Not really, as claiming hate stems from admiration is somewhat broad.  Admiration definitely plays a huge factor in hatred, and could be argued in many situations,  but when someone has done something wrong to you? When someone who you thought you knew treats you in a way you never thought they would act towards you, it can be devastating and make you feel so many things whether they are true or not-
Fear that this person you love, is not actually the person you thought they were
Hatred towards yourself for being so naive
Confused , almost panic that there has to be some reason for their actions, that this person you love wouldn't act this way for no reason.
 In some situations definitely admiration, but certainly not all
I'm gonna answer backwards--last question first. I did go to Lijiang. It's fun in a giant, fake-ish old town way. Early early morning is the best time to be out and about--midday, any time of the year, it is usually shoulder to shoulder! The real old town was destroyed by an earthquake. But the rebuilt one is beautiful, and if you get out of the town into the hills (or tiger leaping gorge) it's worth it. Mama Naxi's hostel in Lijiang is fun and crazy (she had upwards of 15 cats, dogs, kittens, and puppies living in the common area). Mama Naxi is a great hostess--she really treats you well, and the in-house restaurant is great! 
I was never scared of legal trouble involving hash. The cops in Dali do know what it is, unlike the cops in most of China, haha, but they're more likely to come down on the dealers than the hapless tourists. 
Kunming and Dali are rarely humid because of the altitude, but for SE Asia, all I can say is take many showers! Cold ones, which, if you're on a budget, is all you'll get anyway. Talcum powder can help if you're prone to heat rash, and drink more water than you think you need. And don't wear tight clothes! Linen and cotton and loose! 
Lastly, I can't tell you much about budgeting for Japan since I've only ever been there for a layover, but Yunnan and Guangxi are pretty cheap places. If it's not a Chinese holiday, you can often get hostel beds for as little as 15 to 25 yuan per night (£3 to 5?) if you don't mind dorm beds. Though you may have to pay slightly more than that in Guangxi. Food is another 50-60 yuan (£5 to 7) a day if you stick to cheaper restaurants. A rule of thumb is that if the restaurant has a grubby tile decor, and lots of people waiting for their food, it's gonna be tasty and cheap. Check out what other folks are eating and point to order it if you don't know what it is. Hostel restaurants are overpriced and crappy, but if you can't read Chinese or crave burgers/chips/spaghetti they are certainly convenient.  I guess that's £10-15 a day for room and board if you are willing to be a budget champion. I would recommend finding out the exact prices of each bus/train you are planning to take and then increase the price by 10% to be safe. I was there 2009 and things change so quickly--definitely leave yourself some padding. I found that even the latest travel guide prices were out of date! 
Prices in Laos (I never made it to Vietnam or Cambodia) are similar or a little cheaper, but they have a hefty visa fee. So does China, for that matter, and I think you have to get it ahead of time unless you go to Hong Kong first. (Maybe that's just because I'm American.... :/ )
Thailand is a little more expensive all around because it's such well-trodden tourist territory. I think our hostel in Bangkok was around £10 per night, and there was no air conditioning! On any of the islands, be prepared for double or triple that, and still no AC! Overnight trains are a great way to save money since you avoid paying for a bed, but bring your own snacks (oh god, and most important: TOILET PAPER). There will always be boiled water available on trains in China. 
TLDR version: Actually, if you read nothing else I wrote, read this: BRING YOUR OWN TOILET PAPER EVERYWHERE. THEY DO NOT SUPPLY IT IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS ANYWHERE IN CHINA. Japan on the other hand....those toilets are fun! 2 kinds of bidet and a button just to make a flushing sound!
I don't have an insta-fix for you (sorry) but, try to gauge people. You'll scare most people off if you emotionally dump on them right away. Keep conversation light and friendly for a while, just build that friendship slowly. You don't seem to have a problem meeting people and making their acquaintance, but your problem seems to be that next step.
It's hard to tell sometimes what people want, but a good rule of thumb is to reciprocate what they do to you. Casual conversation all the time? Stick with it, if you don't give them a reason to think that you are not trustworthy, eventually they will trust you with a deeper part of themselves. Once they start doing this, take it as a green light to open up a bit more. Again, it's not a quick process (usually). 
Not everyone's the same. Some people will always only be acquaintances. Some people will be just like you, never the first to open up. Some people will break your trust, you may accidentally break someone's trust. 
Once you can get a good read on people (read: experience with multiple people), you can start gauging them to see if maybe you can take some of those steps first. But I would say that for now, since your detector is out of whack, let others determine the ebb and flow of the relationship. 
Just remember, no two situations will be the same.!
BTW, I found your hilarious
I agree with your analysis of the phrase "survival of the fittest." It does not even fully encapsulate evolution. Some species develop features which are not in their best interest to increase survivability. Species must also be able to reproduce. 
Case in point to illustrate this: Male peacocks are very well known for their colorful trains. Studies were done which indicated that the trains increase attractiveness towards peahens. Their tail were not shown to intimidate predators in any way, contrary to popular belief (ie. creepy eyes). While having a bright, shiny, cumbersome train is not a trait which increases survivability, it does increase attractiveness.
 An addition to survival of the fittest is that which increases reproductive potential
If the Vikes moved to LA and starting winning a lot with some championships, they would have a lot of support.
 Los Angeles has a lot of bandwagon fans.
It is absolutely core on Kog'maw, first off. It is also a great item on WW because it procs on his ult, 6 times I think. It is core on Teemo, because what else do you build on him? It greatly benefits Vayne. but is not "core." Shaco uses it very well, because his ult procs it as well, making it 8% per hit. There are others were it is good, but I think that covers all the characters that have it as a core build. It is really only good for most AD carries if the enemy is stacking health, were as Black Cleaver is for armor.
 There are few characters were the item is core, but it can be good on any one with attack speed. Buy madreds if enemy stacks health, buy BC if enemy stacks armor.
the blue preferred card has a 75$ annual fee and as such I would not get it. Additionally Airline miles are really only worth 1-1.5 cents per mile (unless this has changed significantly since I last did math on this) whereas instead you could get something like the amazon.com card and still get decent rewards (3 points for amazon dollar, 2 points for gas, restaurant, drug and office stores and 1 point on everything else) and these points can be redeemed at a rate of 1 point = 1 cent for cash, credit on your statement or if you are terribly lazy to pay for parts of amazon transactions.
you could just get a cash back rewards card and put all money earned from it into savings for whatever you need whether that is airlines or emergency car repair
Nope not really, I wasn't living there at the time, but she came to the place I was staying right after it happened with bruises still on her neck. I was the first person she came to and that meant something. I moved in with her shortly after and I was never scared of her ex. I mean if he has to beat women then he's not going to fuck with me. 7 years later we are still together married for 6 years and have kids and a very happy life. I knew from the first few times I was around her we were meant to be together. She also had to fight to keep her son from his shitheaded loser father (sperm doner), had to kick the drugs, as did I, find a job, her ex husband thought he was the kids father so he was battling for custody too, until he failed a DNA test. Almost kidnapped her kid twice. Before that when she was younger her stepdad used to beat her and mentally abuse her. She didn't get to meet her real dad until she was 16 'cause her mom was a flaming cunt (well still is) and sent her from Hawaii to the states with 25 cents and the clothes on her back. All because she liked to smoke a little pot every now and then.
 Needless to say my wife has some psychological issues and we used to have a really hard time communicating. I mean a normal dude probably would have left 10x over but I love her and she's worth it to me. Everything is super great now and I have people tell me all the time that they are jealous of our relationship and communication.  
My wife had a fucked up life and I still have stayed with her even tho its been hard 'cause I love her.  
&lt;- Weak Atheist here. I went on Birthright and had an awesome time. Eat a bunch of good food, meet some nice people. Have a good time. Depending on which organization you go with it will be secular or religious. I went with Hillel a reform(ish) college organization and it only had two short religious services. Definitely worth the cultural experience. 
Don't stress, you'll have fun.
John Brown. Leader of the Pottawatomie Massacre.
He stated that his actions were justified by, you guessed it, God.
Adolf Hitler. Chapter one in Mein Kampf.
He stated that exterminating the Jews was doing the work of the Lord.
Salem Witch Trials. Innocent women were burned at the stake. Why? To cleanse the Earth from evil under the belief that they were also doing God's work.
An atheist. Lets this person shot someone.
No excuse in supernatural. With no excuse in the supernatural, there is less reason for this person to do something as stupid as that.
You may say that an atheist believes in no consequence in the afterlife so he/she may do whatever the fuck he/she wants. This is a misconception as an atheist, from his/her lack of afterlife, values the current life and thus will avoid any damage to their life.
Turning it around, a theist who believes in afterlife will fear no consequences in afterlife as long as they believe they are doing the right thing, no matter of what their perception is right or not. 
Will an atheist blow himself up and a couple hundred people (or thousands) for 72 virgins in the afterlife? No. 
Why not? Because the atheist has one life to live, and it will not be cut short due to religious servitude.
TL;DR
Atheists hold more value in their present lives and no value in the afterlife, thus they are more prone to not doing ridiculous things. Religious people hold less value in their present lives and more value in their afterlife, thus they are more prone to doing ridiculous things.
You've captured the in-between phase of knowing your way of life isn't working but wondering what will work quite beautifully. I was there for a long time and I can tell you from experience that the sooner you dive in and do what you know you need to the better off you'll be. If you want integrity, meaning and purpose in your life there is no better way to start than to get your values and your actions on the same page. It sounds like you already know what your values are, the pursuit of a life that is more fulfilling than the one you have right now. The sooner your actions match those values the sooner things will start to get better.
You can escape if you want to. We'll be here to cheer you on.
I hate the fact that sometimes I have rage problems that hurt people close to me (not physically of course, but you know what I mean)
I also don't like the fact I am depressed &gt;:(
And that the rage half the time comes from fear and paranoia and the depression lying underneath it all...ugh /rant
I hate the depressive cycle even when medicated
Piracy has several definitions. The first and most obvious being piracy on the high seas. But what exactly does that mean in itself? It means the illegal diversion and re-appropriation of resources by taking them away from someone else, while they were in transit.
The second comes from a time not too long ago, when technologies allowed for mass dissemination of a broadcast medium. I am of course talking about pirate radio and pirate tv. In this case, the thing being stolen is the broadcast channels, which were portioned out by the government to public and private licensed broadcasters. The pirate station was the one that broadcast on a channel, without permission or license to do so, and thus usurp the use of that channel. In this case, it can be somewhat safely linked to the first definition of piracy, since by "stealing" a channel or frequency illegally, they are prohibiting the legal use of that channel or frequency, at least as long as they had a stronger signal. Big media was of course against it, since the pirate stations were effectively competition, whether or not the operators of the pirate station broadcast on a channel that was in use by someone else.
Now the third, and most recent "re-definition" of piracy. In this third case, nothing is being stolen except for potential sales. This in a way is a drastic change from any former definition of piracy. In the first definition, goods and resources were stolen. In the second is at least the stealing of a resources, the resource being the media resource broadcast channel. But in the third, nothing really tangible is being stolen.
That's not to say that piracy doesn't have an effect on sales, it's just that the effect is positive for some vendors and negative for other vendors. In fact, the vendors getting hurt the most are the ones that rely on marketing and advertising more, and the ones that depend more on word-of-mouth are getting the benefits (ie: more attention and more sales) of dissemination through file-sharing. And the people that depend on advertising the most? Well, that is Big Media, because since they are already in control of traditional broadcast media, advertising campaigns launched with broadcasts media as an advertising platform is relatively cheap for them.
piracy as file-sharing is a major departure from previous uses of the word, and wouldn't have been that way if not for Big Media.
For the sake of discussion, let me try to defend my action. (I'm trying to take things to the extreme to see at which point it ends up being ridiculous, although I have already agreed with your core point).
I agree with pt. 2 of your counter-defense. But on point 1, wouldn't it be fair to say that Makita has taken past knowledge of 2% Carbon and Iron to form Hardened steel and isn't crediting the original whoever.
Also, if I understand correctly from above, reverse-engineering even real products is illegal? What if there is no patent?
Coming back to the present day problems, how would it be possible to delineate patents and copyrights sanely so that we don't enter the ridiculous patent wars seen currently in the mobile sector? Wouldn't it be better for patents to expire in say 4-5 years tops to keep EVERYBODY constantly innovating and not just sitting on their laurels?
TLDR - Curious mind; lots of questions.
[Eldred v. Ashcroft.](
[Lawrence Lessig.](

I love when Reddit has these piracy/copyright circle-jerks every few months.  It gives me a chance to "sing" about one of our unsung heros, Mr. Lawrence Lessig.
The Supreme Court has already (wrongly) decided that you can have a an infinite number of extensions inside of a finite time.
So, like many of our other current issues (campaign finance, etc), the only way we can fix this problem is with another constitutional amendment.   There should have been a rule that when X number of amendments are being floated at one time: Automatic constitutional convention.
TL,DR; When Disney or Hollywood or Nashville pirated that was just good sense, or smart businessTM.  When you or I watch a TV show without the commercials? CRIMINAL!
&gt;And they should be able to protect their personal property rights from a website dedicated do to the exact opposite of that.
everybody has the same rights, but sometimes, our rights conflict. in a democracy, if everybody is doing it, then it is legal. there are minority rights, but they are not **more** important than everybody else's rights. so, how do a few of the wealthiest crooks that have been committing countless crimes in washington enforce their right to protect their property, and why do so many congressmen lobby on their behalf, against the will of the people?
** Most of the MPAA/RPAA should already be in jail**
&gt;copying something I own a thousand times is perfectly legal
Copying *is* a violation in itself. Copyright law clearly states that it is only the copyright holder has the right to copy (hence the term). Fair use is much more limited than what many people assume and it is at the discretion of a court to decide if you're covered, i.e. you need to provide a very good reason to justify making the copy. Creating 1 or 2 backup copies can be fair use but I can safely say that if they found 1000 copies of a CD in your place, *even if there is no evidence that you tried to sell or share them*, you're fucked.
(see [this]( for a good description of fair use)
And then there is the method that you used. Circumventing copy protection mechanisms like DRM is a crime in itself, even if the copy falls under fair use.
Common sense and copyright laws are not compatible.
No it is NOT piracy.  As many people have (humorously) shown with pictures: Pirates **steal** very real tangible goods and kidnap, murder and commit other heinous crimes.  
Duplicating a particular set of bits on a computer is *at worst* copyright infringement and nothing more.  The immoral part is that it is indeed freeloading.
So, my hypothetical question to you is:  If I download an album from an artist with a horrible recording contract and then send that artist $10 directly (circumventing the label).  In that scenario, I committed copyright infringement, no doubt.  But, did I do anything morally wrong?
As you can guess, I think not.
TL,DR; Pirates steal (and are generally violent moral/legal criminals).
Copyright infringement relates to piracy as much as clipping a fingernail is to a beheading.
In lieu of getting bogged down and typing out more walls of text, I'm just going to copy/paste what I had to say about copyright the last time this crap came up.  Hopefully I can get some folks to actually consider the reasoning behind copyright (and how modern implementations have completely abandoned) before raging against so-called "pirates"
-----------------------
For starters, there's no such thing as "intellectual property."  The issue here is copyright, and they're not property, they're a limited monopoly granted by the government for the purpose of encouraging the creation of creative works.  Treating it as "property" only furthers the misconception that copyright is some kind of inalienable right of mankind, when in fact it's a compromise society *chooses* to make, expecting that granting that monopoly will benefit society more because of increased production of creative works than it will harm society through reduced public access to those works.
When copyright laws were passed, restrictions on any form of copying obviously only applied to commercial copying, because obviously only a commercial copier would own a printing press.  In theory, it forbade individuals from copying portions of a work by hand, but in practice that would be a completely private act that could never feasibly be punished in a court of law.  Prohibiting commercial copying like these laws did is obviously a big net positive for society: it insures that you will be the only one selling your work after releasing it, giving you a powerful incentive to be creative, and it doesn't really restrict members of the public from doing anything they would find particularly useful.  
Copyright also had an original term of something like 15 years.  Given that the motivation for copyright law was to allow you to get a decent return on your investment before your work went into the public domain, that term should have become drastically *shorter* in modern times, rather than longer.  Nowadays a creative work can make you a millionaire in less time than it would have taken you to even get your book typeset for a printing press back when copyright was established, and yet the term has been *expanded* to author's life plus 80 years?  That's absolutely absurd.  With term extensions like this, we're guaranteeing that none of what we consider our creative culture today will be usable in the public domain during our lifetimes...heck, even our parents' generation of art won't be in the public domain until we're too old to care about it any more.  This is clearly a *serious* net negative for society (do you honestly think the fact that they can't collect royalties up until their death would stop anyone from producing creative works?), and moreover, these terms have been applied *retroactively* to works that would have passed into the public domain by now.  Retroactive extension is blatantly meant for no one's benefit other than those holding copyrights, because it's obviously impossible for anyone to retroactively produce more creative works from the period of time these extensions are being made for.
Copyright terms aside, what's going on with Internet file sharing is purely private copying, the kind of activity that was always effectively permissible under copyright law because it was a completely private act that no one would ever have legal standing to find out about and sue you for.  The practice has gone on ever since we had re-recordable media, and even before that in the form of somewhat cumbersome vinyl casts.  Inflammatory rhetoric aside, the music industry has survived just fine through all those varieties of copying, and it will survive just fine through this one.  The big issue now, however, is that the act that was previously secret has now become publicly visible, which is leading to the massive lawsuits we've all become accustomed to seeing on our front page.
Now, I could give you the usual run-through of reasons that so-called "piracy" won't kill the music industry (people obviously wouldn't be out buying entire artists' discographies on a whim, "pirates" become paying customers when they decide they like an album, etc.), but I'm going to put all that aside for a moment and claim that whether or not the music industry as we know it survives is irrelevant.  What matters to me is whether the bargain we've established with our copyright laws are a net positive for society, and at this point I think it's clear that they are not.  The benefit to society of having our entire creative culture at our fingertips to share amongst ourselves as we please would be far greater than whatever marginal increase in artistic production we're gaining by allowing the RIAA to bankrupt single mothers over a handful of songs transferred over the Internet.
If you want to have an honest discussion on copyright, you need to toss out these loaded concepts like "intellectual property" and "stealing music," and take a good, hard look at the positives and negatives the legislation holds for our society.  Even if you want to argue that file sharing should not be permitted, you have to admit that the current duration of copyright, if nothing else, is *clearly* the product of blatant rent-seeking behavior from the artistic industries, and our politicians need to be held accountable for locking up our culture for an absurd length of time in exchange for bribes.  Regardless of exactly where you stand on the issue, it should be obvious enough that today's situation with regards to the production and distribution of creative works is **nothing at all like that of the time period when copyright was initially established**, and we deserve, if nothing else, a serious, honest public debate about whether or not these restrictions are beneficial to a modern society in the information age.
- Copyright infringement is not stealing, intellectual property is not property, and you're being massively intellectually dishonest with yourself and others by using loaded words to frame the debate in your preferred terms and make your opponents out to be thieves instead of at least *pretending* to make rational arguments.
Yeah, get the HX750. The HX650 will work but it will get very warm. I know because my HX650 runs dual 560 (non-Ti). While it does dual 560 without trouble I would not feel comfortable with dual 570s.
 the HX750 is an excellent choice for what you're doing :-)
I didn't read many of the comments but the ones I did read did not mention this.
I think the idea of them being heroes has to do with their bravery, because like it or not they're put in a situation where they have to face each day knowing with a certainty that it is one of their last, and then try to be happy while knowing that.
**SO BRAVE**
From a healthy person:
It really hinges on your definition of hero. We often see heros as people who are put in difficult circumstances, not necesarily by their choice but by life. So someone who has been delivered a crushing blow by life (sickness, disaster, victimization), and rises above it, not playing the victim, even though they may be, is considered a hero. This particularly true for kids, who may not be able to understand why they are hurting, but still try to be brave in the face of that pain. That makes them into heros.
 heroism doesn't require you to choose the circumstance, just the response to it.
IMO,  people who commit suicide are not only cowards but selfish, assholes too. I refuse to see them as victims. A person with depression CAN be a victim of a chemical imbalance but suicide is a decision that makes a clear statement that enduring your pain is harder for you than enduring the loss of you is by your family, friends, coworkers, etc. It is a selfish assumption that cannot be excused with depression.
*** saying that your pain is too great to continue living is saying that you'd rather your loved ones deal with pain and heartache than you.
This answer is complex but has been studied in depth. I'll do my best to explain and cite relevant articles of medical anthropology but I have a meeting soon.

Different cultures have different views of illness. Different cultures also have different value systems that inform their perception of illness. One major contributor is the human obsession with causation. We like to imagine that A causes B, when it's far more likely that A put your at a higher risk of contracting B. Just after WWII, Heider &amp; Simmel explored the tendency for humans to rely on intentional causality to explain why something happens. While a decent amount of research is still going on today, the consensus is that the process is innately human. We make repeated observations and allow those observations to inform our conception of causality.

But it's extremely important, and vital to answering your question, that we understand the cross-cultural meaning of "cause." In many languages, there isn't a word for "cause" and the contemporary meaning of cause in English is a relatively recent development coming from the Latin legal term 'causa', or the charge against  a person in a legal case. We now use "cause" to denote a causative microbe or pathogen that produces disease, characterizing it as an enemy to be defeated.

 In other countries, you don't have this same illness etiology. For example, in English we can ask "what is the cause of Malaria?" But if we were to travel to Mali and ask the same message in Bambara, we would literally ask, "What leaves the disease of cold sweats (chills) with people?" The language, and indeed culture, do not have a term for cause, nor do they have the same, deep conceptualization the way we do. To build off our Mali example, if you were to ask, "how has the disease worsened?", it would be literally translated as, "has the disease become nasty?"

Medical anthropologists from the 1950's studied this phenomenon. Young and Foster were probably two of the most influential in describing  these cultural differences. Young described two belief systems: Externalizing and Internalizing. 

The externalizing system viewed causation as having an active agent in which the individual is victimized. Illness itself was considered a special case of misfortune, often affected by magic or something beyond one's control. With that said, there were also multiple levels of causality that required positive action on behalf of the individual to overcome. These systems required positive action to prevent a disease (a sacrifice, for example) but, ultimately, the responsibility lies beyond one's control.

Internalizing systems, often found in South Asia, are quite the opposite. Causation is considered the result of an equilibrium loss that's unrelated to other misfortune. In traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine, people would cure their fever by eating foods considered either 'hot' or 'cold.' Further, prevention focused on avoidance of equilibrium loss and the responsibility for getting better resided with the patient. The patient, for example, would take positive action to eat a certain food. 


The terms externalizing and internalizing are now dated but the ideas remain relevant. Different systems often are an amalgamation of the two. In America, we have a combination of belief systems. Many often imagine that illness is a special case of misfortune that's rooted in poor luck. However, we tend to ascribe meaning and causality to something that's just a statistical happening. 

**** It comes down to belief system and illness etiology. The very interesting field of medical anthropology is dedicated to these kinds of questions.

Finally  
Does that mean people who don't accept the treatment are brave? 
Ironically...i always figured if I got something like cancer I wouldn't do treatments. I think it is an ugly industry and don't want to spend what time I do have left being poked and prodded. Which means in my mindset maybe treatment is more brave.
Also...I'm sure it is easier to say you won't do treatment when you are not sick...
I also think I may be rambling.
 going to do serious comment. ended up talking to myself.
You realize it's a battle of semantics, right? Hero most certainly never meant doctors that save lives in the course of their working day nor did ever mean a victim of a disease that has managed to put on a brave face. The definition of hero clearly expanded from its origins in Gilgamesh or Beowulf or Odysseus. The intent behind trying to apply the term to a sick child is understandable, but that doesn't mean it's not completely diluting and contradicting the entirety of the word's etymology. We could spend all day talking about other words that have lost their meaning due to advertising, public relations, business-speak ramblings, political-correctness, etc. The problem is when we have a language filled with words that are so utterly inclusive it allows words like "hero" and "victim" to overlap in the slightest bit (that is, embodied by the same person, at at instant, concerning the exact same predicament).
 You don't become a hero just for fighting something. No, reddit is not "incredibly stupid *and* ignorant" (emphasis mine) for distinguishing two very different words.
&gt;yet, my black dachshund had two dapple parents and none of the puppies were dappled.
It's entirely possible for two dapple/merle dogs to have puppies that are not merle. The gene is incompletely dominant and works like so:
    Double (homozygous) merle:    MM
    Regular (heterozygous) merle: Mm
    Not merle:                    mm
Your dog's parents were **Mm**. This means they were capable of producing any of those possible combinations, with the following frequencies/probabilities:
    MM: 25%
    Mm: 50%
    mm: 25%
Thus, it's entirely possible for two merle dogs to have an entire litter of non-merle **mm** puppies...it's just not very common—usually, probability favors producing at least one regular merle, and often a double merle.
[If that doesn't make sense, here's a site which might explain it better, and with punnet squares.](
Brindle works in a similar but slightly different way (autosomal dominant), and it's perfectly normal for two brindle dogs to have puppies without brindle.
Anyways, what this means is: in order for a dog to **be** dapple or brindle, it **must** have a parent who was dapple or brindle, because it requires one copy of a dominant gene. These are simply not recessive traits that skip generations and pop up unexpectedly.
&gt;My mother's dapple had two brindle parents and he turned out to be a gorgeous dapple (with blue eyes!) and my mother's chocolate dachshund had a dapple brother with both parents being chocolate and tan with limited markings.
Dapple/merle can manifest cryptically, meaning that it's not always clearly visible/apparent despite being genetically **Mm**, and is likely the explanation for the phenomena you explain here (especially since you mention the other limited markings). Either that, or the female got mated by second male accidentally/unknowingly. This is also highly likely—accidents do happen and mixed litters occur often!
The chocolate is inherited in a different way (autosomal recessive) so I won't confound the discussion with it.
 what you describe (merle randomly popping up, similar to a recessive) is genetically impossible, and probably a result of cryptic merle expression.

Hah! I'd almost argue liking her is sexist (though I am enjoying her candy this week). I mean her lyrics leave a dirty taste in my mouth.. They are as damsel-in-distress as 60's pop. I thought some of them were meant to be ironic, due to their over the topness, but no. She glamorises the pathetic, vapid, helpless little girl that needs no more attention. It's almost as bad as [The Crystals' He Hit Me]( except maybe even worse because Lana's message (communicated mostly through her plastic packaging) is implicit.
**** In practice, I am listening to her song *Radio* on repeat. As a feminist, I find her offensive.
meh...its pretty true. I truly believe their are savants in the world - but I believe that the vast majority of people who are truly successful in life are successful in almost everything they try to do. It is very much a mindset.
 exceptional people are exceptional.
i'm your size, and i also have motivation issues.
i hate doing activities that feel unproductive (walking to nowhere, lifting weights that don't move something from one place to another). i've had the most success with taking classes - power yoga and martial arts. first, there's the schedule and the lost money/disappointed teacher and classmates if you don't go. second, i'm learning how to do something and the exercise is a side-effect. i found that kung fu was a gateway drug into other exercise, because i wouldn't go to the gym to lose weight, but i would totally go to the gym to do exercises that would help me deepen my stance or move faster. and really, anything that gets your muscles toned and gets you thinking about the way you hold your body is going to push you towards what you want. even something like belly dance, which isn't full of tiny stick people and is actually great for abs and arms and endurance.
try martial arts, belly dance, or look into Baptiste yoga
Before I even got to your post, I had a little conversation with myself:
&gt; I wonder if this is the OP's friend in the picture.
&gt;Meh, it's probably just an example.
I came to that conclusion because if it were the OP's friend, I thought he/she would say "This is my friend" as opposed to "Condition My Friend Has."
 OP never lied or was misleading. Was merely ambiguous. You were drawing conclusions.

Two years ago i had a gf who was weird in many ways. One of them was that when she got really drunk, she who would become *literally* someone else. I say "literally" because the change was perceptible, she didn't speak the same way, she looked at people differently, overall she just *was* different. 
I remember she gave me the chills cause her gaze was fucking dark and empty and her voice went gravelly. She would end up crying and never remembered those episodes the next day. It was really creepy.

Fast forward when we broke up 8 or 9 month later (both of us moved out), she gave me a bunch of presents, amongst them the last weeks of her intimate diary, pages torn apart and sewed together.
As i read it i came across weird things, including dialogues with someone i didn't knew : Melesis. She spoke to that girl on most entries in the journal. When it came to her, things would usually immediatly become dark and depressive. It would go on for a paragraph and then switch back to normal and positive thoughts. In fact now that i read it again, this journal looked more like letters to this girl than an intimate diary. Most entries ended as "See you later Mel".
So as i was intrigued about Mel, i went to my gf and asked her how I couldn't knew this girl. 
Her : "She is the one living in my head"
Me : "Oh."
Today I still consider this journal as one of the greatest gift someone ever gave me. Some parts are just pure poetry, and I'm not into poetry the slightest.
*** : I broke up with my gf and learned that she had two distinct personalities.
Oh my god, my ex used to love popping pimples, too. I don't get them often but once in a while I'd get one creep up on my back near the shoulder blades. Of course I couldn't see nor feel it. You'd be brushing your teeth when all of a sudden two nails would suddenly prod you unexpectedly. It was a pretty big turn-off.  
**TL:DR, ladies, if you have a fascination with popping pimples, please keep it on the dl**
You are misinformed.  Let's focus on the Cherokee for the sake of an example. The Cherokee were anything but "a large terrorist organization". They had an established society, modern (for the times) towns, were well integrated into the economy of their area, and lived in relative peace with the whites around them. Jackson's administration wanted to void established treaties and move them west of the Mississippi. The Cherokee took up the issue like the civilized people they were, in the court system. They took their cause to the Supreme Court of the United States, and won. Jackson blatantly ignored the SCOTUS decision and forced marched the Cherokee west, killing a great many in the process. Who was the terrorist here, the people who abided by treaties and laws and sought to resolve disputes through legal channels, or those who disregarded civilized behavior and engaged in a xenophobic campaign to illegally eject a peaceful people from their homeland through force of arms?
Fuck Andrew Jackson
It kind of amazes me how many people just think debt equals bad.
Think of it this way:
Lets say theres no lawn mowing company in your town. Lets also say youre certain that one would be very successful, but dont have access to a lawn mower. You go to a bank, tell them the idea, and they say ok well give you 1k dollars for a mower if you give us 1030 in a year. Youd therefore go into debt at a 3% interest rate. If you think your new business can make 1100 in a year, you are hypothesizing that your return from the investment will be 10%. Therefore why would you not go into debt? Your returns created with money you would not otherwise have more than cover the cost of debt.
The same applies to countries. If china is willing to give us loans at 1% and we think we can use that money to grow GDP 4% why wouldnt we?
Makes perfect sense to have some debt as long as you are certain that your returns cover interest. 
debt can be useful to grow your economy
Edit: on my phone sorry if there are typos 
Let's say you *think* your black neighbor looks at you funny.  Instead of buying a $1,000 lawn mower you buy a $100 used lawn mower and spend $900 on security to protect your business.  As you're mowing one day you see different black person running away from your business van with your wallet.  You felt shocked despite the fact you ignored the security reports saying there was an escaped convict who likes petty theft.  Your reaction is to go back to the bank and take out a $10,000 to hire the Ku Klux Klan and some Illinois Nazis to go to a neighboring town and kick the shit out of every black person they see.  Now you're $11,000 in debt and all you have to show for it is a pissed off town and a cheap ass mower that barely works.
debt can fuck over your economy
Yup. You keep taking on debt to grow  your business. In years where you think your business won't do well, you try to minimize the debt you take on. If it's an el nino year and you think that grass will grow very well, you will probably max out your savings and get more funding from the bank to expand. By using all available funds, even if some of those funds are borrowed, you may be able to beat out the competition and grow your company. 
You must also remember that in all markets, if you don't go to the bank for a loan, someone else might beat you to the punch. If you don't buy new lawn mowers, your competition might and steal some of your marketnshare. If the US doesn't use borrowed funds in an efficient manner, or doesn't borrow funds at all, other countries will and their economies will grow at a (relatively) faster rate.
This is simple economics, and it REALLY amazes me how few people on this site understand. I consider myself a social liberal, could not care less if someone else decides fuck someone of the same sex, but I find that most people here have a really hard time understanding how banks and the economy work.
If you are certain that your returns will continue to be higher than the interest you pay on debt, keep adding to the deficit because that in turn will grow the economy. You get into trouble when you get cocky when predicting those returns and you fall short (i.e. Greece)
I'm actually really suprised at the responses on here. Love does not equal sex, nor is sex a prerequisite for a "healthy" relationship. If he doesn't want to have sex, and you do, and he refuses to, then THAT'S a problem. But it's no more a problem than you wanting him to do the dishes, and him refusing. If it's important to you, enough so that you're willing to drop the relationship, then you should drop it. If you are perfectly happy with the rest of your relationship and everything is healthy (you talk, you argue, you are affectionate in ways other than sex), and you don't think seldom sex is a dealbreaker, then you should just keep on keeping on. It sounds to me like you guys have a great relationship... why would you break up for something as petty as sex? 
TL:DR: You can have sex anytime with anyone (if you're single). Meeting someone who you are compatible with and with whom you can have a great relationship for years, that is tough to find. 
You should explain why.  Hate is not the way to have a discussion.  Making comments like this does not help with any cause and is only devisive in nature.  There are plenty of smart christians out there:
  
  I am an agnostic athiest, but I dont believe belief in god limits what people can contribute to science and society.
  **tl/dr: If you dont have something intelligent to say, don't.**
I'm ... not really sure what you're trying to achieve in asking that question, but I'll take a stab at it. 
You don't have to hate pedophiles to agree that children need to be protected. Hating pedophiles has led to a mass hysteria that's resulted in the over protection of children (protecting them from the big bad wolf, and major over alert on stranger danger). There's no justification for harming a child. Nor is there justification for destroying the lives of someone who's peed, drunk, next to a play ground at 3am. Or prosecuting a 17 year old for sending nude pictures of themselves to someone (or receiving them from their underage girl/boyfriend). 
The horrific reality of sexual abuse is that it's pretty rarely strangers who do it. Your kid is *far* more likely to be molested by a close relative or family friend than they are to be abducted off the street. 
Instead, "protect the children!" has become the battle cry that has allowed ill-thought out legislation, not only causing people convicted and branded as pedophiles to have no place to legally live (forcing them to live in colonies under bridges, for instance), but also allowing a lot of other nasty stuff to happen. We need to get the fuck out of our knee-jerk reactionary mindset and start thinking through this stuff practically.
 hating pedophiles has led to a lot of unnecessary and awful consequences. Instead of hating them, let's stop them from hurting kids, and prevent other potential predators from doing so moving forward. Pedophiles are this era's bogey man. 
For me it goes in cycles. My beer cycle ended around last september, been boozing with vodka, gin, rum and whiskey since then. Eventually I'll end up starting a new beer cycle I think.
It also depends on the season and how I'm exercising: Where I live the winters are really cold and my lungs won't allow much running outside, so I tend to be living in the gym for most of the time, eating tons and focusing on building muscle with minimal cardio. I've found that hard liquor feels a lot better while doing this.
When the snow melts and I'll start running again and training endurance, the ol' buddy beer will most likely come over again. It's a pretty stupid point since boozing while on a strict training schedule isn't ideal at all, but when I drink, I feel the carb-heavy hangovers with beer are a lot less painful while I'm in running mode, compared to hard liquor.
 Liquor in the winter, beer in the summer. Both have their good sides and tastes, but they get you hammered either way.
I used to love liquor. Vodka all the way. Then it became a mix if gin, whiskey, and pepsi. Unfortunately (or fortunately, really), I realized that brown liquor made me angry and kinda violent, so I have up on it and turned to beer. the only good thing about valentines day this year is that I will be six months off liquor, so it's beer only for me. I miss vodka a lot though.
*** 6 months off liquor and only drinking beer, but I miss vodka a lot. So no, you are not the only one who prefers hard liquor over beer.
The line for stout/porter is more blurred then heavier &amp; more alchololic porter=stout.  
This is honestly the easiest semi-generalized way to tell the difference:
Roasted barley adds roasted aromas/flavors to beer as well as a dry bitterness.  Stouts almost always contain some amount (often 7-15% roasted barley).  Often porters use black patent/patent malt, which is perceived as dry/acrid/ashy and only occasionally contain roasted barley.  Black patent is less common in stouts.  Generally stouts have more roasted flavor, &amp; often more dry bitterness. Porters are often sweeter on the nose and palate. Stouts are often darker, ranging from dark brown to black, while porters are almost all some shade of brown.
**TL/DR**: Stouts contain roasted barley; Porters do not (usually)

Because you never know where the originating source of the call is coming from you abide by federal laws and always announce 'This call may be monitored for quality purposes'.  If you were to only abide by State laws the first time you have someone out-of-state connecting (even by accident) you would risk being at fault.
Basically, it is now considered default that any call center larger than a few employees will be recording at least some if not all of the calls.  The wording also covers live monitoring of the call.  As an employee you do not have the reasonable expectation of privacy on the call however I expect all call center includes in it's employee handbook discussion on call monitoring.
- No expectation of privacy, assume any call can be recorded or monitored.  
In Grade 8 our year a bunch of kids got to go away on a trip. I think it was to Montreal or Quebec. I can't really remember. You basically had to pay like $450, and you'd get to go away for a week with all your classmates. My parents asked me if I wanted to go, and I asked "If I don't go, can I have a bit of the money you'd spend and just stay home all week?" 
They tossed me about $100 and I ended up renting a ton of movies with my best friend who also stayed, and we had a wicked week. 
When the class got back however there was a scandal a brewin'. 
A ton of the 'popular' guys in our grade had all gotten a room together and invited all the guys into their room. Once in there, they all decided to tune to the French Showcase channel, which back then at least would have usually softcore porn on once it hit about 11. Anyways, these guys all started to talk about masturbating, and apparently they started to all jerk off. It started with one, then another, then another. Until eventually the guys jerking off started to tell the guys *not* jerking off that they were losers and gay for not being able to look at a naked woman and get hard. They made one of the more sensitive kids in our year cry and lock himself in the bathroom because when they pantsed him, and told him to jerk off he couldn't and they all started to mock him. 
About 4 guys in my year (one of them my buddy who relayed all of this to me) left the room finding it all fucked up. And eventually one of the four ended up mentioning that (name changed to protect the innocent) Omar was crying in the bathroom in room 400 or whatever. So the teacher unlocks the door walks in and sees a ton of kids with their pants around their ankles looking at porn. 
Shit hit the fan. All the guys got yelled at, they tried to keep it hushed up so that the girls didn't hear about it, but eventually it got out though it didn't cause nearly as much fuss as it should have since all the girls had crushes on the guys that were doing it and acting like assholes. Parents weren't called for some reason. 
Years later my buddy(the guy who stayed) and I still laugh our asses off about that. Ended up playing some wicked PSOne games, and watching movies while getting out of a week of school while missing out on a big awkward Grade 8 circle jerk. 
*** Kid's are fucked up. Grade 8's pressured other kids into jerking off to softcore french porn. Told them they were gay the couldn't get hard. Got caught by teacher. Massive conspiracy cover up so teachers could continue to go on week long trip to Montreal for future year groups. 
I also took my MSF course in November back in '07 and it was surprisingly chilly. Snowed as well. Just dress in layers and you'll be fine. I had no riding gear at that point so I wore some thermal under tops and bottoms and a winter down jacket with some gloves and all went well.
After getting my license I rode through that and the following winter in a leather Joe Rocket Jacket and leather JR gloves. The thrill of finally being able to ride was still fresh so the cold didn't get to me. Four years later and if its under 50 degrees take the car.
 Layres, under armour winter gear, and a decent pair of gloves.
Yea I'll admit that YER is balanced, I was thinking more of the spycicle. I play a lot of pyro and it just pisses me off when I know someone is a spy and I have to flame them for so long before they catch fire so I can axtinguish/flare them. More than once they've been running down a medic/engi, so I had to airblast them to protect the medic/engi from the stab, at which the point the spy cloaked and disappeared.
 I'm a pyro that's butt-hurt over the spycicle, what else is new.
A spycicle-wielder grabbed intel and was running away from pyro me yesterday as a spy (on doublecross).  Two seconds of fireproofness -- or, as I prefer to call it, being *completely invulnerable* to me -- was a long way to carry that stuff; he wound up getting to teammates and bringing it home.
I know a lot of people think the solution to that is to carry the shotgun vice the flaregun.  But there are two reasons not to do that as a pyro: 1) the shotgun suffers horribly from damage fall-off over distance, so if you're not close enough to engage with the flamethrower, you basically aren't close enough to bother fighting with the guy, and 2) *you're a fucking pyro* so setting people on fire should be key to ALL your weapons.  Meaning a spycicle which just makes people invulnerable to your whole friggin class is lame, lame, lame.
 Me, too.
Ok time for the long version.
July 4, 2010. I'm at my fiance's house. A few months before I had gone to see my best friend at his college (I've known him for 17 years). After I came back from my weekend visit, my fiance no longer wants to do ANYTHING with me. 
His friends suggest going to St. Louis for the fireworks down there. His mother said no and he started getting all pissy and throwing a hiss. We then talk for a bit. He proceeds to tell me that he is CONVINCED that I cheated on him with my best friend (another fun tid-bit, I'm related to my best friend). We break up and I don't hear from him for the rest of the month.
School starts in August and he wants to get back together and try to work on our problems. I then ask him if he has a crush on anyone else at that time. He responds with a name of a friend of ours. I tell him that I'm not getting back together with him until he can commit to me and only me.
We agree to try to be friends. We talk for a bit, a few weeks later he brings up the subject, I say no, he cusses me out. Wash, rinse, repeat.
During this time I try to move on. I met a boy that had a psycho ex that claimed to be pregnant with his kid. His family is devoutly catholic, so he's forced to break up with me, with no proof of this so called child.
My ex fiance's grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer and he tells me he's afraid of losing me as well. I tell him that all he has to do is prove to me that I can trust him. He then asks my 17 year old friend out two weeks later.
Neither one likes condoms and she's not on birth control.
Boys, keep this in mind. I made my fiance a sandwich everyday of my own free will.
  My stupid fiance left me, an awesome, sandwich making nerd, for a seventeen year old only child that gets everything her way.
I'm sorry to hear about what happened to your friend. In spite of that, ecstasy is not the same marijuana. It's almost physically impossible to overdose on marijuana. 
In any case, you may have an experience with your friend taking ecstasy and being around drugs, but that doesn't mean you have an educated opinion about it. Experience =/= knowledge. You clearly have a negative bias about drugs and you're generalizing them as a whole. Using your past experience with drugs to stereotype them into a single category isn't good and I would suggest that you refrain from doing that. Even if you hate drugs, learn about them instead of mindlessly bashing on all of them for no reason. 
Experience with one drug doesn't mean you're informed about all drugs.
hmm      i know nothing about the topic?  
You have NO IDEA of the experiences i had with drug addicts. whitnessing my friend die on an extasy overdose at the age of fucking 13. I blamed myself. Why didnt i stop him the first time i saw him dooin drugs and tryin them out. Why did i just stood there while he slowly killed himself. I fell in a depression, isolated myself, cut contact with all my other friends.  I would not get hurt like that again. I thaught it was easy to be a lone wolf. But as i saw my former friends move on with their lives just like he never existed. 
Ultimatly i just got angry at everyone, started fights in school. Did things of incredible danger and stupidity just so i may get killed. Life had no meaning to me anymore. It took me 4 years to reconnect to other people and establish relationships with other people. The only way i found to become "normal" again was to take all the pain and the hate and force it on one topic: DRUGS.  Im completly normal. you would never tell that im a violent person, but as soon as the topic drugs comes up that part of my brain gets activated.  But even that has changed. i now dont beat up drugdealers and addicts anymore, but just make completly ignorant comments about drugaddicts in real life or the internet

 Im fuckin CRAZY
This is unfortunately not quite true, most notably in the context of the specific scenario that you have set up (i.e. a wood table).  
First - transmission of Influenza via fomites (inanimate object or substance) is quite low, with certain wood surfaces (like your table) being the worst at causing transmission.
Second - even on non-wood surfaces, fomite transmission of influenza only has a good possibility of occurring if the surface in question is touched within 24 hours of direct expose to Influenza virus in a manner that allows the "toucher" to pick up a large enough inocculum of virus to infect themselves.
 
In short, for you to get flu from a table, or from a dog's fur, an infected person would need to sneeze onto the table/dog, you would then have to rub the table/dog within 24 hours and then get enough of the innoculum from the dog/table onto your hand, and then from your hand onto your face.  
This is not very likely, but it CAN happen.  This is why keeping surfaces clean during flu season is important.  While it's not a major mechanism of new infection, it is a mechanism that we can control.  Just like covering our mouths when we sneeze helps control the mechanism of transmission through the air.
Transmission of influenza is largely aerosol transmission.  
For those interested, here are links to 2 open-access articles about Influenza transmission:
Aerosol transmission: 
Fomite transmission:  
for the articles -  
Article 1: Influenza transmission through the air is highest at cold temps and low relative humidity and is actually blocked at high relative humidity (80% RH). 
Article 2: Influenza transmission via fomites is possible but unlikely to occur.
edit: articles weren't linking properly
I don't think it causes any trouble. If you don't like it, you can ignore it.
But I 100% agree that the average user here isn't looking for a  This, like many of the other small, intellectual subreddits (like r/law, for example) are here for the whole story, not the Cliffs Notes.
I find it super annoying and downvote it with impunity.
Good economics writing, like good economics, is about detail and careful thought. If you just read s you are missing the what is important. 
The implication is that headline-only readers might at least read the TLDR, which would be an improvement.
The way I read it, the main "con" argument is that it encourages people to read summaries rather than the whole article itself, perhaps particularly when confronted with opposing ideology.  This may lead to more shallow and limited comments and discussion, less engagedment, which can actually be pretty good in this subreddit.
The main "pro" argument that holds water with me is that it summaries can be useful, and comments can be downvoted when they're not.  The comments don't add much clutter and don't hurt anything so long as the above "con" argument isn't true (or so long as those reading the tldr wouldn't have contributed to the discussion anyhow). 
Anyhow, as a result of all the comment reports and the comments here, I booted the bot, so you don't have to worry about blacklisting r/economics, since you're post-surgery.  We can unboot when you feel better and can blacklist it pain-free. 
Regardless of the outcome, I'm impressed you were able to write such a bot - it is typically right on target - and I really hope you get better soon. 
It's because there's only twelve players on each team.  If they added jets, even just one to each team, then the match would often have over half the players in vehicles at a time.
Let's look at the US side as an example ('cause I can't remember the Russian side's vehicles).  One Amtrack and one LAV usually takes at least four players, two to drive and two to gun.  Two Little Birds is another two players.  That's six already.  Add a jet, and suddenly you've got less than half the team on infantry.  And that's assuming no passengers for any of the non-jet vehicles.
This is a general problem for the console versions.  Low player limits combined with numerous vehicles makes the game seem barren.  Ideally, you'd have the majority of the players on foot (when they're not being transported, at least) with the vehicles fulfilling unique, important roles.  If the vehicles are more numerous than the players, it makes them less special and it makes the game feel empty.
  Jets would further imbalance the vehicle-to-infantry ratio in Canals on consoles.
At first, I was pretty excited to see that you could get one through their developer program for $99 ([explained here]( because once I decide which system I'm going with, I'm certainly going to be developing my own plugins and I wouldn't mind making it available to other people for free since the company did me a solid by dropping the price.
That was until I saw their bullshit terms which basically amounts to "we demand high quality plugins delivered in a short timeframe in exchange for a trivial discount on our product". 
Seriously, $150 is between 1 and 3 hours of professional developer time (depending on skill set), which is no where near enough time to learn their api AND develop a cool app. 
Vera does seem to do a lot of extra things, which, if you're looking for that could justify the price, but all I want is hardware that I can control from unix (via compiled code, some known network protocol, etc) that will (wirelessly, securely?) allow me to control electrical outlets. 
I was offended by micasaverde's developer terms. 
Having been in your shoes at 17 (how old are you?) but with better luck with plan b, what you need to do is wait. Remember that modern medicine is a miracle, and though she will need your help and support your girlfriend will be fine. You will also need to blow off some steam, remember to take care of yourself, go for long punishing runs, whatever you do, so that you can be good to go. It's hard to hide and hard to keep inside but I found that reddit actually helped me. It feels good to tell somebody. And remember, if anybody does find out, you and your gf are a team, it doesn't matter who told who, that can come later, just tough it out. I had to deal with my gf's hyper conservative mother during the time, who was enraged and driven to near madness. 
it'll be ok in tge end, keep that in mind and in your heart. 
Okay, now it's time to begin development on VLMC. I have been waiting for this project to show significant progress for the longest time now. From what is out so far, it looks great, but is missing the stability I am used to in VLC. 
 VLMC is something that is potentially awesome
Oh please, this is a ridiculous statement. This whole "woe is me, poor little atheist" shit has to stop. It is things like this that only further divide us (atheists) from people who adhere to a monotheistic religion. Two groups that are so strongly divided are much less likely to communicate and seek to understand each other. History of man has proven that two groups like this rarely reach a resolution that ends well for both sides. As atheists we are not burdened by centuries of rules, obligations, ideals and highly inaccurate ancient texts. If any one is going to be the voice of logic and reason then it will have to be us, because it will most likely not be them. To play into the atheistic elitism that runs rampant here think of it this way; we are the peace loving intelligent ones and they are they savages. Play your part accordingly so that you breed a good opinion of us.
 The circle jerk that is r/atheism is more guilty of intolerance and hate than most Christians I know, and I know a very many. It is a perfect example of the pot calling the kettle black. I was raised in a christian home, attended a christian school K-12 and attended church 2 times a week through out my childhood. I swallowed what I was fed for a very long time, I only came to find atheism through my own desire for knowledge and in effort to find understanding in a world full of so many questions. I did not come to atheism through some little entitled, elitist, college junior atheist with a chip on their shoulder. Which is exactly what some of the people on this board come off as. If I had ran into one of these types during my quest to understand the world I can assure you I would not have been as likely to drop what I was taught my entire life in favor of "your beliefs".

 The exact things you fanatical atheists despise in fanatical theists are the same things you are guilty of. As an atheist in this country you are not persecuted or discriminated against in any significant way. I am not saying that it doesn't happen, I am saying it is very unlikely. So this analogy comes of as very skewed to me. We as atheists are not persecuted by theists in remotely the same way as non-whites are persecuted by the KKK. A theist may JUDGE you for being an atheist but so what? Everyone judges everyone, its human nature. Get over it. Being an atheist in america, hell even being an atheist in the bible belt is such a "first world problem" that it is just begging for a meme generator. 

 Don't act like we are poor persecuted little atheists. Be a good person and seek to educate those in those theists that choose to listen. Be kind, be educated, be patient. Do not hate, despise, or judge monotheistic believers, else you are guilty of the same things you dislike about them. 
Edit: poor grammar.
You don't know what you're talking about.
There's nothing wrong with the fundamentals of solar - your question "how often is it sunny" is nonsensical in two ways:
1) Where are you talking about?
2) "Sunny" doesn't matter very much. Solar panels work fine in overcast conditions (efficiency is reduced, but not that much).
Massive amounts of solar energy hit the earth (about 100W/square foot). Even at 20% efficiency (current PV panels achieve this) there is plenty of energy to harvest for existing panel tech to harvest.
The only problem is storage. The *ONLY* problem. And yes, current batteries are not up to the task. But there are many large improvements possible - some are practically guaranteed (i.e., demonstrated in the lab, and on their way to market), others are more speculative but there's nothing we know about physics to suggest it can't be done.
 Solar has huge potential. Existing panels are great. Batteries suck, but will improve.
Source: I've built and run several solar arrays.
I agree and understand where you're coming from.  Maybe it's just my perspective on life that makes me a little different from most.  I'm always thinking long term.  Every time I'm about to spend money on something, I visualize myself on my deathbed, remembering this exact moment in my mind.  Am I going to look back and give a fuck about the $20 I spent?  Probably not.  That's just me though.  Most people can't get out of the mindset of save, save, save and only purchasing the essentials.  I learned pretty early on though that life is too short and everything can be gone in a flash.  My dad always told me if I had the choice between skipping a meal to do something I really love, or having that meal, to always do the thing I love.  The body can survive for days without food.  The mind is the only thing telling you it can't.
Alright, that was a fucking tangent.  I'm a passionate mother fucker about video games.
I am currently 26. I work as a Freelancer for TV and other types of video shoots. My first job was the winter of 2009-2010. I was a Production Assistant and Boom Mic Operator for the TLC Series Mall Cops: Mall of America.
The west coast crew left for home, and I, a native of Minnesota was asked to stay and shoot (tape) a contest. I was thrilled at the opportunity to get to run camera on my first gig. One the fourth day of this contest, a man from New York had come to the Mall to commit suicide. Rather than using the parking ramp like most suiciders do, he decided to jump in the middle of the Mall's rotunda. Right where the contest was, right where I was working.
There was a big crashing sound as his femur hit one of the rails on the way down, causing him to spin and land head first. I did not see this happen, but heard from the Security Officers that this is how it happened. My first instinct was to grab the camera, but a PR person for the Mall said I could not shoot this kind of incident.
My next instinct was to help the Security staff. I had been working closely with them for the last few months, so I jumped up a level and started diverting people away from the incident. It took two hours for police to finish their investigation and the Mall to be able to clean up the mess.
Afterwards, the Security Director wrote a very nice e-mail to my boss on that job. I guess the Mall was worried we were going to make everyone look dumb, and the saw my actions as a way they could trust our crew. They approved a Season 2 right then. My boss was so thrilled with me, he took me to Kentucky to shoot Snake Man of Appalachia.
I am now moving to Los Angeles in a month, and I will have plenty of work waiting for me. Someone had to die for me to succeed, I guess.
*** Saw a guy right after his suicide jump in Mall of America.
I also saw my grandma pass away from Alzheimer's. 
I didn't see it directly, but I heard it. My dad shot himself in the head when I was 9. He came home, looked wild eyed and distant, with bloodshot eyes and a glazed look... I ran up to hug him, and my mom pulled me away and told me to go to my room. She had also told me before, if she ever came into my room in the middle of the night and told me to go, to just go. 
So I go to my room and pack a bag, and pretend to go to sleep... all the while I hear him fighting with her. I hear one gunshot (later learned he went outside and shot our chicken), another gunshot (shot the wall that went from their room towards my end of the house...it went through two walls before it stopped.) More arguing, another gunshot, then silence. 
I didn't dare leave my room... I honestly thought my dad had killed my mom. I pretended to be asleep when the police officer "woke" me up, took me into the living-room, and got me distracted by asking me to show him my drawings in my notebook. He did this to distract me that because they were wheeling my dad out of the house on a stretcher, under a sheet. I glanced out of the corner of my eye, and saw his wrist, watch, and hand. I didn't put it together that he was dead until later that night.
Much later, years later, I found out that my dad was coming around the bed, probably to shoot my mom, but he stopped to yell some more, something that led him to threaten to shoot himself, waved the gun around, it touched his head and it went off, the bullet grazed his skull, and he dropped. It's been almost 17 years, and my mom still has trouble telling that part.
*** - My dad shot himself, I heard it, and saw him being wheeled out under a sheet. I was 9.
Tons can be converted to loads, which can be converted to assloads by multiplying by the fecal constant, or to fuckloads by multiplying by the fornication constant.
Fuckloads can then be converted to fucking tons by multiplying by the fecal constant to get assfuckloads, which can then be converted into tons by subtracting 1 assfuck and multiplying by 2000.
The exchange rate is about 5.417 metric tons per fucking ton, but it varies daily
No idea what it was you said, exactly, but yes I do feel that forum is supposed to be dedicated to honesty.  However, honesty doesn't have to come with a complete lack of tact.  Were you overzealously harsh, mean, etc?  
Edit:  Your original response to the girl was "I'll pass."
Here are the rules in the sidebar for posting on /r/amiugly:
* Brutal honesty is a must, but at the same time have tact. :)
* No short unhelpful posts (e.g. "Ugly", "x/10", "Cute")! Be as constructive as possible. Offer improvements people can make to improve their appearance.
- Don't cry about getting banned when you can't read simple directions.
They do have filters, but the filters can be expensive, so the cheaper they are, the less powerful the IR filter will be, and the cheapest cameras don't have such a filter at all (you can actually buy other filters that let in only IR, and use them on most digital cameras to pick up "night vision" video caps).  Also, even the best filters can't block 100% transmission, so if you get them bright enough, say 0.5W, then they'll still be disruptive enough to obscure the video, especially if the frequency of the flash is timed to the recovery rate of the optic cell.
filters are expensive, LEDs are cheap
I don't know/care how it works in Canada.  I would say that when a protest makes the transition (in the determination of the police) from legal to illegal, that their should be an announcement made.  This is standard police procedure here and it is a reasonable system.  I have no problem with it.
That said, this reasonable system's weakness is that protesters inevitably claim they did not hear it.  I'm sure this causes legal consternation, but my gut is that when the DA wants to push it, charges are filed and people are tried and the jury gets to decide whether a lawful order was given or not.
 Cops should tell protesters when a protest becomes illegal, even though it's not a perfectly provable system. 
This monday, here, in Latvia in a protest against ACTA, a protester was arrested for wearing a mask and refusing to remove it after police asked him to. And to be fair, I find pretty standart. Anonimity tends to play with peoples minds, it could turn the protest aggressive, demolishing, this way failing to deliver the original message or at least give a reason to ignore it.
I don't see a reason why people in peaceful protests should wear a mask.
On the linked page Charmaine Borg has a very eloquent and readable response ([link](
&gt; Mr. Speaker, when examining the provisions of a bill, I think parliamentarians have a duty to ask themselves a simple question: will this bill improve our society? Today we are looking at Bill C-309, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (concealment of identity). I have no doubt that the author of this bill was motivated by a desire to improve public safety. That seems to be the answer the government automatically gives these days. Thus, members really need to ask themselves if this bill is an effective way to improve public safety.
&gt; Let us be clear: like all parties, the NDP condemns any vandalism and criminal behaviour at any assembly. Furthermore, we fully agree that any crime committed by someone wearing a mask deserves a tougher sentence. The NDP fully supports the sections of the Criminal Code that protect the public against seditious behaviour, vandalism and the masked individuals who commit these acts. What worries me, however, is the direction in which bills like this on public safety are taking us. I imagine this bill was drafted in response to the problem of crimes committed anonymously by people wearing masks during unlawful assemblies or riots.
&gt; No one is denying the troubling images that came out of the recent riots in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. In fact, I have a great deal of empathy for all the small businesses and shops that were damaged during these demonstrations. It is extremely sad, and I hope they will be compensated for this. In some cases, some of the offenders did indeed wear masks; I am aware of that. If this bill truly is a response to those events, then it is the responsibility of this House to determine whether it is a suitable and adequate response. Let us look at the content of this bill.
&gt; It proposes two very simple changes to the Criminal Code. Clause 2 of the bill calls for a change to section 65 of the Criminal Code making it a criminal offence to wear a mask or any other disguise when participating in a riot. The bill also proposes amending section 66 of the Criminal Code, which is essentially the same thing, but in the context of an unlawful assembly.
&gt; I want to come back to my original question: will this legislation improve our society? Changing our society for the better means recognizing a problem and being willing to solve it. As I was saying before, the NDP fully supports subsection 351(2) of the Criminal Code, which makes it an offence to cover one's face in the commission of a crime. The courts have recognized that wearing a mask during the commission of a crime can be considered an aggravating factor during sentencing. There are existing measures for handing down tougher sentences for an act committed by a criminal who wears a mask.
&gt; How will this bill help Canadians? Is the purpose of Bill C-309 to make it illegal to take part in a riot or unlawful assembly? In that case, Canadians are already protected by the Criminal Code. If the purpose of the bill is to introduce punitive measures against someone who commits a crime, such as vandalism, while taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly, Canadians are already protected by the Criminal Code, as I explained previously. If the purpose is to increase sentences for individuals who commit crimes while concealing their identity, once again, Canadians are protected by court decisions.
&gt; Under the Criminal Code, taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly and committing vandalism or other crimes during an unlawful assembly are already illegal, and concealing one's identity while committing a crime during an unlawful assembly or riot is considered to be an aggravating factor. Therefore, I question the need for this bill. I believe that it is basically redundant. The main issues of public safety that are the basis for this bill are already covered by the Criminal Code. This bill's only new contribution is to make it an offence to conceal one's identity while taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly.
&gt; According to this bill, an individual could be detained, arrested, indicted and sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison simply for being a masked spectator in the area of an unlawful assembly.
&gt; In June 2010, during the G20 in Toronto, Canadians witnessed how a small riot led to police crackdowns. The result: thousands of innocent people were arrested and detained. Approximately 1,500 Canadians were arrested or detained as a result of a riot involving fewer than 20 people. The authorities subjectively considered the whole demonstration as an unlawful assembly and took away the civil liberties of 1,500 innocent demonstrators, journalists and spectators. We must remember these events when we are considering a bill such as this one.
&gt; The limitations imposed on civil liberties to ensure public safety must be the least restrictive possible. I think that all the hon. members would agree with me on this. Otherwise, there is no limit to the restrictions that can be imposed on fundamental freedoms.
&gt; I would also like to point out that this bill takes away an individual's right to demonstrate anonymously. An individual is not necessarily going to commit a crime just because he or she is wearing a mask at a riot. It is reasonable to think that the person just wants to remain anonymous and protect his or her identity.
&gt; In the context of this bill, we must recognize the risk of political profiling of people exercising their civil liberties. Too often, 99% of protestors are peaceful, while 1% choose to vandalize. More often than not, this 1% is condemned by the vast majority of the peaceful protestors. As we saw in Toronto in June 2010, the peaceful protestors and spectators can be close to non-peaceful protestors. But this bill could lead to the arrest of innocent protestors who wear masks because of their geographic proximity to non-peaceful protestors.
&gt; It bears repeating that criminals who conceal their identity are already punished more severely in this country. I also want to point out that this bill would give judges the discretionary power under the Criminal Code to consider an offence committed while wearing a mask as an aggravating factor. Some people may consider that to be a good thing. However, a 2005 judgment by the Provincial Court of Alberta, R. v. Potter, already provides that protection.
&gt; I would like to thank the member for introducing this bill in the House. I understand the source of his concerns. However, in its current form, this bill is redundant and could have serious consequences for civil liberties in this country. I encourage members in this House to carefully examine the implications of this bill and to ask themselves whether it is worth jeopardizing our civil liberties. I am leaving it up to the House to decide on an appropriate course of action.
 Law is redundent and can be used to infringe on civil liberties in other areas.

Most of the comments here seen to be written w/o an appreciation of *context.*
Yes, we know laws against wearing face coverings @ protests have already been in place in various countries for decades.
And yes - on the surface - there seems to be some good reasons for having a law like this.
*The problem* is a contextual one, as to the political environment a law like this is appearing in, *and* the kinds of technology available to state officials, wealthy private bodies, etc.
This law is appearing in the midst of the global emergence of *popular, democratic uprising*.  It appears in an age of *increasingly reliable facial recognition software.*  And it is being proposed by a government that has *demonstrated* a keen interest in general "police state" measures, intentional abuse of law, and secrecy.
So shrugging and saying this is "no big deal" because some liberal social-democratic welfare states in western Europe established such measures 20-30 yrs ago **completely misses the point.**
*** - context, context, context.  Yes, *this IS bad.*
I used to pay 1B when I was a freshman in HS. Coach's kid decided he wanted to play baseball, so I got moved to right field and coach's kid got put in at first. First round of groundout drills, he misjudges a 6-3 throw and ends up taking a ball to the peepee. Next day, he trips chasing down a roller on his side of the grass and then cusses out the pitcher for not covering him when the ball was about four feet from the first base line. Couple days later he gets hit by a pitch from the pitching machine in our batting "cage" (basically a framework with nets everywhere instead of chainlink fence), throws his bat at the machine, and quits on the spot. Coach comes up to me after practice and asks me if I wanted to come back to 1B. I told him I kinda liked RF. That was a lie of course, I hated playing right field and it was one of the most boring experiences of my life, but it was worth it just to tell this dumbass to eat it.
**Dipshit coach replaces me with dipshit coach's dipshit kid. Dipshit kid can't catch, can't field, can't hit, and ragequat in just over a week.**
I'm in NROTC as well. Your MOI is just being a marine.
Run in the afternoons, since your PT is probs in the morning. 3x/week for starters, though if you can do 5x/week, do it.
Rant: MIDN in NROTC are retarded. They think they know everything about everything. I don't blame them; they're 18, given a uniform and a military ID and told they're doing god's work. If I had questions about lifting weights, I would 100% go to the guys in my battalion. But if I had questions about running, I wouldn't come near them. For some reason they think that doing 200m sprints 2x/week will make me good at a 1.5 mile run? I don't pretend to understand their logic.
 run daily. run moar. don't bother going particularly hard. you shouldn't be able to read a speech, but you should be able to converse with someone. make it sustainable.
That is an excellent, and difficult question.  It's not unlike "which is better, a small private college or a huge state university?"  Both have their pros and cons.  In an ideal career, you will spend some time at a few of each, and be able to develop your own preference.
The biggest risk, in my opinion, is that you avoid learning *the wrong lessons* from each sized company.  Bigger companies teach cynicism.  You end up working alongside 20- and 40-year industry veterans who are tired, tired, *tired* of the bullshit, and they unload their bitterness and hopeless soul-sucking vitriol on the fresh new enthusiastic greenhorn because they hate the fact that you still start the day with a smile.  They can turn you into one of them.  It's a genuine risk, like reading too much Dilbert and believing it represents the whole picture instead of one small, glum corner.
On the other hand, they tend to have fantastic benefit structures (like HR departments that can actually do their job), decent training opportunities, smooth travel reimbursements, pleasant facilities, and -- most important of all -- a well-trained and professional management cadre.  Big companies only stay big by knowing how to train and promote managers who actually have some concept of how to do their job (management).  It's *nice* to have a good manager, who's actually been to several years of management training and has 10+ years in managing employees.  Big companies monitor their manager effectiveness closely, and don't tolerate too much crap (there are plenty of mid-level applicants waiting to fill their shoes, so they can demote poor performers back into the ranks with no risk at all).
Finally, a major risk at any large company is that *you may never leave*.  This happens *a lot*: people get comfortable.  They get increasingly skilled in an increasingly tiny niche field and 3 years turns into 7 turns into 15 and suddenly you start to think the world's passing you by, you've walled yourself into a crevice with no out, but now you're *afraid* to leave because you've haven't updated your resume in 15 years and you haven't sat the other side of an interview desk in ages and you're literally terrified to leave your job because you've forgotten how to look for another one.  I've seen this happen to bright, skilled, talented engineers over and over and over.  Beware the comfortable roost.
*On the other hand*...small companies have their issues too.  Their HR departments often suck, which can actually affect you when you're trying to get a W-2 reprint or hardcopy paystubs for employment verification or detailed questions about your health plan or whatever.  Worse, in my opinion, is that they often have wide fluctuation in the quality and caliber of their managers.  Many were promoted up from technical or other "individual contributor" roles, and have absolutely no idea how to manage effectively.  Small companies provide little support for fledgling managers to learn their trade, so they tend to be...well, just very bad at their jobs, in a huge variety of ways: under-communicative or over-communicative, never-there or always-there, brutally abusive or uselessly soft, whatever.
From this experience you can learn a variety of bad things: you can be brow-beaten into thinking you're a worthless sack of shit (saw it happen to a guy last week), you can fail to grow and expand for lack of the encouragement and nurture and training opportunities you genuinely deserve, and worse you can come to believe this is NORMAL, dooming yourself to a lifetime of repeat experiences because you apply your now-twisted dysfunctional expectations to every future manager, who by-God will achieve them...and *worst* of all, you may actually *absorb* the behaviours you witness, and go on to torture others by repeating the same sick mechanisms.
Of course, small companies have real plusses too.  Theoretically, they are able to double their sales, then *double* them again, and again and again...a trick no large company can possibly pull off.  You can go from being employee #15 of a 15-man operation to #15 of a 15,000-man behemoth (I've seen it happen, though unfortunately not to me).  Because *everyone* wears lots of hats, you learn lots of hats: everyone does some tech, some admin, some sales, some customer support...sometimes you run out and bring lunch, sometimes you vacuum up at the end of the day, sometimes you place orders for 50 new servers, sometimes you explain to the venture capitalists why their million-dollar advertising campaign fell through (that one, sadly, was me).  It's an exciting rush.  You may go weeks without sufficient sleep.  You'll almost certainly never see a dime of the stock options you're promised, so negotiate most of your salary in cash.
Between the two, I would have to recommend starting with the smaller company, for one simple reason: it won't last.  Small companies fail, or get sold, or move to San Diego, or (frequently) get bought by larger companies, and you end up working for a big company in spite of yourself.  The point is, almost no small company *stays* small -- they're non-sustainable.  They either grow or are subsumed or they die.  And that's why if you start with a small, you'll eventually get a chance to try big as well (perhaps on the rebound), whereas if you start big, you may never see the light of small.
;TL:DR: I loved your question, as it's something I've asked myself many times during my career ;-)
I ordered the same thing as OP a couple weeks back.  Tried the Boba's first and absolutely loved it. My plan was to use half the bottle and switch to the Gorilla Juice to allow them both to steep before I fully judged the flavors.  My first impression of the Gorilla Juice was that its not bad but nowhere near Boba's.  Its got a decent all day vape but sometimes the fake banana flavor really sneaks up on you.  Reminds me of a banana flavored Runts Candy.  BTW, all my testing has been done on resurrectors from CCV with 3.7v ego batteries.
 gorilla juice not bad but bobas bounty really shines.
Not just fuck the poor, fuck the middle class into being poor. 
Their economic policies are pure shit for hard working (once upwardly mobile) people. 
And now they want to guarantee pregnancy on top of it? Yeah, that's exactly how you prevent poverty. These people fucking suck. And I'm going to straight up declare that anyone who isn't already wealthy that supports this shit is a self destructive fool. The already wealthy that support it are fucking selfish assholes. 
We've had decades of trickle down economics. The results are in, and they aren't good. 
Signed, 
Once very upwardly mobile, now scratching and clawing just to stay middle class. 
 Yeah, I'm pissed off. 
*Shark Week*?  Hadn't heard that one before, lol.  That's a keeper.
I don't think telling the politicians would help, did you see the panel they interviewed?  Nary a double X to be found,  as far as I could see.   They just don't care and seem dead set committed to maintaining some semblance of the misogynist status quo.   
Many idiots in politics. 
Moral of the story: Santorum equates birth control with promiscuity. Never mind those of us who are married but think having 19 children is frankly irresponsible or who use these meds to manage quality of life due to literally debilitating menstrual pain every month (can you imagine giving up 3 days of your life every month for 45 years to worship the porcelain god for 72 hours solid?) or even worse, avoid miscarriage after miscarriage due to infertility issues tied to that same menstrual pain. Personally, I'd like to kick Santorum in the jimmy. Over and over and over... Oh, and cut off his supply of Viagra until he undergoes mandatory sterilization. 
 Women use bc for many reasons unrelated to promiscuity. Oh, and I'm for Santorum's personal sterilization.
Thought this would be helpful, 
     Since many of the people using the bible as a means of moral justification quote from the old testament especially Leviticus then they should be following the 600 something laws in Leviticus. Several of these laws concern a women's menstrual cycle. In Judaism/ the Old Testament any fluid leaving the body is considered unclean(with the exception of tears) so because of this during a womans menstrual period she is supposed to be isolated or put away until it is over and then she has to go through a ritual purification of herself (its supposed to be like a really nice spa). So if Santorum believes firmly in one part of Leviticus he should also be locking his wife away whenever she is on her period
according to old testament Santorum should isolate his wife whenever she starts her period cause she is unclean
Only somewhat related: I wonder sometimes if simile and analogy resonate or mean as much to some people. Like I know moderately educated ppl get the basic premise, but does this sort of argument really just not resonate with social conservatives? Are some people unable to see the value of these sorts of comparisons? Does it truly seem superfluous to them? Am I misinterpreting the strength and validity of this analogy? Sorry for the rant. Just curious. It seems like there's a discrepancy in the very language and logistics on both sides of arguments like this. I admi tot a sort of liberal bias, but are we not even speaking the same language, using the same rhetorical devices, thinking in nearly the same way? This all presupposes that those that are anti-birth control, wouldnt be anti-seatbelt if the opportunity presented itself. An assumption that may have a flaw in and of itself. I'm just tremendously unsettled sometimes about this stuff. /end rant
 I wonder if this argument even really translates. 
I use treble hooks.  My biggest issue with power bait is that it covers and sticks on the treble hooks so well and it gets slimy in the water so when I go to reel a fish in it tends to just slip out of their mouths.  I can even see the impression of the inside of their mouths on the bait.
So when I use power bait I use treble hooks mold it like you said in a ball so that it isn't pyramidal shaped, which tends to help the bait slip out of the mouth of the fish.  Also, like others have said, check to make sure that bait floats your hook off the bottom!!!  
I then make sure I am ready to keep any fish that I hook and I use a really slack line.  When I see a fish start taking out line I just open the bail and let them keep taking line forever.  My idea is that it needs to go down their throat to ensure a positive hook set, when I use power bait I am not looking for a lip hook, I am more looking for an anus hook.  I have never actually waited for them to poop the hook out, but they usually swallow it and that treble stick really good in the throat/gullet.  
After I can't wait anymore, I give a nice gentle hook set and reel the fish in.  Then I put the fish on the stringer, and just cut the line as close to the hook as possible and tie on another hook.  Later on when I clean the fish I retrieve the hooks for later use.
 Use treble hooks, but give the fish plenty of line in order for them to swallow the hook completely.
You're on the right track with the NOT picking (I recommend even putting up a sign next to your mirror to stop you). Water, less dairy and more sleep are all good too, but nothing does it like leaving them a alone as long as you can so that you don't push bacteria back into the skin. If the zit is really surfaced and such, take a warm wash cloth and hold it on there for a minute and then with the PADS of your fingers you can pop it. As to products, benzoyl peroxide works really well for me, but some people maybe not so much. I really recommend acne.org- Daniel Kern's products. You don't need to go too strong with the benzoyl- 2.5% is plenty strong and allows you to put on a little more than you could if you went stronger concentrate. It helps prevent and treat the redness, swelling and bacteria. It will dry your skin out so i'd recommend that you put it on twice a day for the first week and then less the next week and then stop like the day before and lotion up before you see her. It can bleach certain fabrics also so FYI and wash your hands after putting it on and let it absorb.
TL:DR:
Be GENTLE to your skin, use benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, mild lotion (like Cetaphil brand), and TRY to eliminate stress for the next week, get lots of sleep and maybe exercise a little (helps with stress as well as gets skin more circulation). 
Maximum upvotes for the earplugs (1). The most underrated piece of concert gear. Screw any haters, if you wear them you are not a dweeb, you are being smart.
The volume at ANY rock concert is "too damn high". I don't know about the venue, but if it's like any metal concert I've been to, it's probably the loudest sustained noise you will ever experience, unless you work in an industrial environment.
The "dampening" or tinnitus you may experience after the show is temporary. Your hearing adapts to the sound levels. However, abuse of your ears causes permanent hearing damage which initially may be imperceptible but will gradually pile up over the years. You will start losing frequencies and you may get annoying permanent tinnitus - medicine can't do anything about it. 
Everyone working there, unless already deaf (that includes technicians, musicians, etc) wears plugs because it saves their valuable sense of hearing and helps them hear the music instead of a jumbled wall of sound.
Musician's earplugs do not attenuate the high frequencies as much as regular foam plugs thus they are better for listening to music. May be slightly more expensive, but they can be cleaned and last a long time.

 PROTECT YOUR HEARING. DO NOT EVER FORGET YOUR EARPLUGS. MUSICIAN'S EARPLUGS IF POSSIBLE.
&gt;Ireland was in 1939 nominally a dominion of the British Empire and a member of the Commonwealth. The nation had gained de facto independence from Britain after the Anglo-Irish War, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a 'sovereign, independent, democratic state'. A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions. Relations between Ireland and Britain had been strained for many years; until 1938 the two states had engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War.[1]
&gt;Nevertheless, Ireland did not sever its vestigial connection with the Crown and it was not until the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 that the final nominal link was severed. No representatives of the new state attended Commonwealth conferences or participated in its affairs, but Ireland remained a legal member until the British Ireland Act 1949, which accepted the declaration of a Republic and formally terminated its membership of the Commonwealth.
- They were still technically a part of the British commonwealth until 1949, but LanaLanaLanaaaa is probably correct that I'm using "Britain" more loosely than intended
I was referring to the charities and adoption agencies. Not to the general thread. If the church takes money from the taxpayer to run an adoption agency, they do not have the right to flaunt discrimination laws. No matter what they may think of those laws, they either get to have the money, or run the programs strictly according to church law. 
Your beliefs do not trump the Constitution, get over it.
Atheist visitor here.  Very gratifying to see Christian redditors' attitudes on this issue, and thought you might be interested in the views of a Mormon I recently engaged with.
I challenged him to explain why his church poured millions of dollars into California to support Prop 8 (outlawing gay marriages).  He claimed if same-sex marrige becomes legal, the church might be sued for refusing to marry same-sex couples.
I told him that was utterly ridiculous, that no one can sue a church for declining to marry them, and he fell back on, "Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it won't."
Clearly this is what someone in his church told him, but wow, how pathetic -- and how brainwashed this guy had to be in order to buy such a nonsensical argument.
The Mormon church is scary.
First of all please don't do ballistic(bouncing) stretches. At all. Ever. Studies since the 80s have consistently shown that they don't give better results than static or dynamic stretches, they only increase the chances of injury.
Second, here's how you're supposed to do it:
Pre-workout: you do some dynamic stretches after the warm up IF your sport/activity demands it, like gymnastic or martial arts. If you're running or biking, you want your muscles tight so it's not necessary, and actually static stretches pre-workout can decrease your performance slightly(about 5%).

Post-workout: this is where you do your static stretches, now that you're all warm and tired (more relaxed). You hold each position for an about 30 seconds while taking deep breathes. Lower your stretch on expiration.

This is very basic and it will fit most athletes. To answer your actual question, how long it will take depends on a number of factors: how often you stretch(everyday is best, but 3-4 times a week is very reasonable), for how long, how well you perform the stretches, your life habits(do you sit all the time?), your genes(damn those!), your age, your diet... much like anything in fitness, really. 
In your case, it's probably gonna take a long time... sorry. You're heavy, tall(most tall people I know are stiff as a board, I don't know why exactly) and not very flexible to begin with. If you're very consistent with your stretch, you should see decent results within 6 months, depending on which muscles you train and how. 
Keep in mind that flexibility is... fickle. More so than most other fitness variables. Someday you're just not as flexible as usual, simply because you didn't hydrate enough, or it's colder outside, or you just slept in a funny position last night. And it's not like strength where you can put a number on it.
As a last note, if you want to get serious about stretching, check out isometric stretches: they're hard and difficult, but you'll progress faster. The best two books about that are: *Stretching Scientifically* by Thomas Kurz and *Relax into Stretch* by Pavel Tsatsouline.
***: Warm-up; dynamic stretches; workout; static(or isometric) stretches. No ballistic, ever. 6 months. Good luck.
Why did the lines about me/AutoModerator rate being part of the  They're pretty much completely off-topic from the "big reveal" here.
Ok, let's make something clear though...

Digg had many problems, but the one that broke the camel's back was the decision to change to V4. As pointed out previously, Digg survived for a LONG time with users like mrbabyman submitting all kinds of shit and collecting diggs, but the system is inherently different here. In fact, even the description of a power user is totally different between digg and reddit. 
For one, power users in Digg became power users because of the friending system. If you added someone as a friend, you saw all of their posts. Babyman had tens of thousands of friends that would immediately see all his shit and updigg it to the front page - even if that meant that he re-posted it from some other lowly user.
Having one user be a mod in every single subreddit here wouldn't even come close to the same type of issue, and unless reddit goes through a huge site overhaul that changes all of the frontpage content into one big blog RSS feed, then reddit is safe and there's no need to have a cow over this... 
- Digg died because of site redesign which caused the democratic system to completely fail. That is not what is happening here. Period. 
Why does everything have to seem all sketch-ball? Mainstream media is sketchy.  Digg. Sketchy. Reddit. Sketch pad. Facebook twitter wiki leaks sketch sketch and sketch. 
 Shit's sketchy. 
Just an FYI, sometimes transmission flushes on higher-mileage cars do more harm than good. I'm assuming you're driving an automatic transmission car. Over time, the microscopic metal shavings from your clutch packs get in the trans fluid. These actually help your clutch packs grip as they age. Sometimes transmission flushes remove this "grit" the old fluid has to it, and makes your clutch packs slip. Just do a drain and fill. I guarantee that at $200, they're just in it to rip you off.
 Trans flushes are a waste of money.
At the time, Washington State wasn't self insured, that is to say the state bridges were still insured by some company like PEMCO or what have you. The agent the state went through didn't think that a brand new bridge would collapse in 4 months, so he pocketed the monthly payments. So when the State went to get the money to rebuild the bridge...you can guess what happened.
EDIT: [Source](
Some insurance guy pocketed the money for the bridge and was outed when the 4-month-old bridge collapsed. 
it's dom, like it matters
but seriously this is why they need to add ranked dom so people that want to play it seriously like you can.
not me though, i play nidalee in most my dom matchs (+40 wins atm) and have fun just chucking spears all game. usually i place 1st or 2nd but i just do it for fun.
maybe you should find a character you enjoy just playing in the mean time?
 riot needs to add ranked dominion
As much as I love to hate on proximity mines for their lack of triggering on enemy proximity... they are quite useful against armor. They fire straight at your target and do decent damage on impact. 
shoot them at Atlases
She is Right.  Also, what she's doing is totally insane.
I was in your position a 7 or 8 years ago.  I got into my dream college, and my high school girlfriend went to a state school about 6 hours (drive) away, with no flight options to speak of.  To make matters worse, I didn't have a car.  
So, we continued on with the long-distance thing for a little more than a year, but it really is pretty impossible at that time in your life.  You want to party more, and go out with no worries, but the only way to keep the relationship up is to be in fairly constant contact.  I ended up becoming a slave to my phone, always picking up when she called, and not enjoying my "college experience."  It was like living 2 lives.
Shortly after this, we broke up, but still talked very regularly, still said "i love you," etc... This lasted for a few years -- we both dated around during this time, but it only made it more clear that we were right for each other.  When you connect with someone at that level, it makes everyone else's attempts at making that connection with you seem (almost) laughable.  Of course, there were several "crazies" who also helped me decide this girl was for me.
Fast-forward to today, and we've happily together for some time (ended up in the same place,) and our relationship is better for it.  Not engaged yet, but I bought the ring over 6 months ago, and am just waiting to figure out the right way to ask.
 I agree, it sucks.  Things might work out for you.  They might not, but they might.
Perhaps we're of different generations.  (Maybe this is why I spend almost more time on Malefashionadvice than femalefashionadvice!  The men seem a little older!)  But some people say *fashion* is the art of keeping up with the trends, of making sure to spend a bazillion hours a week researching blogs and websites, and running yourself ragged making sure to always have the latest stuff.  On the other hand, *style* might be defined as the art of expressing one's personality through clothing choices, something that might not change as much from one decade to the next.  So while fashion magazines and websites might be important if you're in your teens and twenties and are interested in wearing the latest neon colors, books become more important for those old enough to realize neon is not very flattering on 99% of those with European skin coloring.  Here are a few things I've learned from books:
1.) How do I dress for my particular shape?  (How can I minimize a large bust / enhance a small bust?  Make my legs look longer?  Appear taller?)  Waistlines go up and down with trends, for example but if you know what looks good on you (say, empire waists), you'll purchase several items in empire waists in classic, solid colors while they're on trend to make it through the drought when they're not.  Good tailoring for your body in particular is part of this; tailoring seems to be discussed a great deal more in books than in magazines and websites.  Choosing colors best for your skintone also might be something books can help with.
2.) What materials are best for me?  If you're still in your teens and twenties, you might still purchasing the polyester junk from Forever 21 and H&amp;M.  But as you age, you begin to appreciate the comfort and breathability of real cotton, silk, and wool.  Polyester has indeed improved since the '70's, but it still doesn't float like real silk, nor will it keep you both warm and cool like wool, which wicks away sweat amazingly well.  Books can be great for emphasizing real quality in materials and stitchery; magazines tend to focus more on who designed something instead of the seamstress who sewed it up.  (Yes, good designers tend to use good quality materials on average, but some start out with a famous name brand, and then start making crap.  I looked at a whole bunch of Calvin Klein suits recently at Macy's.... they were all polyester!)
3.) A little black dress has been popular since Audrey Hepburn.  Burberry gave us the trench coat.  A striped tee has been popular since Coco Chanel.  Brands like Old Navy and Ralph Lauren have built their entire lines around the nautical feel Chanel gave us!  As Urthwhyte says, it's great to know a little about history so you can know what pieces are classic and spend real money on something that will never go out of style.  And yes, that does indeed change!  Charmian Carr (Liesl) was encouraged to spend her earnings from The Sound of Music on a fabulous fur coat, which would "never go out of style."  And then animal rights activists started pouring things on and throwing things at people who wore them, and things changed.  But in general, there are some things that have stayed the same, and it's nice to know how to pick out a good pair of classic black pants that I can wear with that blouse that simply doesn't go with anything else.  
  Magazines and websites are great for following what's currently *trendy*.  Books are great for figuring out which shapes and colors are best for you, what makes a quality garment, and what sorts of things might be more classic, that you can wear forever.
Absolutely nothing is wrong with you. The truth is everyone feels like that, at least sometimes. I could say that you are just over thinking things and need to relax. But don't let anyone tell you there is something wrong with you. I would say very few people have life "figured out."
Now if you feel like indecision or low self-esteem is impacting your daily life then there is always the possibility of talking to someone, such as a psychiatrist. Seeing one doesn't mean you are crazy.
TLDR - You are normal
Nothing too exciting. Some psycho kid had a knife and I tried to stop him before someone got hurt. Well, he ended up stabbing my hand (like I said, nothing too exciting). It was a small folding knife right between my thumb and forefinger, and it went really deep. I didn't even feel pain at first, just looked down and saw a *lot* of blood. I did end up getting the knife from him though, so, mission accomplished?
*tl/dr*: got stabbed in the hand like a bitch.
I was at a party where a bunch of guys were running around with pellet guns and ran out of ammo. Later, a jerk dropped acid and started breaking car windows. I was an idiot and confronted him. He pulled a gun in the middle of the street, jammed it in my nose and threatened to kill me. I call him an ass, and slap,what I assumed to be one of the empty pellet guns, out of his hand. It hit the ground with a sick thunk instead of the clatter of an empty pellet gun. Everyone at the party scattered- WHOOOM- gone. I made it to the back yard and someone put a trash can over my head and hid me until the police got there.
I was an idiot.
*edit for spelling
  Mine is interesting.. about 6 years ago me and few friends liked to be trouble making teenagers, and we routinely went out of town about 15 mins or so to a grid road that lead to a supposed 'haunted' church that looked to be atleast from the early 1900's. Now, this road was a dead end about 5km long, with about 3 or so farm houses along the way. A bit of back story is needed for this tale of woe.
  The final house was a farmer who owned the church property about half a kilometer away. He had a sixth sense about knowing when kids were showing up and going inside his church. It was his duty, I suppose, to kick people out with threats and sometimes bringing a baseball bat and chasing you to the highway with his car. And we had our fair share of times of this happening to us, and us being punks and harrassing him back with honking our horns and doing doughnuts on the road outside his house late at night. 
  Now on this clear and nice october night, one of my friends brought a couple of fireworks, and as we stood outside the church chatting, he set 3 off and we thought nothing of it. They were little tiny fireworks that just made a decently loud pop at the end. When we finished that we were ready to go and hopped into our cars, my ford festiva, and my friends firebird. There was 5 of us packed into the cars. And as we turned to head towards the highway we see lights coming from that direction!
  Now our first thought was the farmers brother who lived that way on the same road, and our first instinct was to drive up the side of this small hill off the road and hide in the darkness with our cars. We do that, and its about 10ft higher than the road level, and we think he didnt see. He did. The truck pulls up facing his lights on us and we know we are caught. But no one gets out.. and soon we see two more sets of lights coming down the road.. then three.. then four. They all angle their lights at our cars and we are thinking that they got friends together to kick our asses!
  "STEP OUT OF YOUR CARS, ONE BY ONE, WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD AND WALK BACKWARDS SLOWLY TO MY VOICE" came the voice from the loud speaker. I was first to obey, and I get out and follow the orders, made it to the voice and get handcuffed and turned around to 7 RCMP with pistols, shotguns, and a rifle pointed at me and my friends cars where I had just walked from. My friends comply as well.
  Farmer called police saying people were shooting guns at his house. Guns. Our 3 fireworks. Couldn't believe it! It was a huge misunderstanding about 20 mins before we were uncuffed and left to go on our way with no warnings or scoulding. 
Edit: Not going to try and correct all punctuation and grammatical errors.
- RCMP misinformed and took all precautions with an array of weaponry.
It definitely had to do with the backing up the car. If the guy was wanted, then the police roll up, the situation is tense. If you start backing up, toward the cop, you have now implied to the cop you are planning on running, and quiet possibly are going to use your car as a weapon (think 2 ton bullet). Cop is now in a very tense situation, so he must take control.
*** Only thing the cop knows is that someone has identified the driver as a wanted criminal, and then the identified criminal starts moving two and a half tons of metal toward the officer. 
This reminds me of that [scene in The Royal Tenenbaums]( where grandpa kidnaps his long-lost grandsons for the sole purpose of showing them the visceral experience of "being a kid".  It gets a bit out of hand, but its tongue in cheek to drive the point home.
This scene really stuck out for me because my grandpa lived around the corner from me for most of my life, and he was never really my "grandpa" at all (similar to Royal in this movie, however, Royal redeems himself well here).  Growing up without my father around, I really looked to him for this kind of stuff, but quickly learned he was not interested.  When I was a kid, he made me cry more times than he made me smile, and took me to a total of 3 Detroit Tigers games during the 80's (the ONLY time he ever did anything with me for the sake of doing so).
I'm 33 yo, and to this day, my grandpa is still one of the biggest **pricks** I know.  I've recently tried to mend our relationship by taking him to a few Tiger games, but it hasn't worked.  Now he only calls me when he wants Tiger tickets because of my connections, and doesn't care whether I can go or not.  The last time we went to a game we just ended the night with a long, drawn out arguement.
Sorry this became long and sort of off topic, but I can't wait to have this much fun with my boys in a few years.
**I wish my grandpa would have done these sort of things with me when I was a kid.  I will never deprive my two sons of these childhood experiences.**
You present your arguments in an easy to understand format. A lot of people here will still ignore the plain facts in-front of them and claim that Day 1 DLC is cheating them. Any claim that this makes the game incomplete makes no sense, they can't prove it has any significance beyond a reasonable doubt.
You need multi-player as an incentive to buy new because frankly anyone who buys used or rents is stealing from the developer and publisher, there is no way around that, you really shouldn't have access to the game at all if you rent or buy used.
 There is no logical reason to see the game as incomplete with such little proof that the content actually matters.
Maintenance cost is all relative. If you compare two high end cars with an equivalent amount of things to break on either car, then maintenance should be similar. However, BMW parts are severely marked up relative to a lot of japanese parts. Let me give you an example.
O2 sensors for the E36 3 Series (92 to 99) were made by NTK (japanese company), sold to Bosch (German company) and then sold to BMW -&gt; AND THEN sold to you at the parts counter. That is 3 markups. I have an O2 sensor in front of me now. It is stamped with NTK, Bosch and BMW. Things like that make BMW parts really expensive. This little guy goes for 400+ at your dealer but only 110~ on Pelican Parts.
Your oil changes are expensive. Big engine + synthetic = expensive. Any old car tends to be more expensive to maintain partially because normal things stop working (ie e-brakes) due to rust. And when shops try to wrench the bolts off of your car but have them round out because they're rusted in, they charge more for labour since it takes them a long time to get everything out.
A BMW is more expensive but you can minimize the premium by sourcing used parts from scrapyards + online dealers, doing DIYs and finding a BMW which has very minimal rust.
&gt; Not sure if you intentionally lied about being "kicked from another
&gt; server" but it sure looks that way.
... and I would gain what by doing this? Perhaps it was the same server, and I ended up assuming it was different? That would make a whole lot more sense. And if that's the case (likely,) then I've made a mistake. There is a difference between intentional lies and unintentional mistakes.
&gt;  Op is probably lying.
Wow!
Be careful there. You don't want to put too many amps through a string of Christmas lights.
The Christmas lights are designed not to supply power to the outlet at the end, but to light the lamps along it. The socket at the end is simply to extend the string of lights with more lights.
If you overload a string of Christmas lights, you'll heat up the wires. Because copper (well, anything really) tends to become more resistive as it gets hotter, it'll absorb more power and get even hotter -- it's a vicious cycle. Eventually, the cord will get hot enough to start a fire, or to melt the insulation and shock someone.
This means that if you want to plug something into a string of Christmas lights, it has to be something small. Phone charger? Ok. Floor-standing halogen lamp? That's asking for trouble. Space heater? You better be joking.
** Get a proper extension cord and only put as many amps through it as it's rated.**
knowing when to Baron is a decision that I think should be left to the jungler it makes it easy to decide when and when not to Baron and leaves no questions from the team. When advantage is had the most important thing is that everybody on the team move together and do the same thing.  Any jungler worth his (or her) salt should be studying gameplay and recognize what to do when. Does the jungler say Baron? No? Do something else, solves the problem right away.
if jungler says baron, do baron, if not, don't. 
I lived in D dorm last year, which wasn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Yes, it is the quiet dorms and you can't bump music *mega* loud during the day (though I did daily with two complaints the whole year) and once it is a certain time, you have to be a little more mindful, but it was still pretty awesome. I could always find a party when I wanted one, but I could also get to sleep no problem. The "quiet" in quiet dorms is enforced basically by whether you are being blatantly disrespectful OR if people complain. The nice thing is how easy it is to get a singly in D dorm. You are almost guaranteed one.
****A dorm is kind of nice because laundry is on the bottom floor and whatnot, B dorm smells like ass and is nothing to be proud of, C dorm is pretty awesome and was a good balance of lively and level-headed, and D was great if you are okay not being an asshole 24/7 in terms of noise.
The Queen is the HEAD OF STATE but not the HEAD OF GOVERNMENT. She does a lot of the for-the-cameras diplomatic stuff, ceremonies, receptions, etc. But her tangible political power is nearly nonexistent. She can tell people what she thinks about issues if she wants, but anyone can do that. The only time I recall she actually had a political decision to make was after the last election with the first coalition government in forever, because without a clear winner nobody knew who got to go first (the previous government or the party with the plurality in the election?). 
 Queen does stuff, but mostly ceremonial stuff and doesn't have any codified political power
South Philly has been a parking free-for-all/anomaly for a long time. There is just about enough street parking for everyone, but you have to get creative. I park on a small side street with two wheels up on the sidewalk, and parking enforcement just lets us so we don't take up the whole street. South of Snyder used to be a huge mess where everyone would double park and no one got ticketed before the city converted much of it to back-in parking. The middle of broad reflects the rest of the parking situation: If your car fits, sometimes parking there is okay as an unwritten rule if you aren't causing traffic or pedestrian problems. The middle of broad is not really useful as a turning lane where people tend to park anyway.
 South philly drivers and ticketers have a lot of unwritten agreements on where, specifically, it is okay to park despite written law.
Furthermore, that's not historically accurate.  The American revolution was about democracy if you were poor, or tax evasion if you were rich.  The constitutional convention was actually specifically transferring more power to the federal government.  This is why we don't remember the presidents before George Washington, because they weren't constitutional presidents and had little power at all.  That system didn't work, so they changed it and made the constitution.  The constitution is about transferring more power to a centralized system, and the bill of rights to both get common citizens on board and to make sure that America doesn't make England's mistakes of oppression.
  The constitution was actually about granting more federal power and civil rights.
I also love your dumb ass comment on YouTube:
"Made a good deal﻿ of money then got a name for themselves, then they blow off the game that got them there. I know that a large part of the Terraria community will not be buying Starbound to sorta, fill the void, now that terraria is gone."
Yeah, they made money, so one of them left to create another team to create a game HE wanted to make himself to make a lot of people happy, and the other ends up wanting to take more time for his family instead of focusing on developing a tiny indie game to please a bunch of people who feel like they are entitled to endless updates. Give the guy a fucking break, kid.
Grow the fuck up and realize people have lives and that you are entitled to shit. You paid for an indie game. You got an indie game. Shut the fuck up about it.
You know a large group of people who won't buy Starbound because of Redigit not working on Terraria anymore? You know that Starbound isn't his game? You know it's not the same development team? You know it's a new group of people with Tiyuri making a game they want to make and that they think a lot of fans of Terraria will like because of some similar aspects?
Making dumb ass statements like you and people not interested in Starbound and not purchasing it strictly because of Redigit not working on Terraria anymore is one of the dumbest things I have ever read.
You're fucking stupid.
&gt;*,
&gt;  After reviewing the causes of action in which we are acting upon I believe it would not be in my best interest to settle the case without just compensation.  In the original petition we were suing for,
&gt;1. Return of vehicle per Texas Business &amp; Commerce Code 2A.519;
&gt;2. Actual damages;
&gt;3.  Statutory damages;
&gt;4. Exemplary and punitive damages;
&gt;5. Attorney's fees in an amount not less than $5000.00;
&gt;6. Costs of suit; and
&gt;7. Such other relief to which Plaintiff may show himself entitled;

&gt;I filed suit with no intentions of ever doing business with * Infiniti again. With 9+ causes of action, and many examples of evidence that they acted maliciously or with ill intent, I believe we have a solid case that should be pursued. I do not want this business to profit in any way from this transaction, and many variables since September, 28th 2011 have changed that do not merit entering into the same deal with the dealership.

&gt;1.    Having been almost 5 months, the car has depreciated greatly since the time of signing the lease. I entered into the contract with the intent to lease and keep a new vehicle, not to lease and have stolen from my possession for four months, and then returned.
&gt;2.  I would not have taken the time to file a lawsuit for a deal that was afterwards brought to my attention to be fraudulent. The dealership would not have been willing to work with me, if I at a later date discovered that the price I purchased the car at was vastly different than the price I was originally shown on my first visit to the dealership on 9/20/2011
&gt;3. The botched deal in this arrangement has caused much grief in my family; my grandparents should not be put through potentially the same trouble as before and have to bear through even more lies by the dealership.  Their original signature that they will testify to should be the only one needed, and I will not strain my relationship with them even more by asking for another.
&gt;4. I have had individuals from other car dealerships through casual conversation comment on how Crest had no grounds to repossess the vehicle after a signed agreement was made, and that I should end up owning the car.
&gt;5.  With the level of humiliation, intimidation, and verbal degradation Crest Infiniti used through the course of our transaction, I do not see how anyone would be expected to enter into another transaction and allow the place of business to profit off said transaction. The dealership will make money on the car, regardless of reducing the price to invoice as car dealerships get kickbacks on financing.
  &gt; With their reckless use of my and my grandfather's credit information I cannot insure that I will not encounter more issues in the future even if the current inquiries can be removed. They without my permission used my credit information after I was informed that I had been approved with Infiniti Financial. They then showed my private credit information to parties unrelated to the original transaction without my permission.

&gt;With these variables I feel that by resuming the transaction, and acting like the events never happened would only cause me to lose out. They were given multiple chances before to resolve the issue and did not do so.  I have spent additional time and money pursuing this case, and feel that even in civil claims court there would be more compensation then just having the original deal returned to me.
&gt;I believe that the whole conversation between my grandmother and Infiniti financial is not factual. There is no way that this was my grandmother, and she will even testify to the fact that this was not her, plus she was with us at the dealership on the day we signed the contract and assisted with the credit application. She even submitted her own signature to the dealership to become a cosigner herself when they rejected me and my grandfather together. Even at that, the issue was between the finance company and the dealership and with a signed contract and the cashing of my check I believe the deal should've been set in stone regardless of the issues they encountered on their end.  The spot delivery agreement was expired when they contacted me to get the car back, and even at that it was not correctly filled out so therefore should be invalid.

&gt;I am interested in what you would recommend to be a counter offer to the dealership, excluding resuming a lease transaction with them. I am still open to settlement talks with the dealership as a show of good faith, even though I have doubts any results would be obtained by talks with the man that previously talked with such contempt towards me before I filed suit. I feel that it would only be a method for them to try and intimidate me into a decision that would be of benefit to them. But, I am not against attempting to do so as a matter of record for the court.

&gt;Best Regards,
*
She has not even tried with this suit, my attorney literally filed papers that I would not be beyond filing, and when they offered to pay her fees decided to bail.
 Car dealership rips me off, I sue. They offer the same deal, I decline. My attorney withdraws counsel.
Ok thank you for bringing this to the forefront of my mind. What an awkward first time.
So there I am with my girlfriend,about to actually perform the act of intercourse. We're sleeping on the pull out bed in my friend's living room. I'm laying on top of her,head in slowly sliding in the rest of the way and the door to the house opens. What the fuck was that we think? It's my friend's brother coming in,no big deal. He'll go straight to his room as he's an anti-social bastard anyway and then we continue. No,of course that's not what happens. That fucker walks into the living room at 3:00 AM,he knows everyone is asleep,he can obviously see my body laying there and he walks to the edge of the bed. So he's standing there right next to the couch,right next to my head and he's gotta know I'm laying on top of a girl. We're trying hard to act like we're asleep and maybe I just happened to roll on top of her. It's working,he think's we're asleep and...he's leaving. Oh no he comes back and crouches next to my head. I can feel him looking at me. He crouches there for what seems like forever but is probably only 2 or 3 minutes and then leaves. What a tit.
Friend's brother stares at me while I'm sexing some broad up.
The Mojang account will soon be used to login to every game Mojang publishes, and Minecraft is one of them. When you make a Mojang account using a Minecraft account, the Minecraft account will automatically get migrated to the Mojang account. It will only change how you login to Minecraft and other games.
No worries, just use Mojang account info when logging into Mojang games.
As someone whose parents have been dealing with an insurance claim gone bad (more damage was done from the contractors taking our items then the actual claim) the way Judge Judy was rude and condescending to this recent vet was uncalled for. He barely got to present his side without being interrupted and was constantly insulted. Although in the end he said he was going to take the defendant to court (which is why that smiling a-hole most likely threw the stuff out on the curb) he probably thought his items would be released to him after some sort of settlement. 
He also shouldn't have to pay for the next month's rent when a hurricane flooded the apartment, the only reason he took his stuff out of there was so it wouldn't get more damage. The defendant is a total slumlord. 90% of the time it bothers me when "vet" is in the headline for some injustice but the rudeness here really struck a chord with me and I felt it was worth mentioning.
TL/DR-Judge Judy completely mishandled this case and was extremely rude and condescending to someone who just got back from Iraq.

I was hoping someone would ask this. There was a test, and it was one of the most nerve-racking times of my life. During the test, the sensei will have you do everything that you have learned since you got your red belt(the rank below black belt). He directs you through all of your forms(rhythmic patterns of techniques done in a sequence, sort of like how a dance is choreographed), all of your self defense moves(hand-to-hand techniques, breakaways, takedowns), all matwork(which is mostly takedowns that involve a mat for landing because of how rough the technique is...the mat is more of a safety precaution), and kicking(I cannot stress to you enough how much my sensei made me do every kick that I have learned repeatedly.) Finally, a candidate has to do some mock fighting or sparring as it is most commonly known. I geared up with a helmet, foot pads, and hand pads and had to fight a few people who wore the same thing. Then there was multi-sparring in which a candidate has to fight 7 people simultaneously. Then you would receive your belt at the end of the ceremony.
In order to get your next degree you have to do all the moves you learned since earning your first degree and you have to fight one more person in multi-sparring.
*** Each ceremony you have to execute the moves you have learned, and spar people.

After rereading what you quoted I see what you were referring too, I just get annoyed when people pounce on genres. 
My bad, carry on.
The worst part about TF2 was by far all the newfag gamers who actually thought they were good players because they could get a high score playing as a spy.
dear kid, you got a high score as spy because:
1) 99% of teams are mentally handicapped, and nobody would volunteer to be anti-spy.  and even if they did play anti-spy, they sucked at it because they were some fag kid who was playing TF2 for the hats and had no real skill.
2) spies became unbalanced pieces of shit once they added the new items.  as a spy, I can keep engineers down 24/7 with one hand tied behind my back, blind folded, and the other arm chopped off.
3) tf2 went full retard, and then went free to play.  hence the reason all the intelligent people left.  F2P environment = shit on a stick.
 spies are easy, TF2 sucks, the entire internet is mostly a piece of shit these days.
I mean, I check this subreddit every few hours at work, and its generally the same few posts it was last time, with a couple of new ones.  Getting rid of the "noob" posts doesn't mean that there will be more "Pro" posts, you'll still see the same ones you saw a few hours ago, and a few hours before that.
nobody is stopping you from either making it yourself, or posting your own reviews as it doesn't seem many others are often enough
Funny story about that:
Last year, I made beets for my roommate at that time and me. Later on, we went to the local bar to have a few brews. At some point he has to go to the bathroom, comes back 2 minutes later looking totally freaked out. He proclaimed that he had to leave right away and went home. I didn't make much of it at that point. The next day he says he went to the hospital. I was astonished, of course and asked him why. He said that he peed red in the pub and was afraid to have "penis cancer" or something (his chose of words). It took me two seconds to understand the connection and then started laughing like a maniac. He was very relived. 
 Roommate and I ate beets, he peed red from them and assumed he had penis cancer. 
No, I understand. Hitler thought he was doing good, but he wasn't. Yeah, I get it. But that's a bullshit argument. *REAL* morality is **NOT** subjective.
If I think raping women and killing puppies is good, it doesn't mean that it is. No matter how much **I** think it's good, it never will be. It doesn't matter what Christians *believe* to be good or bad, that fact is some things are bad NO MATTER WHAT. There is no "subjective morality" when it comes to raping little boys, torturing people because of what name they call their god or feeding someone hot coals and boiling water because you think they have demons inside them. YOU can think it's good all you want, and I and can think it's bad all I want, but at the end of the day it's bad because it is bad, not because I *feel* that it is bad.
So no, I am not confusing MY morality with that of others. YOU are confused that the idea of absolute morality can be subjective. It cant be. Charles Manson can think starting a race-war is just fine and dandy all he wants, and I can disagree with that view all I want but at the end of the day IT IS WRONG. Not becuase *I* think it's wrong but because IT FUCKING IS WRONG. Thinking something is ok when it isn't doesn't make it ok. So Christians *think* they are making the world a better place, but they arent. Absolutely regardless of what I or anyone else thinks. Some things are immoral no matter what ANYONE's opinion is. Period 
So yes, christians might think in their minds what they are doing/wanting is moral, but they are wrong. That's not a valid excuse. 
"Christians want the world to be a "better" place. The issue is that their conception of "better" is different from yours."
No, it's not that their conception of better is different from mine: IT'S DIFFERENT FROM FACT. It has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with opinion of preconceptions of me or anyone else. 
 I don't give ten thousand fucks what someone who is doing evil *thinks* about what they are doing. If it's evil, it's evil. Opinion has fuck all to do with it.
I find it ironic that you advocate longevity for quality content but still felt the need to add a " for a 3 sentence statement.
Ahem. It's my turn.
When my then fiancee and I decided to upgrade from a shitty basement apartment (owned by a delightful landlord) to a larger and more average apartment *with a fireplace*, we thought that University Park apartments were a good blend of size, configuration, and affordability. We chose not to listen to our friends who also lived there and told horror stories of what should have been rare events. My tale is the following.
On the first night we moved in, perhaps in the late fall, there was a modest thunderstorm. We awoke to a gigantic splashcrash that one could have made by throwing a 5gal. bucket into the bathtub or at least that's where I would have thrown it. A full sheet (4x8) of sheetrock had fallen from the ceiling in the bedroom in which we were not staying and dumped wallboard fragments, water, and insulation all over the floor. Luckily, all of our computer equipment was on the opposite wall. The (cosmetic) repairs to this were swift but ugly. 
Fast forward to Christmas time of the same year when my now wife and I came home from visiting the In-Laws. Now imagine returning from a cliche in-law relationship and wanting to just die in bed. Instead we were greeted by the sound of water dripping onto our dresser and the associated pile of bedroom things. The sheetrock was hanging off two or three screws and resting on our dresser. To say the least, the roof was not fixed.
We played a bit of hardball with the management at this time and were offered a different but mostly identical apartment. We naively thought that it couldn't be much worse, right? One evening after work, we decided to visit this new apartment to just to check it out before we moved in. Upon opening the door, you were greeted by the scent of rotting fish, the walls were horribly marred, the balcony was falling apart, etc. After careful contemplation, we decided not to take the apartment and figure something else out. Well, apparently we said this out loud and the apartment heard us because we couldn't get back out. The doorknob was broken from the inside. Neither of us had our phones. I heroically scaled the balcony and found a ladder across the complex to rescue the damsel in distress. 
We ended up accepting that apartment after a number of repairs and a significant rent reduction. I like my house now.
**- Hahahahahaha NO**
The reason the US recently put out that anti-co sleep campaign is because overweight people were killing their babies; I don't have the original source but it was legit, I'm sure you can google it.
If you're fat don't co-sleep.
Having a *baby* isn't that expensive, especially if you shop at bulk stores and use coupons.  Diapers, formula, baby wipes, baby food.  Clothes and blankets etc you'll get from a baby shower (have one even if you don't want to, and register somewhere for gifts. the amount of stuff you get is a HUGE money save).  Pro tip: don't just register for things for a newborn.  Register for clothes for a 6 mo old, a year old.  Register for expensive toys your older family members can afford (things like e-learners and the like).  Register for SAVINGS BONDS for their college.  Have a WIDE range of age-based items and prices.
Having a *toddler* is a littler more expensive.  Diapers, clothes because they're bigger now, baby proofing stuff for your house, etc.
Having a small child is even more expensive, and then even more so when they're pre-teen, more so again when they're teenagers, etc.  Teenagers are the most expensive.
** Babies are not expensive.  The older they get, the more money you will spend.**
Note: Do not wait until you're "financially stable" to have kids, because then you will never have them.  You will figure it out, and you will do what needs to be done for your children.
I think this answer depends on what grocery stores you frequent and where you are located. I'm located in California and for fresh groceries I shop at Sprouts Farmers Market. It's much cheaper and more fresh than stores like Ralphs or Albertsons. I only shop on Wednesdays there because they offer double ads that day. That is where I mainly save on produce. When they offer good sales on meat I stock up about 3 or 4 packages and freeze them. 
In terms of couponing I use blogs that do most of the work for me, like organicdeals.com. You can also check your brands website to see if they offer coupons. You said that you buy frozen vegetables? Cascadian Farms offers printable coupons. Stonyfield offers coupons on their website for dairy products, Organic Valley offers coupons, etc. Even fresh produce companies offer coupons, like Organic Girl and Earthbound Farms. Organic meat companies like Rosies Chicken offer coupons on their website/facebook too. 
TL:DR; Buy fresh produce and meats during store sales and coupon on Dairy, Frozen, Egg, and Dry (pasta, rice..),  products.  
I am in a similar circumstance, and I had a hard time consoling my identity with my actions.  
Background:  I am a cisgender lesbian who hasn't ever had a relationship and had had only a few (always negative) sexual experiences, exclusively with women.  I am very shy, and not really myself, around women, and so I find myself very lonely.  Having an understanding male friend who wanted to sleep with me, I finally got interested enough one drunken night to try it.  I've been "trying it" for months now.  I like the sex enough, but I'm totally not attracted to men or him.  At first, I was thinking I might be bisexual.  But, when it comes to thinking about personalities or bodies, only women turn me on.  However, the act itself can get me pretty excited, no matter what the sex.  Now, I'm at the point were I recognize that my sexuality and my sex drive have different motives.  I can accept that now, and I'm cool with it.
** Lesbian that has sex with guy and enjoys it while retaining her sexual identity.**
Sorry this is a long story.
My gf and I used to throw parties at our apartment when we lived together about half a year ago. At one party my best friend brings over his girlfriend. Lets call her "Stacy." This girl was known to be "that bitch" at parties. By that, I mean shes the one that strips down to her underwear and walks around, or is constantly trying to outdrink people, or just trying to be all "LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"....
At this party, my gf, my best friend's 2 sisters, Stacy and I are smoking a bowl from my gf's pipe. We're on our 2nd bowl and everyone is feeling  pretty good. The pipe gets to Stacy, she takes a big hit, passes it to the left, exhales, then begins to talk. She says, and this is verbatim, word for word... "I have this huge collection of pipes and stuff that I've collected, hidden at home. Whenever I am at parties and stuff, people ask me to hold their pipe for them because they're done smoking, but want me to keep smoking and enjoy myself. Later, when they come back and ask for it back, I tell them that they never gave it to me and that they must have been wicked high. Then I just keep it for myself."
Needless to say.... it killed everyone's high. And we watched her every move for the rest of the night.
**- Bitch at my party admits she steals other people's pipes when she goes to parties.**
I never liked her, even before this incident.
At a party in the past, my best friend decided to bring "Stacy" over. His 2 sisters came along also. My best friend, Stacy, his 2 sisters, and a couple other people decided they wanted to do tabs that night. So my best friend and Stacy go out on a run to the dealer with everyone's money to make the deal. When they got back, Stacy said she accidentally dropped all of one the sister's tabs when she left the dealer and searched everywhere for it.
Turns out the bitch took her tabs and decided to lie about it..... we all knew she did it........ shit got real that night
oh, and sorry if my narrative-like comments are hard to understand.
**TL:DR- Same bitch stole her bf's sister's drugs and tried to say the "dropped them and couldn't find them." But we knew.... we all knew &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;**
You won't believe the shit this kid pulled a year ago.  
My friend and this kid he knew (a Black hipster idiot) walked over to my house and asked if I would smoke them out. I told them I was just about to leave for Pasadena and didn't have time. It's July so it's about 110 degrees so I offer them a ride home. So the hipster kid lies down in the back. I also stash my weed in a canister back there. While I was driving him home, the black kid stole my $30 bag of weed. Biggest scumbag I ever met.    
  
 Don't trust black hipsters
I own this T-Shirt. I love [shirt.woot](www.shirt.woot.com). It's a cool concept they have a new shirt every day for $12.00 free shipping (Can upgrade shipping for 5 if you must have it right then) They hold a derby every week where users submit drawings based on a topic and the top 3 voted at the end of the week get made into shirts! This is one of those derby shirts. Definitely worth the checkout.
*** this is a shirt from [Shirt.Woot](www.shirt.woot.com) really cool site, check it out   
**EDIT:** sorry for the stupid links RES is fucking up and I'm too busy at work to fix the problem now.
&gt;Their sex drives really could be incompatible, but this isn't a relationship with a serious sex drought.
Sex drive is kind of like car driving, in this sense.  It's not that 20 mph is *always* dangerously slow, or that 120 mph is *always* dangerously high.  Context is important, and most speed-related accidents are caused by people driving at vastly different rates.  
The only thing that really matters is that everyone on the road is going in the same direction, at about the same speed.
**TLDR**:  If you like fucking at 120 mph, don't fuck someone who's comfortable in the slow lane.  Someone is going to get hurt.
Girl, tonight we're gonna make love. You know how I know that? Because it's Wednesday, and Wednesday is the night that we usually make love...
 It's business time.
Yeah, I'm sick of people acting like they would not have sex with her. She may not be most most cunning conversationalist, but she has one thing that makes her irresistible to a lonely male human. Well, make that two things. Catch my drift?
**- Boobs.**
He awoke in a daze, madly frustrated and aching for redemption. All these years lead to old age, and as he sat still in his musky bedroom he realized it was already 3 in the afternoon. He had been decaying each day under a cloud of cigarette smoke. This unfolded the same way for the last 4 years. 
Atrophy should have corrupted him by now. 
He got up, checking the mirror to see what his reflection had in store for him. He felt like they were different, he and his reflection. He looks down, juggling at his pair, and looks up. He doesn't see them in the mirror. 
He doesn't see himself. 
So the confusion sets in worse than before, or maybe just the same. He slicks back what little hair he has left from a basin of water that rests atop his radiator. The old heater looked as much a relic as he did, and the water hadn't been changed since the last time he changed his bed sheets. 
Both were browning in age. 
So the brown water keeps the strands clinging to his scalp, and he slips this old wig over the mess. Under the wig he feels a burden lifting. Why hadn't he done this sooner? 
10 minutes pass and now he's back at the mirror. The reflection looks great, and as he looks down at himself he knows why. They match. They actually match. 
He felt something that day, as he stepped into the sunshine. He felt complete. Natural. For the first time in all his years, his burden was a whisper in the past. He checked his reflection as he passed his beaten down Chevrolet. What a wonderful sun dress. 
On the way to the strip he stops. He grabs a baby stroller at the local thrift shop, and fills it with cheap dolls from the aisle over. This is good. 
As he makes his way down the road he makes a point to shake it. He forces a wiggle. He's moving as smoothly as he can, though he and the stroller are in less than perfect condition. No matter, because that essence he is aiming for all comes down to attitude. 
The more windows he passes, the more he looks and the more he is becoming a she. That pretty blue sundress, those perfect children all well behaved. They're jammed into the stroller and all perfectly behaved. Jammed in tight, like the way he jammed his manhood back between his legs. 
People are stopping and staring, some taking pictures, others laughing. She lights a cigarette and keeps on keeping on. It's been 10 windows now, and each window was like a lifetime. A year in a woman's shoes. She's fully converted now. 
She lights a cigarette. 
At this point, there's nothing you can do to break the old mans gait. He has become a she. On this day, he lost the last strands of his mental stability. He caved in and gave himself to his darkest secrets. 
And he knows he is beautiful. 
Even as I write this, she's converting things in full swing. Lopping off dead weight and creating crevices and cavities where she pleases. She's not sane, but she's beautiful, and she's closer to a woman now than ever before. She has her children, and they're a family. They're doing all right. 
You can see them most ever day as they make their rounds, strutting like death as they barge through the town. A family by definition, and a sight to be seen. The old woman and her babies, they beg to be freed. 
- short origin story. 
Ok, so a few weeks ago I was going to get on a train. there was a woman struggling to get onto a train, had a zimmerframe and everything; everyone was walking away from her though, I thought it was strange for so many people to just leave this woman stranded rather than helping her get on.
I went up, and said, "how would you like me to help you, should i grab the front of the frame and pull it up onto the train as you get on?"
She nodded and I got on the train, bent down to pick up the zimmerframe and i look into the basket at the front.

"What. the. fuck."
It was FULL of barbies with the heads ripped off and baby dolls without any clothes on. I look up to the woman i'm helping on and it's an old guy, with a wig and a dress on.
After i helped him on, he asked if I wanted to buy anything in the basket.
"No thanks"
- there are a lot of these people out doing the same shit as this guy.
I feel like this isn't a fair representation of how we measure arc length or circumfrence. While true, this is actually how it's done, using techniques like integrals, the process can be very simplified. For instance, if you have a vector that traces an arc, then you derive that vector, normalize it, then integrate it, you get the arc length. While that is basically taking very small straight lines, it's an easier way of doing it. It's an automated process that is like manually creating an estimation with a huge number of straight edges.
 math is like writing programs for this kind of stuff, so you don't have draw shapes with billions of sides.
We've got a lot in common. I used to have friends I felt I could trust with anything, but eventually reality hit home and I realised that no matter how tight knit a group of friends we were, their own interests would always come before our friendship.
3 years later and all that's happened is I've proven myself right. Everybody's gone. They've all split away to pursue their own lives and I've been left behind. I've changed a lot since my big epiphany, arguably I'm a lot more miserable than I was then, but I'm fine on my own when it comes down to it. I have a direction in life, and I'm going to follow that ambition and see where it leads me. I wont let the people I know define my life, I'll make my own choices instead.
When it comes down to it, friends and companionship really is just a pleasant distraction. In the grand scheme of things, a companion will never last forever. Even if they are loyal enough to stick with you, eventually they'll die, leaving you on your own again.
Always remember that the pursuit of friendship is just a means to fight off your own loneliness. It serves no other real purpose.
 We've got a bit in common.
My best accidental 911 call had to be one I didn't actually commit:
I was a kid of about 9, and this was in the very early '90s when suddenly every house had cordless phones. I was a pretty responsible kid, so I was allowed to stay at home alone during the day (I honestly can't remember if this was the weekend or if I just stayed home from school that day). I was putzing around happy as a clam until the phone abruptly started ringing. Now, I was trained from a young age to not pick up the phone while I was home alone in case the caller on the end-- apparently a criminal possessed of psychic powers --deduced that I was home alone. So, I naturally let the answering machine do its job:
*"Hello? This is the police department. We received a call from this residence and we're sending a squad car over right now."*
For no damned good reason, I was immediately filled with a guilty conscience and panicked. I ran upstairs to my room and hid in my closet in preparation for cops to come bursting in. To this day, I don't know why my knee-jerk reaction was to fear cops, but I did. Luckily, my parents managed to get home just as the cops showed up and the situation was quickly cleared up.
Apparently, several brands of cordless phones back then had a knack of calling 911 when their batteries died. It was routine enough that the cops just laughed it off and left without incident.
**** '90s-era cordless phone called 911 for its own life, I spent the afternoon in my bedroom closet like a panicked fugitive.
This probably isn't the most exciting, but it was my closest.
 I was hungry, so I biked 5 miles to a McDonalds, called my friend from a payphone to see if he wanted anything while I was there. 
He lives in the next town, which is across a highway, I should note that it's 1 in the morning, pitchblack, and I'm biking down a fucking highway with semi's zooming past me at 100km/h blaring their horns, and at one in the morning people are tired, maybe dozing off, you never know right? I seriously thought I was going to die, the exit for his town was about 20 minutes at bike speed. 
Every time I'd see a car coming past I would get off my bike and walk into the grass as much as I could so I wouldn't get hit, at one point when I was shoved off into the grass I heard something in the forest and almost shit myself, probably a dear or something but it could have been a crazy naked pedophile axe murderer that escaped from jail, you just never know. Then when the car would pass, I'd get on my bike and fucking truck it down the road until I saw more headlights.
In the end, he got his cold burgers and I got my cold burgers. On the way back I took the longway. Never. Again.
***: Had the munchies, biked down a highway to get to the McDicks.
I just bought the 1.8 as the first upgrade to the kit zoom that came with my T1i.  It is an amazing little lens, just devours any available light.  I haven't noticed much aberration when stopped down to 1.8 (1.4 would require the ... 1.4 lens, which is 4x the price).  On the other hand, I don't really look that closely - I get a lot more enjoyment out of shooting than post-processing, so a lot of my shots don't get a second look.
 best $100 I ever spent.
I wouldn't really consider save states cheating. Firstly, they aren't considered cheating when SA has a large game wide challenge for older games and secondly because it doesn't really eliminate the challenge of the game. The only thing it gets rid of is the tedious workings of the save system. I'm playing through the original MM and originally was against save states but, it did start to get tedious. Started using them and it increased the fun factor by ten at least. I did this with the original LoZ and it also removed any sense of tedious gameplay.
You just have to set a good balance in how often you do it, really. Too much and you probably are actually cutting out part of the game experience the developers intended the player to have but, too little and you're pounding your head on the wall.
Sure, purists might say I didn't get a true Megaman experience because of it but, in the end it's a video game so fun is more important than everything else.
just use save states and if you aren't having fun even if you do, then stop but, don't let yourself not enjoy really great games because of predefined rules on what's the "right" way to play a game.
Norway here, and this is what I think:
I am in shock, a shock that gets more severe every day I watch the news about politics in the US. I cannot in any conceivably way, understand how your people actually are letting this nonsense go on. How did your country, that was based on (in its time at least) such radical and great ideas, go so terrible wrong. USA has the only constitution that I know of that clearly states that religion and politics are not to mixed, and yet you have the most religious afflicted politics in the western world.  
You know what? My history, politics and society teachers actually laughs, and make fun of you guys when I bring up the current situation in USA. Well some of them are also concerned ofc, but they just shakes their heads in disgust. 
Stop making fools of your self. Please. For your own good.

Like others have mentioned, growing up in America means soccer takes a back seat to other sports like NFL, basketball, and Baseball. I was one of those kids who played soccer until 12 and just quit because I was more interested in traditional American sports like Baseball and especially Basketball because I was always one of the taller kids (6'5 as of now).
I've always considered myself one of the most knowledgeable about sports among my friends because everyday I was reading articles, watching highlights or games on tv. Well my Senior year of high school is when I started noticing soccer a bit. I made some friends who played soccer and watched it religiously. So I started to play pick up games with them, even though I wasn't good (still not) and was just the dorky tall token gringo with all the Mexican kids. 
 
I've always been patriotic when the US national team plays regardless of the sport. So when the 2010 WC came around, I bled Red White and Blue. I'm certain that I'm not the only American here that can thank Landon Donovan with his [late game heroics.]( I was hooked after that. I went out and bought the Fifa 2010 WC game and played it non stop with my friends and online until I finally won it all.
Well the WC had passed, I was going away to college, and I thought I was coming down off my soccer fever. Well, luck be it, my half my hall were soccer fanatics. Mostly Barcelona (yuck!) fans. Well, I've always liked going against the grain (LA dodger and Laker fan living in San Diego), so I knew I had to pick a different team. Well my friends who I played pick up with back home were Man U and Chelsea fans. 
And let me tell you this, I was DEAD CLOSE TO BECOMING A RED DEVIL! Scary right? I however, didn't want to be a front runner and decided to get fifa 11 for my PS3 and see what team I liked playing with. Well... I liked chelsea a lot, also Real Madrid because of how awesome CR7 was in that game, but my favorite team was Arsenal by far. They passed the ball beautifully and just had a great flow to them. I talked to my friends back home and they said Arsenal was their favorite team to watch aside from "Their team" because they had just a beautiful offense. So midway through the season I started waking up to catch Arsenal on some live streams. 
And let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Arsenal was just damn exciting. RVP, Fabregas, and Wilshere just were phenomenal. I hadn't seen football  played that pretty ever. What put me over the edge though was the Champions league game 1 vs Barcelona. From that day on, I knew I was a Gooner for life. 
Ever since then, I've been waking up at 5 AM to watch our Gooners play live. I have never regretted choosing this team, and as the more I learn about the club, its history, its players, and just the way they run things, I can say that I'm proud I fell in love with an organization that does things the right way, The Arsenal Way. 
** Friends and WC 2010 got me interested in soccer, Almost became Man U fan,  Fifa WC/2011 helped me choose Arsenal to follow, and CL game 1 vs. Barcelona  cemented my love for Arsenal and being a Gunner for life.**
I seriously dont know, i wasnt really a football fan as a kid. But all of my friends were and they were all babling about Henry, Bergkamp etc and i had no idea what they were really talking about. So bought Fifa 05 and played it to get a better insight on football, players etc. Since then always sympathised with Arsenal but didnt really follow their games. Then when all these football streams started around the web, i first followed Lazio because of my national hero Goran Pandev :D. Whelp, came back to my sympathy Arsenal and havent really missed a game since the 09/10 season.
edit: Funny how football games are involved in this :D
*** It just happend :P
So far, the closest right answer has been downvoted. It is in fact a matter of sovereignty. UN attempts are not vetoed on a whim, but because this isn't a matter of international law. The nature of rebel forces in Syria makes it more a case of civil war and a failed state. *Technically*, it isn't their place to intervene, they cannot be given a blessing to engage.
Are there foreign influences? Yes. Are Syrians fleeing as refugees to other countries? Yes. Why hasn't the international community decided to make the case that it can now count as an external conflict that means other countries can (and should) intervene? Because the countries who would win the case, and be responsible for intervening, are countries that aren't in the position to engage in conflict right now. The US would have to compel its population that it's a moral crusade but their tactics would end up more like our interference in the Baltic states, where our methods were more than slightly questionable. All of the stronger countries in the EU are focused on stabilizing their economy and if any conflict starts there, it's going to be an offensive strike to demand oil from Russia (which won't be internationally supported since Russia is hurting for its own oil) on behalf of the smaller countries that are suffering deaths through the winter.
Syria's falling apart at a bad time.
She is suggesting that the private institute of Georgetown College, again a Private Catholic school, add contraception to the health coverage plan they voluntarily offer for students. It is against their beliefs to offer contraception. Noone is blocking her from getting contraception, none is stopping her from having sex as much as she wants. The school is simply saying they are not going to provide her, or anyone, free contraception as part of their coverage. She also suggested that during her time there she would need two to three thousand dollars of coverage during her time at the school. This is an incredible amount of coverage.
I have dated women who shopped around and selected their health insurance plan based largely on their coverage of birth control pills. Considering the $36,000+ tuition Fluke paid to attend the college, she could easily have done the same. 
*** This is not about a person being denied, in any way, access to contraception. It is about a person attempting to force a private organization to act against their belief system for her personal gain.***
Also, Shiftless Rent-a-cooch from East Whoreville is an excellent put-down. It is well crafted, brutal, unnecessarily vulgar, and borderline-abusive. 5 out of 5 stars. Would degrade again.
I would seriously doubt you would make the team, the players are ridiculous and it is because they have all probably played at a high level their entire life and in high school.  
  However, I know that Soccer is a club team, so that may mean that you can still participate in someway.  So, if you are at all interested, contact them and see what you need to do.
  To put it in perspective, I tried to walk-on the tennis team my freshman year.  I played tennis my whole life and played at a very competitive high level on my high school team as well as year round, high-level tournament play.  I contacted the coach and he basically said, "show up at the time and day with your rackets and ready to play and we'll see."  So, I did.  And so did about 60 other people.  The coach then told us that he doesn't have time to evaluate us all so we will all play a tournament, to completion that day and MAYBE he will take one of us.  And he immediately put us in a bracket, left it with an intern, and away we went.  I sailed through pretty easy until the semi finals.  That match, I barely won, like 6-4, 6-3.  Then I played the finals and got absolutely rocked, 6-0, 6-1.  The coach took the kid who beat me.
  **TL,DR; No, no way in hell will you make the team**
I can't answer for everyone, obviously, although as people have pointed out, the media and fashion industry play a large role in this. 
For me, it was because of my parents' remarks when I was a child and teenager--my mom making digs at me for not being as slim as she was when she was my age, and my dad constantly grabbing and pinching me anywhere he could get hold of any fat. I distinctly remember him telling me on at least one occasion that no one would ever want to marry me if I stayed as fat as I was. The thing is, I know now that I was never overweight then. Slightly chubby as a kid, yeah, but only slightly.
The thing is, I find curvier girls more attractive, and (now) think I look better that way as well, but I also like to work out a few times a week because it makes me feel better overall, which makes me on the skinnier side because of how I'm built. 
 In general, media and fashion; for me personally, parents were assholes
No other skills? Translation, that's about it.  Translation also rarely pays the bills these days.
If you really want to get "use" out of your Mandarin either go back and get an MA or MBA in something useful or, if you're American, study hard for the Foreign Service Exam since Chinese nets you some points/extra pay should you get in.  You could also try applying for the NSA or CIA since Mandarin is a boon for those guys, but those jobs generally take about a year+ to start if you should even get hired.  Having an MA would also make all of these easier.
I wouldn't waste your time on studying exclusively for the HSK unless you want a goal or something.  It's pretty useless unless you're looking to go to school in China.  I don't know anyone who has a heavily Mandarin-using  job in China that needed to take it.  If you can pass level 6 on the new test it would be a nice thing to throw around, but anything lower than that would be sort of useless with all the 100% fluent finance MA holders running around China.
A last thing to really solidify myself as Mr. Pessimism, but what do you mean by "sometimes a little choppy"?  I have friends who have jobs in Finance or Marketing within China, and they did things like write their Master's Thesis entirely in Chinese.  That's the level of Chinese you'll be competing against before the experience or graduate degrees factor into things.
A degree in east asian studies and passable Chinese is not enough to get a "Real" job in China without significant 关系.  Get an MA or something if you're serious.
First off, all you have to do is eat the one cigarette. You will puke guaranteed.
Second off, fuck your friends if they take offense to you smoking. Stop giving a shit what they think about your actions. Are you hurting them? Didn't think so, so stop letting them think they have any room to comment.
Finally, stop smoking. I smoke. Shit's bad for you. Quit now before you're too entrenched in the habit.
=======================
*** Smoke whenever you want, but you're best off just never smoking, and your friends are judgmental assholes.
Wait, I ask you to merely give an explanation and supply some food-for-thought to help you understand what I am asking, and you dodge the chance to explain your position?  This is so ridiculous that I question whether you posted your earlier comment with any amount of seriousness.
I ask for your opinion on something, and you refuse for technical reasons.  My troll-radar is blaring.
GeezusKraist that was a hell of a good read. It made my day. I'm very happy for you.  
The ending stroke a cord with me:
&gt;Looking back I was able to see just how easy it is to make a clique and be influenced by it without even realizing it. [...] Getting out from under my best friends hands I was able to really figure myself out.  
I arrived to the same conclusion sometime ago... Background story:  
The first group of friends that I hold dear to my heart are the ones that I was open from the beginning at Freshman college year. After 2 weeks of hanging out, they noticed that maybe I wasn't kidding about my comments on such soccer player or actor. So my friend E. asked: "So, Deer I really don't care much, and I won't stop talking to you or anything like that but I do have to ask: Are you gay?" "I'm open to date boys, and girls. I'm figuring stuff out" 
And from then on, I became the token queer friend. I would get bitchy comments from my high school gay friend for being such a loser and hang out with a bunch straight guys/gals that wouldn't get me. My hs friend didn't "get me" that much either. But it was great to feel accepted for being me, just an odd nerd with a morbid sense of humor.
However, looking back I remember struggling to keep myself centered.  I felt pulled and pushed ever so slightly by my friends' expectations. Some waited for my "phase" to wear off and get a girlfriend, then there were the "How come you are not being gay enough?" and even some "Why can't other gays be like you Deer?" To which I replied, is not a phase, I can only be myself and others can do as they please.  When I realized that they were not helping me grow, I set boundaries that earned me my current nickname Uncle Hermit.  I stop attending their parties, where they would tried to score and I was just an spectator. Instead, I went solo to discover my favorite beers, bars, and clubs gay or not.  
In the last 3 years or so, from that clique, the youngest confessed the crush he had on me when we first met; 2 other friends came out as gay; 1 bi guy and 2 bi girls; the straight guys had a wtf-is-going-on reaction and I ended up in a position to call on everyone's bullshit.  Their hopes on me getting a girlfriend (some tried to hook me up with girls) was to prove they could do it too.  The ones that wanted me to act camp was so they could say we were different, and therefore not bicurious.
I wouldn't say they held me back, but I do feel like I let them slow me down. I'm 26 and even though I've being honest about my sexuality I haven't really "date" and I'm yet to experience all those fluffy feelings on love and stuff. I've only being in a slow paced journey I think. 
"A paso lento pero seguro."
I feel like some friends tried to held me back because they were insecure with themselves, so I can relate to that. 
Currently there are no limitations. The government wants to introduce a membership system for coffeeshops in 2013 but Amsterdam is against it and isn't planning on enforcing it. 
Don't worry about it now
You are a confused person arent you.
Yeah the WBC is abhorrent because of their homophobia. But your argument was that the NAACP is good now, because they were 100 years ago. Things can go from beneficial to detrimental. Thats the point. You really like to assume dont you? I know that there is still racism against black people. Where did i say their was only reverse racism? Oh, your making shit up again. you like to do that a lot. Im not saying they dont need advocacy. Im saying the NAACP is racist towards non-black people. Thats it. 
And again, where in the fuck did i say racism is over?
JACL had a specific reason to form, and their mission was simple. For the people who were fucked over during the war to get back what they lost. The NAACP pushes to promote black people over every other race. So yes racist.
You pulled me thinking racism is over out of your ass. NAACP is still racist. 
It's fairly common knowledge that the riaa uploads child porn disguised as .mp3s of top 40 songs as a deterrent for file sharing. There's nothing illegal about this. If you report it that means you were already breaking the law in the first place.

I have had the unfortunate experience of being involved in a potential domestic dispute between a daughter and her parents. The daughter (a sophomore in college) was desperate to leave her asian parents' home and flew to the other side of the US. When one of her parents traveled several hundred miles to track her down to retrieve the daughter, a policeman was present during the confrontation to protect the rights of the daughter against being compelled to return against her will. Had the officer not been present, I highly suspect my friend would've had her arm grabbed and physically compelled to return home amid lots of intimidating and intense emotional outbursts.
Without the police, people like my friend born into insular immigrant families would have no chance at becoming independent/self-reliant and choosing a lifestyle outside of what their parents force upon them (in her case, marrying early, having kids, cooking. cleaning, no career, no independence).
 Thanks to the US police, my friend was able to non-violently escape her asian family's control of her life.
&gt; Fortunately real psychologists know that there are a shitload of female offenders out there that simply haven't been reported or caught.
And yet they were kind enough to share their findings with you. How fortunate you are to be such a gatherer of "unreported" data.
 Peer-reviewed reports carry far more weight that both "everybody knows ..." and "a guy in the pub told me". 
He didn't say he's guilty. He simply said this might NOT be a case of the system over-reacting.
I once talked to the police to report some child porn I had discovered. I was hoping they might be able to identify the children shown. My computer wasn't confiscated and I wasn't prevented from being around children. While it is possible the guy in this story is innocent and simply dealt with an irrational reaction by the authorities, it is also possible the authorities have good reason to suspect otherwise.
TL;DR
A presumption of innocence does not preclude accepting the possibility of guilt.
This was a dumb decision for several reasons. Exaggerated example: if you robbed a bank, but then you found out they stuffed a bunch of CP in your money bag, would you bring it to the police and say "hey, somebody gave me all this CP without my knowledge while I was committing another crime, and I don't know who it came from." I don't think downloading is on the same level of bank robbery but you can't go to the cops with CP without them being suspicious of you, especially if you're admitting to another crime in the process. What does he expect them to do?
 This guy is dumb.
&gt;The long and short of it is that she's not mentally well.
I don't like inconclusive excuses like this. It's overused and more often than not, it's wrong. Passion isn't crazy. Fear isn't crazy. They're real human reactions to real human things. If the tables had been turned, if you came running into a room to see your wife holding your kid upside down by the leg while he howled you'd probably be like "WTF???" And while EVERYONE hopes that their response in all situations would be one of rational calm and absurd cleverness, it isn't. 
I'm really sad that things turned out the way they did. My brother went through something sickeningly similar with some stupid bitch he knocked up and married. She's not crazy, she's actually pretty high functioning for being...someone I wouldn't ever EVER EVER even talk to much less sex, but still. He doesn't see his daughters because of all the stupid that humans do when they've been hurt and keep hurting until the little things aren't enough and all of a sudden you're tearing each others' hearts apart with your teeth and grinding each others' souls into meat-paste. People are vindictive and cruel, but unfortunately that doesn't mean they're crazy. 
she's probably not crazy, just jumps to all the wrong conclusions and once the hurt game has been started she's too afraid of losing to realize she's already lost by playing. 
Congrats on your scholarship. I said "if" and winked, so I didn't actually make the assumption, I made a joke. I am, however, a White man, so it's silly to say I'm hateful against myself twice.
I did know that Fred Phelps was in the Civil Rights movement, but how does that indict the NAACP?? Phelps' church is abhorrent because of their stunty homophobia, not because they advocate for too much help for Black people - which they never, ever have.
Honestly, the assertion that the NAACP is racist - is racist. It's based on a fear that Blacks are getting more than they deserve. I understand a lot of Americans can think that without being terrible people - just ignorant. But look at what you're saying: the only racism that exists today is "reverse-racism". Black Americans don't need extra attention because racism against them is over. That's a stunning proposition!
I agree the NAACP should disband when racism against Blacks ceases. But I just cited incontrovertible evidence of anti-Black racism today. [Here's the MIT-Chicago study.]( What's *your* basis for saying racism is over?
Americans were polled on racism a hundred years ago too - and the overwhelming majority said there was no racism against Black people. Same exact thing in the Civil Rights era. I agree things are better now than in the past, but it seems that every generation of Americans thinks racism is over, and we can move on and make equal demands on everyone. They said it a decade after slavery was over. But it's simply not true.
Japanese Americans got reparations from the United States government, by the way, and they were represented by the [JACL]( which is still running today, and says that it's mission is "to protect the rights of all Asian Pacific Americans". By your definition, they're "fucking racist" too.
**Anti-Black racism still exists, therefore the NAACP is still valid.**
&gt; On the other hand beyond that it means little except inflating your sense of self worth and acting as a license to give opinion (as is the usual attitude among students or fresh graduates).
Degrees are simply entry permits to become slave labor. You can use them to get a foot in the door when you want a job.

&gt; Simply having a degree in medicine doesn't make you a doctor nor does it make anyone trust you to treat them. 
Try becoming a professor or head of surgery without  a  degree. Try buying a new rolls royce without any money. Try getting married while being homeless. 
Society judges people based on possessions. The more you have the more doors open for you.
Yes it's true that having the "decorations"  of this world doesn't make you a better person, but that's how society judges people. 
&gt; - Degrees mean jack. 
In absolute terms yes. They don't mean anything. But in human society they do. 
Would you also extend this to islamic degrees and ijazas? That they also don't mean jack? I am with you in that too :)
I like the idea of the question but I'm opposed to the attitude towards higher education you convey.
I believe in the utter necessity of degrees because that piece of paper saying you've done x amount of study in y field from an accredited institution is necessary. You will routinely see me demanding to know this or that alleged authority's academic qualifications for example. But that's due to the deplorable aspect of human nature by which we deceive each other.
On the other hand beyond that it means little except inflating your sense of self worth and acting as a license to give opinion (as is the usual attitude among students or fresh graduates).
Simply having a degree in medicine doesn't make you a doctor nor does it make anyone trust you to treat them. Your opinion might be taken but it won't challenge the opinion of an experienced person who can also be trusted for treating and managing a patient's care. The difference? The post-degree apprenticeship (internship, residency, etc). Though this is done very rigorously in medicine (lengthy licensing process for obvious reasons), this has a rough equivalent in every field. In the academic fields it generally refers to the number of useful works you've written/published and the reputation you earn therefrom. 
What use are fresh graduates' opinions? When they're not opinions... because they're easier to ask questions of than a reference work (changing due to the internet though the human can at least attempt to explain it in layperson's language).
- Degrees mean jack. They're like passports with no stamps in them. Simply having a passport doesn't make you well traveled. But you cannot leave the country or union without one. At most it means people can pester you with questions when they're too lazy to read through the textbooks of your field.
They aren't catering to "COD Players", they are catering to the people who play the game. A large portion (something like 50% if I remember correctly) play metro. Those aren't COD players, those are battlefield players who happen to like metro. Just because YOU don't like metro, doesn't mean other battlefield players have to hate it as well. 
If DICE or EA wants to do a close quarters pack, they'll do a close quarters pack. Complaining about how it's unfair or "not battlefield" won't do anything but cause petty negativity throughout the community.
Think about it from DICE's perspective. They spend their time and talents to work on a new project, further expanding battlefield 3 into territory they haven't explored yet. They attempt to take on rivaling series' and see try to please a large portion of their community. Then work hard on designing these maps, creating the destruction, testing and testing, and when it finally gets released, all they hear is "Y U NO CATER TO BATTLEFIELD PLAYERZ?!". It may not be TRADITIONAL battlefield, but it's still battlefield. Battlefield is about innovation, yet BF2 players demand to get the same game released. They are trying something the other AAA fps do not try, incorporating CQB with destructible environment. 
I for one am excited to see how this will turn out. I will look to future updates about the expansion to see if I want to give it a try. if I like what I see, I may go gather some money from ponds in order to pay for this expansion. If not, oh well, I get to keep my money, I still play the same game, and people who like small game modes like this are happy and have a place to go.
Battlefield is about innovation, not "doing what BF2 did", and if mixing CQB with destruction is the next experimental step forward, so be it. 
It's more down to a difference in playing styles. He's an aerially dominant forward with an ok ability to hold the ball, where Arsenal are a team that play it along the floor and like to pass into a forward's feet. He began his career well because he was the only striker used during preseason and some of the early games, so the team got used to his strengths. Combine that with an on fire Nasri, Wilshere emerging into the team, and Cesc Fabregas, and you get a situation where everyone wins. 
However, when RVP got back to fitness after the world cup and a few injuries, he took over and the team adapted to his play style of finding a ball to cut though defense that he can win and score with. IIRC, Van Persie was fairly ineffective in his first few games back because the team was used to Chamakh and people were calling for a 4-4-2 with Robin playing in the Bergkamp role. 
I wouldn't call him a failure by any rate. We got him for free, he scored 15ish goals in his first season, and has strengths that don't get utilized. On top of the fact that there isn't a striker in the world right now that would knock RVP out of his place.
** Different play style to  the rest of the team, scored 15 goals on a free transfer, RVP.**
I have eaten spiders to freak out spider-haters.  I don't understand the hate.  Spiders eat other bugs.  I admire them.  Please, love them.  I don't want to martyr another spider.

Just so you all know. If you want to donate your organs or tissues, MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR LOVED ONES. I worked in the Organ and Tissue donation line of work for 4 years. I can't tell you how many people DON'T get to donate because their family says no DESPITE the person being a registered donor. Pretty much works like this. The companies have legal rights to recover from a registered donor, however, due to the sensitivity of the subject, when a loved one dies, its the family that we have to work with and we don't want to make enemies. They often don't know the wishes of their lost one and don't want anything done to the body that they think will defile or ruin it. So make sure you clearly tell everyone what it is that you want done with your body when you die. 
If you don't tell you family what you want done with your body, it may not happen.

not slow and painful. just fun
&gt; But few people raid, percentage wise, in WoW
Where are you people getting this? The majority of people at top level raid and the people not at top level aren't even people.
&gt; pain in the ass the rest of the time. Getting that many players together at the same time
you have bad and tardy friends if this was the case with you
&gt; so why spend more on players that are not paying anything anymore
so you're telling  me they shouldnt care about their active players?
&gt; Gear that does so much that you are literally 1% of your former self without it
you're correct on this point. but anet has fixed it by giving out stock gear. all they need to do is make the mechanics of the fight new and trickier.
Laslty. I'm on your side. I love guild wars 2. I am SO stoked for it's pvp endgame, especially WvW. The concept of me and my 10 or so friends owning a piece of the server, (probably a tower) and helping our server trounce another is exhilarating. But i ask, why can't ANet throw some devs at endgame raiding that is focused on fight mechanics?
pertaining to that last sentence. They could add these sort of challenges to major cities that people could watch a group do in an arena. A stock boss that has crazy mechanics and stuff. It doesn't have to be "go into the castle of doom to fight the evil lizard lord." My kind of gamer is looking for man vs. computer. Basically good reflexes.
GW2 challenges pvp players and provides, but is lacking interesting end game pve, barring explorable modes which are really just heroics
BOOOOO!!!! this shit is inflammatory. I don't really care how this is rationalized, or what people think about it. You are allowed to have your opinion, just like Dr. Watson, and you might even have "facts" to back it up. Posting this shit to reddit however, is just a weird way to express thinly veiled racism and to give yourself (if you are not black) a little superiority boost.
Sure, OP might have been posting this from a "O my god the discoverer of DNA is sooooo Crazy!!!!! LOlollolzozozlzo!!!!" but I doubt it. Posting this is just plain racist, and the OP should know better.  
**Fuck you rydmcalboy (OP)**
BAM! I totally agreed with OP's logic until I read your comment. Not that I don't think there are other variables to consider in each point, but I will be damned if this community doesn't force me to actually challenge my own thoughts every now and again.
 Reddit makes me feel like [this](
I take it you found the whole exchange pointless then? I think the stranger learned something from the exchange. I offered him constructive criticism on his approach to messaging women in the future. I took the time to respond to his message, which was what he was really looking for. He rather that I insult him than ignore him. That statement right there speaks volumes of the frustration this man has had on this site.

Cats will let you know when they are annoyed. She was probably giggling as it was giving her warnings but she just laughed at the cute noises it was making. Then the cat followed through with its warnings.

This happened to my sister once, but it was her fault. She was holding our eldest cat Max (5 at the time) next to our cage of birds. She thought this was a good idea.... bird freaks out, cat tries to break free, and claws my sisters face. Had to take her to the hospital, where cops questioned my dad for child abuse. But, i loved that cat. And she was fine.

Today it's this thread.
Yesterday was "just dropping this here" with 7 replies.
Day before was "my flair"
Day before that was "snapped and killed"
Day before that we supposedly passed something to keep modmail free of garbage.
So in the four days since we passed the rule, there has been at least one new piece of shite clogging my intertubes daily. It's starting to feel like email, where I ~~have~~ get to wade through some new turd each morning. Funny at first, then the novelty wears off and you realize it's just poop. 
If people really need to scratch that itch, I propose PornOverlordsCircleJerk.
I pre-ordered Star Wars The Old Republic the day pre-orders started. I got everything registered and was ready for the head start. When I got ready to play it kept telling me my code was already in use. 
I started with support email and didn't get anywhere. On Dec 17 I made my first call. The woman said she would email me a new code. She never sent one to my email. I called them back the next day and told them what the woman told me. I gave them my support ticket number and they told me it was invalid. I asked for a new code and they told me that if I already got a new code they could not give me another. I told them that I didn't get the code and they said the ticket number was not in the system anyway. They told me to call Bioware.
I called bioware and they told me they could not help me since I bought it through Origin. I kept calling Origin and trying to get it escalated. They kept telling me there was nothing they could do and to use Bioware support since my code was already in use they could give me a new one. 
On December 31 I was finally done. I called Origin and demanded a refund. They told me they could not give me one. I finally got on with a supervisor who said they could not give me a refund. I told them I was calling my credit card company to have it charged back to them and file a complaint. The supervisor finally said he would email me a new code for the game. I made him stay on the line until I got the email, registered, and was able to log in the game. I said fuck you asshole and hung up on him. Of course by this time all of my friends that I was going to play and level with were all level 30 or higher. So I had nobody to level with so I cancelled my account. Origin ruined a game for me forever that I was excited about for a long time.
I didn't get to play my pre-ordred SW TOR until Dec 31 because of a bad registration code and horrible customer support. From now on if I can't buy it on Steam I'll just get it from a torrent. Origin and EA wont be getting anymore of my money.
My problem with it isn't that EA is making an online store. My problem is that they're using it in a manner that runs perpendicular to what it should be, and on top of that, they're trying to take market share away from steam in a way that's not right. Steam gets customers by having constant sales, releasing games without DRM, preloading, etc., whereas EA wants to steal that part of the market away from them by releasing their games only on origin. They also don't support the indie scene; steam does. Also, how many horror stories have we seen here about origin? Tons, at least 5 a week on the front page alone. As for steam? I think I've seen 2 the entire time I've been on reddit.
TLDR, Steam is better because of its philosophy on what their service should be. Origin is just there to piggyback on Steam's success.
When I was about five years old, I was homeschooled with my cousin for kindergarten. My mom taught us, and after a little while of learning, I was finally able to read. I was ecstatic. My mom thought I was a genius because I had learned so fast, and my cousin was still having problems with it, so I felt smarter than him.
So, my mother let me choose my first book. I looked through the books for that age level until I came across one that just sounded awesome: My Dog Talks. A talking dog? Air Bud doesn't even talk! This must be pretty legit! So I grabbed it and excitedly ran back to my cousin so I could read it to him. Meanwhile, my mom called my stepdad to tell him that I'm reading. For a few proud moments, I was on top of the world.
So I start to read the book. Immediately, I am disappointed. This dog is not talking; he's barking. "It'll learn to talk soon I bet!" I hoped in vain. It never did. I read through the entire book waiting for the dog to talk as my cousin just sat next to me and laughed. Once I was done, I angrily closed the book back and vowed to never be disappointed in such a way again.

My system is a little different. Since you can pass down a single stat with the Power items, I take all of my Pokemon to the stats judge in the Battle Subway and get them evaluated. Any Pokemon with a stat that "can't be better" are set aside and labeled with that stat (HP, SPD, etc.)
My boxes are sorted by egg group with the perfect-stat Pokemon in a row at the bottom of each. When I breed, I use one parent with a key stat and the corresponding Power item, and one parent with the desired nature and the Everstone. This ensures that half of all your hatchlings will have both a perfect stat and the correct nature. 
I usually then hatch a dozen or so, then take the half-dozen with the right nature and run them through the stats judge. At least one of them will usually be "relatively superior," and sometimes one or two of them will have another perfect stat to go with the one I bred. Good strong Pokemon.

edit: I ignored boiling which was kinda dumb.  The post holds for any gas, though.
Good question.  I went way over length as usual, but if you want any clarification feel free to ask.  To answer the question, we need three ideas:
* [The equipartition theorem](
* [The Boltzmann Distribution]( 
* [Diffusion]( 
The wikipedia articles are linked, but I'll touch on the good bits briefly.
**Equipartition theorem**:  All systems (a molecule, a cup of water, etc.) have ways that they can store energy.  For example, you can pick up kinetic energy by translating, or by rotating.  In 3D there are 3 different directions in which to translate and 3 different directions in which to spin.  The equipartition theorem says that at equilibrium, *the average energy stored in form is equal*, and is related to the temperature of the system.  If you go to the wiki link you’ll see that each way of storing energy holds on average (k)(T)/2, where T is the temperature and k is some constant.  Add up the energy from up/down motion, right/left motion, and forward/back motion and your total kinetic energy is 3(k)(T)/2.  See if you can work backwards to iorgekefld’s result using that tidbit.  So, if you give me a room full of gas and a thermometer, I can tell you the *average* speed at which the molecules are going up and down, side to side, forwards and back, and spinning in each direction.  I can do this without making a single individual measurement, because of the laws of statistical mechanics.  By the way, the number you get out for water is ~640 m/s
**Boltzmann Distribution**:  The EPT tells me the average speed at which things are zooming around, but it doesn’t tell me anything about how that average is formed.  For example, the sets {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and {5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5} certainly look different, but their averages are the same.  One has a wide spread, and the other has a narrow spread.  For our cup of water or room full of gas, what does the spread of speeds look like?  Well, it turns out the spread is given by the Boltzmann distribution, which you can see in the wiki link.  It’s a bell shaped curve which is fat around the center (the *average* speed given to us by EPT) and narrow at the extremes.  What this means is this:  in your cup of water, the average speed of a molecule is ~640 m/s.  You’ll find lots of molecules going 630-650 m/s, fewer going 650-700 m/s, far fewer going 700-1000 m/s, etc etc.  The further you move away from the average (either faster or slower), the fewer molecules you’ll find.
**Diffusion**:  So, we know your water molecules are moving around 640 m/s, and while some are a bit faster and some are a bit slower, our cup is only 7 cm across so surely if we followed a single molecule it would by zipping around the cup like mad, smashing into the walls thousands of times per second, right?  Well, not quite.  The molecules are moving quickly, but they’re packed quite densely so they’re constantly smashing into one another; they never have a chance to move far before they have a collision and zip off in some other direction.  Since there are neighboring water molecules in every direction, we’d expect the single molecule we’re following to not move at all!  If it’s equally likely to get smashed up as down, left as right, forwards as back, then we must (on average) stay put.  You’re stuck inside a mosh pit and surrounded by guys that are all the same size.  However, if we don’t care about what direction we’re going and only about the distance from home we’ve traveled, you’ll see that a molecule does actually wander over time due to random fluctuations in the speeds of its smashing neighbors.  This poor explanation, but a really good illustration is dropping some food coloring in a very still liquid.  You’ll initially have a small dark spot where all the food color molecules were deposited, but over time the spot will widen and get lighter since they’re getting smashed around by neighboring water molecules.  The center will always stay the darkest since on average, the*average* displacement is zero due to the symmetry of the system like we said, but over time the dot will get more and more spread out.   The speed at which the dot ‘spreads’ is closer to the 50 micron/s that iorgekefld was talking about, but the actual speed depends on some further factors.  
: The average speed of molecules in a cup of water is given by the EPT and is roughly 640 m/s at room temp.  Not all molecules have the same speed in a cup of water, and the spread of speeds is given by the Boltzmann distribution.  Molecules are constantly getting smashed around by neighbors in a liquid or gas, and have zero displacement on average.  However if you only care about how far from the starting point they move, you’ll notice motion of a speed scale much, much slower than 640 m/s.

I got this, we're straying into the realm of science:
It's sort of like the Atkin's diet. They don't take any sugar but are allowed to eat fat. The body starts using fat for energy instead of sugar. As a breakdown product of fat they start getting "ketones" in their system. I didn't realise they're calling themselves "keto-members" now but I presume that's what he's getting at. Atkins dieters will smell funny because of the distinctive smell of ketones in their breath (although not everyone can smell ketones...this ability is genetically determined....but we're getting off track here, I'll tell you the rest in person).

It's actually the same word. the reason it looks different is a matter of "inflection." Inflection in linguistics refers to the way that words change as they fill different needs in a sentence. In English, our verb "to be" can be reflected as "am" "is" "was" "were" "has been," etc. Same word, but it looks different depending on how we use it.
In most Semitic languages (like the Aramaic in this part of Daniel), all words have a three consonant root: this one would be transliterated "PRS." This same word would then be inflected in two different ways (by adding the proper phonemes or vowels) based on the syntax of its surroundings.
My Hebrew's pretty good. My Aramaic's pretty bad. That's all I can do here. Hope it helps.
- it's the same word, just looks different because of the inherent madness of human language.
Both Melo and Lin are good at what they're good at. Not sure how this compromising to accommodate each other is working out. Lin slows his pace and loses his aggressiveness whenever Melo's on the court. With Davis in play, Melo's actually making baskets. When Lin's running the court, Melo just looks lost.

Raccoon's are mean little bastards too. I had someone that had one living in their attic. The raccoon had torn the ceder shingles of the roof to make a nice little nest in the insulation in the attic. It rained for a few days and softened the sheet rock in the master bedroom. A night or two latter (let's call him Ed) Ed was sleeping in his bed when the ceiling caved in and a mother raccoon came tumbling onto the bed from the ceiling. Ed jumped up out of bed, ran into the bathroom and shut the door. I get a call at 3 am from Ed saying "Man, something just fell through my ceiling and has me trapped in the bathroom." I couldn't help but laugh, all the while he was telling me that it wasn't funny at all. I ended up driving to Ed's house, woke his son up to let me in, and walked back to the master bedroom. I hear something moving in the bed room and call out for Ed. He is still in the bathroom and yells back to me "It a fucking raccoon and it won't let me out of the bathroom." I crack the door and the raccoon immediately hides, but as soon as I try to come in the room it starts hissing and spitting at me like a cat. I found a large piece of decking in the garage and use it to shield myself from the raccoon as I make my way to the bathroom to get Ed. The raccoon is highly PISSED OFF and doesn't enjoy the fact that I was in the same room as she was. Well, I got Ed out of the bathroom. We went to the local farm supply store and rented a box trap. I then got some wet cat food and a disposable plastic container. Put the cat food in the container taped container shut and poked a few holes in the top. I set the container in the box trap and pushed it through the door into his bedroom. The next day we had our mother raccoon. It doesn't end there though. I still had to crawl up into the attic to get the pups. She had 4 pups and I found 3 alive and 1 dead (I assume it died from starvation, because they didn't have their eyes open yet). I put the pups in a 5 gallon bucket. I put the mom in the trunk inside the box trap and the pups in the back seat. We drove 30 miles to a state park to release them. We walked about 1/4 mile into the woods and set the bucket with the pups by a tree and the box trapped mother a few feet away. As soon as I opened the box trap mom tore out of it, turned around and started growling, hissing, and spitting. We took the trap and walked about 50 yds. away and watched as she turned over the bucket and retrieved a pup. Up a tree and disappeared. We went back to his place to assess the damage (about $1,500 in just materials).
Friend had a raccoon fall on him in his sleep and was trapped in the bathroom for several hours before I rescued him.
Back in the day, my dad had one of those "[Snappy]( things by the now-defunct "Play" company. It took snapshots from composite or S-Video sources. I used that and a frame-step VCR to meticulously record and stitch together the whole thing into a tiny little video (I was going to say MPEG, but it's probably more likely given the timeframe that I was using AVI and something terrible like CinePak or something, the resulting video was huge).
I then somehow lost it (I'm guessing because I erased the (at the time) giant video to make room for a game or something), and I've been mourning ever since. 
 Ah, my lunch!
&gt;take you seriously

This is what it's really about. It isn't about intellectual honesty, or pursuit of truth, or social progress, it's about which dickfiddling monkeyman has the more social currency and privilege.
What you hate is that I have my own system of currency and don't give a fuck about your patriarchal dick-bux. People like you can't stand that. you can't stand that I am using satire to make a serious point, because the implication is that you aren't worth giving a legitimate scholarly reply to. You wouldn't even understand it. It infuriates that sense of god-given priviledge that you feel in your bones without having ever legitimately questioned it.

you are butthurt that I am pointing out your own bias and privileged point of view.

You are truly a shining example of an average ratheist. You are also very Christian (in the worst way possible.)
Yikes, man.  Please, do me a favor and don't seek that stuff out anymore.  
Synthetic cannibinoids are fucking awful.  I've seen people reach a threshold on JWH-018 that made them catatonic.  I've been there too, and I'll never, ever do it again.  I literally couldn't communicate or cognitively function, and not in any sort of recreational way--that stuff is dangerous.  Take a look at the tripled carbon molecules in all JWH chemical structures--I don't have anything to prove it but any drug that has that specific pattern seems to exhibit strong, negative effects at certain doses.  
 That stuff is really awful, and there's a reason it's not around anymore.  I'm not trying to be combative, but I strongly suggest you stay away.
Creates way more problems than it's worth:
1. Many websites will label it as an invalid email address, now you need to fill out the form again
2. Many mailing lists will allow `+` in an email address when signing up, but inexplicably the "unsubscribe" script will not recognize the same address as valid, which means *there's no way to unsubscribe*. This has happened to me, a *lot*.
3. Any good spammers just remove the `+foo` part from your address anyway
TL:DR; seems like a good idea, it's actually horrible
So I went out test riding today. Found myself a 2010 or 2011 Quintana Roo CD0.1 in that obnoxious green and yellow paint scheme. I really liked the way it felt on the bike, other than the fact that it crushed my junk, which is exactly why I have a breakaway saddle.
I also tried an older felt b16 and a speed concept 7.0 or 7.2, but the b16 felt too much like my road bike, and while the speed concept had similar geometry to the felt, at 5'10" (with a long torso and arms) a medium frame size wasn't comfortable. Oh, and it wasn't obnoxiously coloured.
 I found a bike that fits wonderfully and I really like. It's also [really obnoxious](
irrelevant... but if you must know-
In middle school German class we had to pick our favorite color from a sheet of examples. Rosa was shown as a baby pink so I asked what the word would be for a hot pink / neon pink / fuchsia type color. My brilliant teacher told me that color doesn't exist in German. I asked how a German would distinguish it from another shade of pink and she said "they don't". Therefore my friends and I referred to the color as "schpink" and it eventually was shortened to "spink". At one point I had learned the actual name for that shade of pink but now forget. 
a joke I thought was funny when I was 12 and has since stuck. 
Let me just offer you some friendly advice.
First, your thing is way overwhelming. The typical anon is a fickle motherfucker. If you can't adequately express your entire idea in a few catch sentences, nobody is going to sit around reading your book. This can be fixed by simply presenting your idea in a more creative way.
Second, I think you are working with too much structure. What I noticed as a pattern in a lot of these projects is that we tend to start out with all of these ideas of how to run an op or project by following a seemingly sound system. However, in the end, you are also working with the same old fickle motherfuckers. People won't stick to rigid rules, policies, and frameworks. Anon projects generally can't be run bureaucratically like a business, especially if you do not have a very solid starting group that understands your systems inside-out. This obstacle can probably be rectified with a huge ambiguity-ectomy, and through removal of all but the most necessary regulations.
Finally, the idea of putting together a meeting of representatives from every cell or project (or even the idea of obtaining a decent sample size) is bad news from the start. There are Anon groups who downright despise each other. There are Anon groups who you would never even be able to track down. There are Anon groups who would outright refuse to participate. Even if successful, this "intra-anonymous" dynamic will cause your project to end up as yet another faction-entity within Anon, which I think is contrary to your unified representation goal. Anon is decentralized to a point that unification would not only be impossible, but even an attempt at unification might be seen as a transgression to some cells. This, I believe, is the real problem here, and I'm not sure how to rectify it.
This all sounds really cool on paper but I think it is too great in scope and too heavy in technicalities. it won't be so pretty in execution.
I bought new shoes as well not long ago. I got huuuuge blisters under my right foot after i ran about 10K on the first run. I didn't give up just yet, so after a break my foot had healed, I went for another 10K.. huuge blisters again. After recovering again (using my other pair of shoes) my feet and shoes cooperate just fine :) 
 Just give it some time :)
I've been running this deck with doomed travelers instead of delvers for the past couple days. They seem to work well, but the opponents don't really care too much if they're getting pinged for one a turn, so they don't kill them. So I looked for an alternative, and delvers were a strong choice. I wasn't too convinced they were better, so i asked Reddit, hence le thread. I wanted to eventually get some Snapcasters in for more control.
I will probably take out the Looters when i get snaps and ponders in, but for now they are working extremely well at getting the flashback of Unburial Rites going turn 4 for the Reavers. I've also had ridiculous success with the Kindred, as it potentially brings out a Dungeon geist for more lockdown, a captain for buffs, a geist of saint traft for the trickery itself provides, as well as the Reavers, which give ridiculous draw power and board control when hexproof and buffed to 6/8 double strike.
I will definitely try out the Midnight Hauntings, but I'm unsure of what to take out exactly.
I have had problems with board wipes, but that can always be sideboard hated against.
And if reanimator becomes a problem, a couple Nihil Spellbombs / Extractions can always be sided in.
**tl,dr: I've been running it for a couple days and it works marvelously. A bit more control would help, but that comes with snapcasters, which I will be getting at some point. Thanks for the advice, and I'm sure I will *Finkel* around with it.**
you are confusing DUI with DWI. 
DWI: driving while intoxicated. this is for someone whos alocohol level is above 0.08.
DUI: driving under the influance. this is for someone who is either intoxicated below the legal limit or tests positive for illicit drugs. this means that although you were not above the level for intoxication you had consumed enough that your driving abilities were impared. 
you tested positive close enough to the limit and you did not preform the field sobriety test adequately (this is why the commanding officer was called)
Well, [Orgasticcarnival's video]( explains the voting process pretty well. So if you don't know much about the alternate vote, you should watch that. Single-transferable voting is basically the same, but modified for races where there will be multiple equivalent seats awarded.
Anyway, once you have proportional representation, people can vote for third party candidates while still avoiding the spoiler effect. Say, for the sake of example, that Santorum gets the nomination and Ron Paul runs as an independent. You might be dissatisfied with Obama and scared of Santorum. So you'd prefer for Ron Paul to be elected. However, you're more scared of Santorum than you are dissatisfied with Obama, and you're worried that if too many people vote for Paul, Santorum will win. So you vote for Obama despite preferring Paul. This phenomenon prevents people from voting for a third party candidate.
The alternate vote gets rid of this deterrent against voting for third-party candidates. And in multiple-seat elections, the single-transferable vote prevents wasted votes. The net result is that it's much easier for independent/third-party candidates to receive votes and you end up with representatives that actually, oh, I dunno, represent their constituencies. Presumably proportionally to their population.
***: Proportional representation lets third party candidates get elected by allowing people to "safely" vote for the candidate(s) they most agree with. This destroys the false dichotomy at the heart of American politics.
This reply will more than likely be buried, but I have a somewhat related (although not directly involved) story.
A few months ago I was looking at a ranch online that catered to horses.  I can't remember how I got there, but around that same time my cat decided to start making noise in the other room.  After giving my cat a few treats and sitting back down at the computer I thought to myself:  "Man, wouldn't it be awesome if they had a cat ranch!?"  I decided to see if Google agreed with me.
Come to find out, the Caboodle Ranch exists!  I was very excited that this place existed, and even more excited when I saw the publicity photos.  Not only was it a cat ranch, but it was also a rescue which included a CAT TOWN!!!  I continued to check out the website and eventually found the owner's story.
To say the story was heartfelt and "aww" inspiring is an understatement.  I immediately felt some sort of connection to someone who has committed his life to saving cats.  Stray cats are a big problem in the college town I live in.  Rotten people discard their cats when they leave for summer.  It was nice to imagine a place where people can bring their unwanted cats. 
So, I wanted to do something.  I'm currently enrolled in college and so the only thing I could think of was to donate.  There was a donation page on the Caboodle Ranch website.  I had my credit card in hand, but something didn't seem right.  I don't donate to charities until I'm fully convinced my money is going to something worthwhile.  I decided to do a little bit more research on the ranch before I invested a bit of money.
What I discovered was a Facebook page dedicated to putting a stop to the Caboodle Ranch run (at least in part) by someone who had volunteered their.  
  (WARNING: CONTAINS REALLY SAD PICTURES OF CATS.)
Now, don't get me wrong, I've seen websites dedicated to animal cruelty before.  I always take their claims with a grain of salt.  The story they relayed, however, wasn't so much about the owner's cruelty, but more about how one man operating alone can't possibly take care of that many cats.  The pictures are a bit horrifying and once the whole idea of how cool a cat ranch would be faded I realized that given the same circumstances no one would be able to support something like that.
More than likely, something had to be done about that place.  Without the proper support, the Caboodle Ranch was a place unwanted cats were abandoned.  One man supporting them led to some pretty disturbing situation.  Cats died and were left without a burial.  According to the Facebook page, many were eaten by wild animals that live in the area.  While the intention was a loving place for unwanted cats, the result was a one man operation that left many of the cats in situations that weren't any better than the wild they would have been thrown into.

I was going to donate to Caboodle Ranch until I saw what was happening to a man overwhelmed by trying to single-handedly take care of hundreds of cats.


But the chain frost example isn't really right - the team with the lich chose a shitty place to fight, or didn't have enough aoe to clear out the creeps before dropping his ulti. That's a gameplay or picking failure (or success, depending on who made the good/bad decision/forces the fight)
Similarly, soul catcher is incredibly potent, and has that enormous aoe to glance it out. You do realise that it works through disruption, right? That landing the skill correctly is one ofthe pitfalls of it being so balls out insanely strong?
Neither of those are random, they are gameplay and skill enablers. Bash I can get behind, evasion I can get behind, axe's fucking ridiculous helix I can get behind, but none of the things you suggested are remotely close to random, and if they are being random, you're just playing badly. 
Tiny is the only thing you suggested that is even a little bit right, but people still consistently manageto Ava/toss and instant kill people repeatedly, by getting their positioning right. If it were any easier to do, he'd be borderline imbalanced.
yes, anything that's %luck passive i can see the argument for (though high % stuff matters less, axe's helix is shit) but anything that is "random unit in aoe" just means place the damn aoe better.
I sing. I was asked to sing at a church, a very big church with a true auditorium type stage, complete with an orchestra pit and seating for thousands.  After my performance, walking down the steps I tripped on my four inch heels and went head over feet off the stage. I was wearing a short skirt and backless undies. Was the most popular girl with all the single church guys for a while. Helped that, at the time, I was 24 year old, 5'10" blonde with a great heiny. Which everyone got a free preview of.
TL, DR- mooned a church full of about a thousand people.
It is likely because it was cheaper to hire a new, fresh face for a role that wasn't exactly huge in the first season.  Gregor will play a larger role this season, and as much as I enjoyed seeing Conan Stevens, perhaps he does not yet, at this early stage in his career, have the acting chops that HBO wanted when he'd have more screen time and lines.  Rather than try to find the perfect actor in season 1 and pay them the kind of salary a seasoned professional would take in for just a few scenes and 2 or 3 lines, they saved money by hiring a cheaper actor for the small roll, leaving more to pay for effects, costumes, Sean Bean, etc.  This is also probably why certain characters are not being introduced this season and being held until they have more importance.  Why find the perfect actor to play the Damphair now, and pay him now, for one scene with Theon, when you can have Theon greeted by a random priest of the drowned god and introduce Damphair when the Greyjoy plotlines are more prominent?  That's what I think the reasoning is.  It's the same reason they had a hooded extra playing Jaqen in the final scene of season 1, and why Beric will possibly be recast as well.
***:  Rather than pay a seasoned actor for a handful of scenes and lines in season 1, they cast a green (and cheaper) actor for when there isn't much of the character, and recast with someone more costly and skilled when the role expands, since this is an expensive show and they need to be careful with their budget.
My wife died 3 years ago July 1st. We buried her on the 4th. We were both atheists, but her Presbyterian family insisted on a traditional religious service. I figured that if that's what her parents needed to help them through their grief, then I would not object.
So the pastor (or whatever his title was) starts the service and goes on for 45 minutes about kids dying in the bible, and parents grieving. Suffice to say, this did NOT help her family. 
Once the chapel service was done, and we moved out to the cemetery, I told him to fuck off because he was upsetting my mother-in-law and royally pissing me off.
So I stood there in 102 degree heat on the 4th of July and gave her a proper graveside eulogy. The more devout of the mourners got pissed at me, but weren't disrespectful enough to say anything to us. Her parents virtually tackled me in tears, thanking me over and over.
- Told pastor to fuck off at my atheist wife's funeral. 
to be fair, those characters unlocked in previous games were generally mirrors. 
These are characters with different fighting styles and movesets. 
Also not to be a dick, but games are more expensive to make these days. I can think of 3 people involved in the creation of a new character at min nowadays: animator, character artist, and systems designer. This is assuming one of them even knows how to rig, or has a really efficient toolchain, and disregarding QA completely. Even then, this is a pretty optimistic pipeline for a single character. 
So let's say it takes a solid month per character, and you were working 3 months on content(optimistic), and you are paying them $25 an hour that's about $144,000 right there for 4 small teams. Since a lot of jobs can be overlapped, let's plan for a straight and *very* optimistic $100,000. Again this is wholly optimistic, it will be much more with test and other jobs like concept artists, AUDIO, writers, production teams, and additional engineers, and support staff. 
Ok, so the DLC will cost $20, let's assume PSN/Live will take a 40% cut because we are capcom and this is a *good* deal. We'll get $12 excluding taxes(which are another issue entirely so let's ignore it). We need to sell ~8,333 copies of dlc to break even. Now in my own(and many others) history less than 5% of your users will convert and buy dlc no matter what it is. Let's give them a benefit of the doubt and say 5% buy it. Using VGChartz we get about ~10,500 conversions. 
So that's about 20% profit, which is probably the marker they planned for when deciding if dlc was even viable. 
** Shits expensive nowadays**
I think he still has the drive to get to 19. I think to him, that's priority #2. 
Does he want it as bad as when he won his first Masters and when he had the Tiger Slam? Want? Yes. Prioritize as #1. No.
He's said numerous times his kids are now #1.
However, when I see any great... and I mean truly great (not just a pro... but the cream of the crop)... they are not great because they are more talented than everyone else. These guys on tour are amazing. They can putt lights out, get up and down from everywhere, etc. It's not their skill that separates the great pros from the truly great ones. The cream of the crop.
It's a mindset. They have a better mental game than all their competitors. That's what gives them the extra tiny bit to get them into the top 0.1% of athletes. Take anyone from the top 0.1% of athletes. Michael Jordan. Kobe Bryant. Wayne Gretsky. Jack. Tiger. Whoever.
None of these guys are there because they were more talented than everyone else. The thing that makes a 0.1% upper echelon athlete succeed is a mental attitude not shared by the other 99.9%. 
Take the sport most rife with drugs as an example. Tour de france, bodybuilding, whatever. Those sports are drug fueled. Take two clones. Same mental attitudes, same physical attributes. Put one on drugs, and the other not on drugs. Who wins? In those sports you simply can't compete without the use of drugs anymore because someone will just come along with your same physicaly attirbutes and mental attitude but they will take drugs, and crush you.
The same goes for the upper 0.1% of athletes. You simply can't be in the top 0.1% on talent alone because someone else will come along... have your exact skill... but will have a mental fortitude 10 times greater... and crush you.
Tiger has not stumbled upon 14 Majors because of a crazy talent he has. There have been greater ball strikers, short game artists, and putters. Does anyone out there dare say he struck the ball better than Hogan, had the short game of Seve, of putts better than Crenshaw. Well, he might be the best putter the game has ever seen.
However, what has got him their is the attitude instilled in him by his father and mother from age 2 to age 20 and beyond. 
I would go as far to say that by looking at who a child is between 2-18... you can determine with 90% accuracy what they will be like when they are 30. Often the things parents instill in you as children never change. They become a part of you.
Tiger got to 14 by having an upper echelon 0.1% mental game. A burning desire greater than perhaps anyone. THAT is what his got him to 14. 
Now, you're asking "is he content with his accomplishments". A person like this... simply cannot be content. If he were the content type of person, he'd probably have less than a handful of majors based on his skill. People don't simply go from having possibly the greatest burning desire of any athlete in this generation to being content. He wakes up everyday... much like his dad taught him... "how can I be better today than I was yesterday".
It's like a catch 22. You want to be content with becoming the greatest golfer of all time... but to get to be the greatest golfer of all time... you cannot have a content attitude. You'll never become the greatest (as previously mentioned... someone will come along with all your skill and physical attributes... but they will come along with the burning desire attitude you don't possess... and crush you). Instead... you must have a burning desire like no one else, never being content, but always striving each day to be better than the previous... and then... when your desire pays off and everything comes to fruition... and maybe Tiger wins 19 Majors... you still aren't content. Because you aren't a content kind of guy. You still wake up, retired, having won 19, and still want to better than you were yesterday.
That's what separates upper echelon athletes from the rest.
**** "It's like a catch 22. You want to be content with becoming the greatest golfer of all time... but to get to be the greatest golfer of all time... you cannot have a content attitude. You'll never become the greatest (as previously mentioned... someone will come along with all your skill and physical attributes... but they will come along with the burning desire attitude you don't possess... and crush you).

Well aren't you a lucky duck! I just read about just such a scenario last week in Marvin Harris' *Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches*
I'll paraphrase:
Prof. Richard Lee of the University of Toronto had been spending time with the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert and thought it would be nice to get them all something for Christmas. He purchased for his friends a nice fat ox for a feast. When he presented the ox to the tribesmen they ridiculed it and asked Lee why would waste his money on such a thin and sickly looking beast. The Bushmen said they would eat it but they doubted that the ox, which was in fact very meaty, would fill them up. Lee eventually asked for an explanation. The Bushmen told him:
*Yes, of course we knew all along what the ox was really like, but when a young man kills much meat he comes to think of us as his servants or inferiors. We cannot accept this. We refuse one who boasts, for someday his pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of his meat as worthless. This way we cool his heart and make him gentle.*
 If you start thinking that you're hot shit in a champagne glass, your bushmen friends will start letting you know you ain't but cold diarrhea in a dixie cup.
To be honest, in my opinion the best part of seminars is the networking opportunities. The really significant ideas that I've learned have been from books and plain old experience.





Personally I would get a book in an area that I'm interested in and go off to some relaxing environmental if I had a week off. That said I'm sure there are seminars out there that will give you a chance to learn some new things.

Anyhow you asked for the "best programs". This is a little hard to say since it really depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. That said I'll give it a shot and name some well respected programs that I've gone though and give you my opinion on them

Books:
*Feeling Good:The New mood Therapy* 
My top pick. I found it to be invaluable in dealing with tough times, since I was making a choice that baffled many of my friends and family and needed to find the will to keep going in that direction even when I was constantly reminded of the easier(and less fulfilling) way  out. 
To summarize it, it details a program to follow that will help you re frame negative thoughts into more inspiring and useful things. It's important to actually follow what the program says to do (only takes about 15min a day). I have given this book as a gift only to hear *it has some good ideas*. WTF? Do they read  personal fitness books only to say *running 20 min a day, sounds like a good idea* and then leave it at that?

I'm getting off topic, point is it worked for me and follows the practices of one of the most effective forms of therapy known. 

*Getting Things Done*
Most favorably reviewed organizational book in the market

What's an organizational book doing in this list, you may ask. Well I personally found that when I really throw my self at a BIG projects I canlose my self in the small details. And often find my self forgetting things. You may say *i got a calender, what do I need this for*, well maybe you don't but I have found that when you're really doing your best you tend to block everything else out which can lead you things falling in the cracks. The peace of mind I get know knowing that all the lose my lose ends are in one place i s great. So is not waking up at midnight,sweating, suddenly remembering something that I has to be taken care of right then. Trust me, the more plates that are spinning in your life, the more you will benefit from this book.


*The new Psycho-Cybernetics*
Assuming you have read even the smallest bit of self help out there you know the importance of having goals. What's next you ask? If you read this and do what it says, it *will* make you into a more driven and motivated person. I can guarantee you that. When ever I feel like I down and need some inspiration to go on in the face of adversity (which is becoming a less common thing I can happily say), I pick up this or *Feeling Good* and doing some of the exercises they mention. It has helped me so much.


Audio and video Tapes:

Tony Ribbons
I'm going to go ahead and put tony ribbons into one category because that's what I did when I select tapes to hear. Basically I got an astounding amount of his work off the web and went thought is like a chain smoke going though packs, like a mad man. The irony of *stealing* work that was meant to help me reach a *more successful lifestyle* did not escape me.

So what do I think of all this? I have to say that there were many times while hearing or viewing a tape of his that I reached a level of inspiration and feelings of confidence that where unknown to me at that time. And I did accomplish some worthwhile feats. During the time I was on the program, that is. A few weeks later and I realized that I wasn't on that **I can do anything ** high so I went though another program, so on until some six months later I am sad to say that the most well known and respected motivation speaker did not make any lasting changing in my life. I know that sounds painful and results may very of course but I felt like I didn't' really get much out of this. Oh, and some parts of his programs were based on lies, not that I can blame him, how can one man be expected to know all their is to know about life?

Richard Bandler tapes:
Co-creater of NLP a very well known form of change therapy.
Same as above. VERY motivational while listening, hell sometime I felt like crying, that's how moved I was by what he said but after a few weeks back to the same old. That said he does give some advice though out his tapes that I found I could follow (not like Tony that says *hang around rich people to become one yourself*, while it is actually sound advice it's not easy to put into practice) and I did learn somethings that thanks to his charismatic way of telling them I now, months later, still remember.He did say things that actually hindered my progress because I couldn't get his advice to work despite the confidence with witch he said this. So in my experience it's was a zero sum game.

random note: Richard may very well be the most charismatic person I have ever heard speak.


So what does this leave us with? I found that after reading my three recommend books (and countless other self help books that were utter crap) the most helpful thing I did was set my self a few humble goals and work towards them. And during the work I saw what I read happen before my eyes, crystallizing in my mind the principles I had read about making it easier to do what I already knew was the right thing to do. Because despite what the amount of self help literature seems to imply, most of us already know what the best course of action is, we just have doubts about the effectiveness of those actions or our ability to do partake in that action. And the only way to really rid your self of those doubts is to go and do those things. 
Wow, spent much more time answering your question than I thought I would. Well, that's it for now. If there are any questions feel free to ask, as I've gone through nearly every self help program in the market.

If you can't even get yourself to read though this, how will you find the initiative to succeed in your life? Will power is like a muscle, now go exercise that muscle by reading this!
I think you are a bit confused. They used perfectly reasonable statistical tools, in fact that made it harder to see the experimental flaws.
The flaws were methodological. 
1- they got equivocal behavioural results, with non-granular data then averaged it all together.
2- they demonstrated variation in 2 tiny neuron subtypes in specific locations that have no known relationship to neurodevelopmental or behavioural disorders

I can see no reason they chose to average the behavioural results, or to select those neuronal groups. It is therefore suspicious that those decisions resulted in statistical significance.
TL:DR
The stats were fine. The inputs are dubious. 
And the result is "worth a better study". This is science. Peer review, right? 
Here's a nice excerpt from a forum post briefly explaining what Creatine is:
&gt; Creatine is an organic acid. It is a 3 amino acid protein, made of arginine, glycine and methionine. The primary benefit of creatine is that it is physically used as the energy base for our most powerful energy system: the Creatine Phosphate system. This produces more ATP per second than any other energy system our body has and directly powers our efforts for the first 10-15s of contraction. Pure strength training is powered primarily by creatine, and supplementation will help you get stronger faster. There are many secondary effects of creatine which you can read about on your own. They are not important for the purposes of this article. 
&gt; Because our body does not have to MAKE much creatine when we supplement with it, the amino acids that would normally be sacrificed to creatine production can be used for muscle building, new blood cell generation, etc. Why does this matter? Well, our bodies do maintenance all the time, but it isn't magic. If your body is trying to make more muscle, it needs arginine and methionine. Sure, there are other amino acids involved, but guess what: IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME YOU AREN'T BUILDING ANY MUSCLE. Creatine supplementation allows us MAXIMIZE the healing process by making the protein you take after your workout directly available for healing instead of healing + creatine regeneration.
*** - It's not bad for you and it's not some magic powder to make you super strong either. It'll just help give you a bit of extra energy to do your reps (you can train at a higher intensity) and help you recover.
You may experience dryness in the throat as well as stomach cramps when you first start out using it - I'm no expert on this so I can't tell you exactly why but it's something along the lines of the creatine drawing water away from other parts of the body to do its work. Just drink a few extra glasses of water with every serve and you'll be fine.
YES!
This week I had a guy on my lab team who didn't help with shit. Me and a colleague worked on the experience while a third was on the computer building the spreadsheet.
He spent the 4 hours on his own just copying data and doing his own math on his 50g.
The only time he opened his mouth was to complain about the person with the spreadsheet because she wasn't working on the order of magnitude he wanted.

 Dude doesn't help then complains.
&gt;No need to downvote.
Yeah, no. I guess you don't have RES. You have three downvotes dude. Three upvotes too. That's why it seems like you only have one I guess, and if you don't have RES it would seem like your downvote came from your single commenting detractor.
 I'm not your shooter.
Aha! This is a thread I am perfect for-I've written papers on both celiac disease and psoriatic arthritis.
First of all, gluten intolerance is a valid condition that is currently emerging. We know practically nothing about it currently, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion-a patient has to be negative for wheat allergies and for celiac disease and improve on a gluten free diet.
Now, one of the things I work on is the natural killer receptor NKG2D.  NKG2D is an activating homodimer that allows T cells to kill independently of T cell activation when IL-15 is present.  We found that NKG2D is activated in IELs from celiac patients, and that this pathway was critical for disease pathogenesis.  The interesting thing though is that we also demonstrated that NKG2D was involved in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, but via NK cells.
However, if you're asking about psoriasis itself, that's a different story.  Psoriasis is caused by overproliferation of skin cells in response to cytokines produced by immune cells, particularly IL-22.  Thus far there have been no links between NKG2D and the skin disorder to my knowledge.
 As far as I know celiac will not make psoriasis worse but it may lead to psoriatic arthritis, which 1 in 3 psoriasis patients suffer from.
Speaking as a former future educator, it goes a little like this.  
When you learn a new skill, you need assistance, or *scaffolding*. This is the teacher assisting there pupils with required tasks, so that the pupil can learn how to do it unassisted.  
Broadly speaking, your tasks will fall into one of three categories:  
1. Those that the child can do, without assistance  
2. Those that the child cannot do, even with assistance  
3. Those that the child can do, with assistance  
Teachers aim for that last category, because it promotes the child's learning. The first category may be used to cement certain skills (eg learning to write cursive, verb conjugations, spelling, etc).  
When aiming for the third category, teachers sometimes may **overestimate** the child's ability/competence and assign them something of the second category - those that they cannot do, even with assistance. In these instances, the blame lies with them, for not assessing the child's competence.  
However, when they are assigning your child something that they can do if they are given assistance it generally occurs in the classroom. But here's the thing - if it occurs whilst doing homework, there is no reason why you should not assist the child **if you are able to do so**. There is nothing worse than a parent misinforming the child, then teachers having to correct their misconceptions (which takes a lot of effort).  
However, parents have a role to play in assisting the child also. If you cannot do it personally, then find someone that can - your partner, a neighbour, friend, etc. To assume that learning should occur **only** in the classroom is naive.  
Furthermore, if a child continues to have difficulty in doing their homework for a particular subject, despite efforts of the teacher (who, by the way,  is also managing a number of other children's learning), then you might want to look at getting additional support in the form of a tutor (or again, a friend, partner, etc who is knowledgeable in that area).
** Teachers exist to teach in the classroom, and they aim for certain activities. If children need help at home, give it to them *or make them ask at school***

I'm actually curious as to what a soul actually is?  I'm assuming it is your "soul" the would transcend to heaven correct?  
If your soul closely resembles any idea of "self" then that would be a construct of the mind.  You'd be surprised of how many areas of your brain I could cut and you'd have no idea the who, what, when, where, or how of anything.  The brain is such a magnificent organ that literally constructs every little thing, even the idea of you believing in a soul.  
But if the soul is some celestial entity that climbs into "heaven" then I follow your logic metaphorically.  But literally speaking, you'd need your brain to function in order to actually be yourself in heaven and actually compute the environment that heaven is.
What's a soul because if your brain dies, "you" (the computation of self by the brain) wouldn't be in heaven.
1. Make sure you're alert in school. If you're staying up until 2 in the morning and not eating much, of course you're not going to be able to focus in class. On the days that I have to say up late to finish a project or something, I can never comprehend subjects as well the day after. 
2. Apparently exercising is supposed to help you focus and be more healthy and shit. I wouldn't know because I'm too lazy to try it. 
3. Participate in class. I know, the last thing you want to do at 9 in the morning in history class is raise your hand and offer your opinion, but it really does help you be more alert. 
3. You sound like you may be trying too hard to be perceived as smart. The smartest people I know come off as normal human beings first, and geniuses second. On the flip side, my ex-boyfriend comes off as pretty nerdy and intelligent. After spending a long time getting to know him, I realized that he was just an average Joe who liked using big words and talking about confusing subjects to impress people, and he was incapable of using logic or making rational decisions on his own. Do not try to turn every conversation into a contest to impress the other person with your intelligence. Don't focus on 'coming off as intelligent' to boost your own ego; instead, focus on actually learning the material and not giving a shit about other people's opinions. By the way, I'm not bashing you. I'm just warning you not to focus too much on whether people perceive you as smart, because then you get distracted from learning the things that will actually make you smart. Chances are, you're a pretty smart guy who has trouble focusing. 

 Sleep, exercise, participate, don't be like my ex-boyfriend. 
She shared the prize with [Leymah Gbowee]( and [Tawakel Karman]( 
And she got the prize for what she has done in one field, not because she's the perfect woman that has no faults of her own from "our" perspective.
Does her views on gays reduce what she's done for womens rights? I hardly think so. Does it bother me that she's for such a law? Yes. It however does not at point reduce what she's done in other parts of her life for which she and two other women got the Nobel Peace Prize for. 
I try not to think that just because someone get's the recognition of the peace price / gain some political office / other recognition that they are saints and have done nothing "wrong" at some point in their life. 
**People are people; and people are assholes.**
Nobel Peace Prize just don't have the credibility of Nobel Prizes in the sciences. Awards for Physics, Chemistry and so on are given out years or even decades after the accomplishments/discoveries so the impact of these achievements are more properly validated. And then we got the Peace Prize which is awarded on current events. It's like a more prestigious r/politics circlejerk. The nature of the peace prize is inherently political, and it take years for the legacies of political actions to take shape. Instead of exercising the same type of caution and reserve they typically do for the awards in the sciences, the peace prize likes to jump on the current event bandwagon and this is what happens.
The Nobel Peace Prize committee needs to know that they are not the same thing as the Times Person of the Year. 
As a gay man, I would like to say that while you are correct, it is a very difficult political situation to navigate. Sirleaf has to retain some political capital, so pushing gay equality would be detrimental. The situation is further complicated, as you can read later in the article, by US aid policy being ostensibly now based on human rights, which seems to have backfired in Liberia. So while I don't agree with her, I recognize that the situation us more delicate than all that. One thing I hope for is increased attention towards education so hopefully the young people of Liberia can learn and avoid the mistakes of their predecessors. 
- Politics are complicated.
I get what you're saying, and in 99% of these threads you'll see the usual 'we need to help these people because they're utterly incapable of taking care of themselves or having any kind of agency' because they're barbaric etc.
I don't think that's not reason to condemn the real harms that occur. I definitely think you should be *far* more critical of your own locality, though. And also to identify the huge double standard between western practices and western practices being practiced by what is perceived as the Other.
Let's not kid ourselves, the proscription of homosexuality is textbook Abrahamic religion stuff, and Liberia is Christian as hell. I also think there tends to be a great deal more commonality between many cultures today than people recognize, simply because colonialism is not a one way street.
I've been rambling because I'm tired, but 
tl;dr
I feel it's okay to judge if you do so in a very reflexive and cautious manner, and look to the 'heart' of the matter (heart of darkness reference accidental), which tends to indict the behavior of our own society more than any others anyway.
Here's my take on it...
Americans are very competitive I think.  We like to be the greatest country in the world, on the greatest planet in existence.  We like to win all of the gold medals at the olympics, and we even get pumped about the world cup even though nobody gives a shit about soccer.  Also...Jesus.
We overreact.  Just think about "Black Friday" and the swarms of people that go out to buy the latest shit at Best Buy. Ever seen what happens at the grocery store when there is a tornado warning?  People overbuy water, milk, and eggs that will probably succumb to rot.
Now apply these characteristics to the dating scene. Once you hit early/mid twenties, you start noticing that a lot of the good girls are being scooped up by guys that are stupid enough to commit to a lifetime of marriage. I think it's much smarter to wait, but how can you wait when you notice that the good ones are being taken?
It's like you are in a race and taking your time just means that you'll lose.  Sure, you can wait for a divorcee - you know that about 1/2 of all the young women getting married today will get a divorce, but do you really want to marry a woman that has already been married, has a ton of baggage, and probably has a jaded view of men/relationships/marriage?
when you run across a beautiful young woman who is married, you experience the same thoughts that drive people to buy up all the milk and eggs because of a tornado warning.  A lot of that milk will spoil
The fallacy of reviews is that it's always base on a second or third party source. The only true way of review of anything is personal experience. That being said, I deem the best way of reviewing is to shown the game itself with as little spoilers as possible, and let the viewers decide. Similarly, a 5-10 mins vid about the basic story, the game mechanics (how to level up, can or how do you customize), follow by someone competent playing the game for another 5 mins is pretty much all you need.    
    - Smelling a steak is better at judging a steak than watching a video about it, watching a video is better than reading about it, but nothing beats actually **eating** that steak. (For perverts, replace steak = boobs, smell = look, and eat = touch and you get the picture)
It what what the old timers called a book, it is a volume of paper filled with nothing but text. It is the personification of  mad men must have be involved in its concoction.
Just to give an idea of scale: the Battle of Stalingrad alone resulted in the deaths of probably a million people in five months (Soviet casualties are difficult to separate into deaths, missing, and wounded; counting wounded it's much larger), roughly ten times the total casualties in the American Revolutionary War.
The Soviets lost almost 14% of their population to WWII. The Americans lost roughly .9% to the Revolutionary War (although in terms of casualties compared to population, it's second only to the Civil War for the US).
I guess that got a little number-y, but the is this: apparently people have no concept of scale in war, particularly the writer of that line. The difference in the numbers is staggering, and even the more qualitative assessment of brutality falls short in the face of the horror of modern war. It's not to say that the Revolutionary War wasn't brutal, but rather that we've gotten exceptionally good at killing and inflicting misery on a massive scale, which is *why we should stop doing it.*
I was really hoping ACIII would have been set in the Netherlands during the Dutch Golden Age, with the Thirty Years' War as a backdrop.
Then I was hoping ACIV would have been in the French Revolution... 
BUT instead we got the American Revolution, because all the high school AC fans who have a limited knowledge of history begged for that setting. 
- Sometimes fans don't know whats best.

Henry had a problem with his firebox that prevented him from making sufficient steam. As a result Sir Tophamhat had to buy "special coal" presumably with a higher heating value so that it burned hotter. See this [Wikipedia link]( for more detail. 
Shortly after starting to use the special coal Henry got in a crash and was rebuilt with a new firebox which eliminated the need for the special coal.
 Henry had a prescription for "special" coal due to a genetic condition. He often pushed his "special" coal on the other engines to make a little extra cash.
There always is a supply around right now, just not from dispensaries.  It might not be right down the street from me, but it is a phone call away. If anything, knowing someone who will make house calls gives someone more access than an area with dispensaries. I.e. "hmm, do I want to drive? or do I want to call John?"
Still, even if it does become legal, it is in no way near as dangerous as alcohol, and as long as people practice [responsible use]( how is it in any way different from anything that is currently legal? I won't drive drunk, just as I won't drive stoned. If someone wants to put themselves at danger, that's on them and they will at one point soon be arrested, and charged  appropriately (the average drunk driver drives drunk 87 times before being pulled over).
Normal adults (read: responsible individuals) will not drive after any amount of substance impairs their motor ability, and even when someone is stoned off their ass, I would trust their driving over a drunk any day.
Also, for sake of comparison, after alcohol prohibition ended, consumption dropped off substantially. The reasoning for this is commonly attributed to the fact that people no longer had to hide what they were doing. During prohibition, people got completely wasted because they didn't know the next time they would be able to get drunk. After prohibition ended, people all of a sudden realized "oh, I can go down to the corner store and get a six pack for Friday night." Ease of access can, and I believe will decrease use and abuse because people will be able to hold onto larger quantities without being pegged as a dealer by the police. 
If I had multiple ounces sitting on top of my dresser, with no fear of arrest, I wouldn't have any problem with it staying there. If I have one joint, containing 0.5 g of weed, I run the risk of being arrested, and having no stable job later on, so it has to be disposed of immediately. Just like the difference between living on campus and off in college. I can now have gallons upon gallons of alcohol sitting in the open, however on campus, having a shot glass could almost get someone in trouble, so the more alcohol someone bought, the quicker they would have to consume more quantities of liquor, beer, etc.
consumption would drop off, people wouldn't feel the need to abuse it so often, and would overall be much safer.
This is another thing. I can't drive sober actually. I am constantly on the 30. On the 45. On the 70. Always pushing the limit 5. Always cutting people off. Always turning left at busy intersections with no light.
When I'm high I will literally go out of my way from Taco Bell to get to the light so I don't have to make that intersection turn. I will go 25 the whole way home. I realize we drive like retards and endanger our lives.
We have a railroad that was built last year. They had signs up pushing people into one lane. Well at night one night i'm crossing it on delivery. It's pitch black from no lights up yet, and slippery is shit in my rear wheel drive manual car. I was seconds from impaling my car on a steel pole going 45 before I swerved and spun tires around it going out.
This feeling felt familiar, Where from? How quickly I can dodge things high in online games.
 As I sit here now I am sober, it's 5:30am and I can't sleep. my cheeks are sore, I'm speed typing. Constantly chattering teeth, chewing my fingers and cheeks. To some people ganja actually makes us live our lives better. My favorite part is this doesn't bother me. I'm staying sober because i'm better with girls whom i'm meeting soon. (ganja chills me out to much to make moves) People who drink to quell certain problems can't live without it. The return of the sober chattering restless mind would destroy them.
I wanted to learn how to do this, and now I do, all the time! Here's what we do:
1. My boyfriend goes down on me (the best way for me to get aroused) for a while - long enough for me to get super wet and turned on.
2. When I feel like I'm getting pretty close to orgasm, I pull up on his shoulders, the signal for him to start fucking me. (He puts a condom on before we start, so this transition can happen very quickly.)
3. We start fucking while I rub my clit. (If you're going to do this, I strongly recommend that you experiment to figure out which kind of stroke/thrust works best for you, so you can tell your man what to do. I like deep strokes and a lot of G-spot rubbing, for example.)
4. If I start to lose my arousal, or if he starts to feel like he's going to come too soon, he goes down on me some more, and then comes back up.
5. I continue rubbing my clit until I reach orgasm.
6. He keeps going until he finishes. (I looove this part, because orgasm makes my G-spot so deliciously sensitive!)
I will warn you that it takes practice to be able to feel his thrusting as a *contribution* to your orgasm, rather than a distraction from it. I've been masturbating to orgasm regularly for 10+ years, and have used dildos for a lot of that time, and it *still* took me at least 5-10 tries before the penis action started feeling *good* rather than distracting. Don't give up!!
** Have him use his mouth and/or hands to get you close to orgasm, then masturbate the way you normally do while he penetrates you. It will take practice to get this to feel natural and easy, but it's worth putting time and energy into!**
I disagree about which season was better. I've watched both seasons twice, and I liked the second one much more. I commented already about the romance plots in the first and second seasons. Think about how simple the first romance was for instance. [Keima used giant signs and banners to show support for her for days, then saw through her fake injury and encouraged her again. Bam - love. Wait, what?](/spoiler)
Compared to the Chihiro arc where [I had trouble summarizing this actually, so I'll just paste part of Wikipedia's episode summary: Chihiro confesses she started liking Keima since they're both similar of being disappointed with the real world. However, he corrects her that despite his dislike with the real world, he never given up on himself so she should do the same thing. But when Chihiro tries protest that someone as average as her can never be special, Keima kisses her by surprise and tells her as long as she truly wants it, nothing can stop her from becoming special, which forces the spirit out. With the spirit gone, Chihiro becomes more cheerful, confident and tells Elsie they should start a rock band.](/spoiler) [link](
romances more involved and believable. Also the plot begins to develop past "make girls fall in love with you and get runaway spirits".
I think you probably liked the first season more because it hadn't lost any of its novelty yet. The second season was very similar, just better development.
OneY here, and I'm calling bullshit on this whole notion. The only people I have heard of that hold these opinions are the whack-jobs in the media that spout out this nonsense.
In my opinion, the much publicized "war on women" (all over USA media) from the right wing has brought these **minority** opinions to the forefront of everyone's mind, especially in the minds of women, it would seem to me.
*** The people that agree with this image are also the ones making asses of themselves on Fox News.
God forbid you get another perspective and break free from your little "eliptischlick" that you have going on here.  
For the 100th fucking time, my original post had NOTHING to do with me being male, NOTHING.  It could have come from a female and had the same weight and affect.  YOU and your femsquad turned it into an issue.    And don't give me any more "woe is me" bullshit, rare subreddit?  Look at your damn sidebar, come on.  
&gt;a subreddit where discussion can finally be all about the female perspective, for once on this website, and start demanding that everybody considers the men?  
Wow, if this isnt the most whiney, pathetic attempt at gathering some sympathy.  Look, first off  it's THE FUCKING INTERNET you dipshit.  If you get butthurt by any little thing like, someone presenting a perspective you don't like then perhaps you should reevaluate the amount of time you spend here.  You and i can go to any website we please if you think this subreddit is pure female and ONLY for a female perspective your are deluded.  Reddit is 72% male, you are GOING to have some cross over, get used to it.  We have females in ALL the male subreddits and we seem to handle it just fine without flipping our shit.  Im sure you will learn to do the same.   "LIFEZ SO HRD AMIRITE LADEEZ? NO1 UNDRSTANDZ OUR PROBLMZ WE ARE ALL TINY LITL SNOW FLAKZ!!  NO ONE GETS IT OR EVER CULD! AMIRITE LADEEEEZ?"  shit like this picture only perpetuate a stereotype. Females can be whoever the fuck they want to be, if you want to pigeon hole yourself into these catagories then be my guest.  But don't give me shit that males don't face similar problems albeit called different words.  my wife saw this post and said "welp, thats total bullshit".
&gt; for once on this website  
LOL!!!  Drama.   
&gt;and start demanding that everybody considers the men?  
I dont recall demanding anything.  And it was a male perspective btw.  Lots of females felt the same way, i responded to numerous of them on here.  So clearly it is also a female perspective as well.    Btw you are fully welcome to ignore any "demands" thats what the downvote button is for.  Instead of whining about how you want to keep your little "clubs" integrity just fucking downvote.  

You'll live, get over it.  Your precious girl-club isn't only full of girls.  
Oh and you arent gonna change how i feel about it, but please type your cute little heart out and just hope for the best.  
Your data is mostly correct.  The maximum power a USB2.0 port can supply is 5 units of power (a unit in the USB spec is 100mA) or 500mA.  This is also only after negotiation when the device lets the host know that it is a high power device (500mA vs 100mA).
Now there is a new stipulation to the spec called USB charging.  If a port supports charging, it won't cap the current draw.  However, the cables are rated for 1.5A.
All that said, I still don't see the purpose for this little inline device.  If you plug your iPad into a charging port it will get the power it wants, and if you plug it into a classic port there is no way it will get more than 500mA.
 it's a scam.
I haven't been on steam in a while, and haven't heard of your game until now. Good news: I'm going to look it up and see what it's all about. If it's a genre I enjoy then I'll buy it. If it's not a genre I typically play, I'll still buy it anyway. 
There is no way in hell I'm not supporting a company backed by people like yourself. Stick with it and never forget the appreciation your community will have for you in a gaming landscape such as this. 
Many companies are getting shitty and treading on us gamers. Thanks for being different. 
- I have no idea what this game is, but I'm buying it anyway. Jump on board and let's watch a company that deserves it flourish. 
&gt; Maybe not a lecture about friendship, but maybe something along the lines of, "I am Motherf*cking Commander Shepard and I just brokered peace in a centuries long conflict between Synthetics and Organics. Don't tell me that Synthetics will always wipe out Organics!"
He acknowledges that, but believes this peace won't last. Do you actually think Shepard can change the Catalyst's mind about it to avoid sacrificing himself?
&gt; I am not arguing over the color of the beams here. Control is seen as the Paragon option where everyone lives, including the Reapers; yet somehow scumbag TIM, whose methods would make even Hitler look sane, represents this ending? Then Anderson, who repeatedly argues that the ends don't justify the means if millions have to die in the process (look at his arguments against Saren in ME1), represents the ending where you annihilate all Synthetic life in the universe?
The difference is the motivation behind. Control+TIM is evil because he wanted to use it to make humans the rulers of the Galaxy. Destroy+Anderson is good because he wanted to save the universe from the Reapers.
As I mentioned before, in practical terms Control means sacrificing your life to save synthetic life, and Destroy means sacrificing synthetics for a *chance* to live. Self-sacrifice is paragon, destroying a whole species is Renegade.
&gt; As for traveling at 200x the speed of light, that was only when traveling through a Mass Relay. Otherwise, ME ships are limited to traveling at speeds slightly faster than the speed of light.
Nope.
["To an outside observer, a ship within a mass effect drive envelope appears to have blue-shifted. If within a field that allows travel at twice the speed of light, any radiation it emits has twice the energy as normal. If the ship is in a field of about **200 times lightspeed**, it radiates visible light as x-rays and gamma rays, and the infrared heat from the hull is blue-shifted up into the visible spectrum or higher.

This to me is one of the biggest problems with LoL. There are too many champions coming out too quickly. This caters to the people who are die hard LoL players, and not at all to those of us who only play a couple of times a week. This is in NO way a casual game, and that is so bittersweet. It is impossible to come back after a week of not playing when a new champ has been released, bc i can guarantee that someone int he game will pick that champ, and I will have no idea how to counter that champ.
too many champs make it too difficult to be good at the game without investing huge amounts of time 
I think Riot know what they are doing
Proof : This whole AMAZING game
Let them create their game at the pace they want and stop doubting them.  They never disappointed me (so far) in almost two years and since i'm playing people complain about what they are doing and about how they are doing some things.  
People want a new map so bad.  Dominion is not even 1 year old and most of people I know didn't played it in month, it's gonna be the same with MagmaC. (please refer to : the TT syndrome)
People want more balance.  In the forum you see people complaining on tweaks and adjustments in every Patch Notes.
And if Riot dares to do important change (new jungle, masteries, re-work) A huge part of the community's going to complain about how things were better back then !  If riot would listen to all those posts on this subreddit or on the forum, they would be clueless about what to do. 
: Gamers : just game please, don't try to look like you could run this business.

I had to re-read your original post to get what you're getting at, but I think it's this: "eating meat is the default behavior of humans, so we should not blame people too harshly when some refuse to go against what feels right and natural to them." Is that right?
If it is,
Humans may have natural tendencies (such as finding meat tasty), but of course also possess higher-level executive function that allow us to override instinct. A great deal of the reptilian brain is designed to avoid falling off of cliffs and other high places, but people can still skydive knowing they are relatively safe. Disregarding mental retardation, eating meat while aware of the suffering is still a deliberate action.
Natural-born killers do exist, and they get enjoyment from killing. Fighting and killing are great ways to get what you want, and those that got a rush from these activities were more likely than purely passive individuals to pass on their genes (see: Genghis Khan). In modern society, it is difficult for these people to adapt to not killing people, and I agree that our criticisms will not change what's in their blood. However, that doesn't mean we should simply accept that they can kill whomever they please.
If someone deliberately and continuously inflicts suffering on others, what does it matter that it is in their nature? If their actions were against humans, they would be executed or imprisoned.

As Mxero has stated, only the original buyers lost money. But what people haven't stated is what refined costs on the market at the moment. It seems to fluctuate from about 48c-60c roughly. So for 3 refined it's about $1.50. As everyone knows keys are about 2.44-2.55 refined. So you're making .22 refined per key sold, and if sold in large quantities like everyone is, you're making keys a day. I've studied the market on selling and buy keys and refined and it's pretty damn brilliant.
3 Refined is 1.50 sell a key(2.44) for 1.50 ??? profit 
the problem right now is the fact that the game can be played by anyone, because it is free and appeals to the casual gamer all the way up to the professionals. Since there is this huge clash of people with different mentalities people are going to whine and complain in the early to mid level range.
  league can be played by anyone with a computer but not everyone can play well with others
solution: find three other people to play with so you don't have to worry about random pugs.  
So, I had to drive a friend to an airport in a different city reeeaal early in the morning, and the same damn thing happened with my iPod. Obviously we Blaze Nationed beforehand, and set out while it was still dark. I turn on my iPod and it starts playing the chillest tunes I had, but as the sun came up the songs chosen became progressively more epic until, sure enough, right as the sun hits, Fuck Buttons starts playing (if you're unfamiliar, enjoy:  ). Most excellently epic, right? As the trip progresses and the day gets brighter, the music gets faster and more metal, keeping me awake on the ride home...SkyNet is here.
Same thing happened to me on a drive through an epic sunrise.
I carry Sabre defense spray when I'm going out for walks. It's small and attatches to my key chain but when I'm out I have it detatched. I didn't use to carry anything but when I walk I don't always stay to the gentrified areas. It may not have the stopping power of a gun or taser but in my area your biggest concern is generally being an easy target. I don't look like an easy target and if someone or a gang of people approach me a circular spray would likely deter most of them or at least make the numbers more even. At the very least it will stall and give me time to get away and can't be used against me to kill me. 
 I use a multi-defense spray because it's cheap, easy to use, and small enough to EDC.
Hi r/funny. Let me explain karmac's comment. FOV means field of view. Basically, it means the angle that you can see at once without moving your head.
A human being has a huge field of vision, something like 120-180 degrees (it depends on your definitions). You can see stuff in your peripheral vision that is basically at a right angle to the direction you are looking.
But if you tried to stuff a humans' entire field of vision into a single flat monitor, it'd look all warped around the edges, like a Mercator projection. Most FPS use a field of view of around 75-90, and much less in the vertical direction. That's why you don't see the whole arm when you play a FPS. In real life, it would be in your peripheral vision. But your peripheral vision is cut off in the game.
So that guy in the first pic is not holding the gun up to his face. he's holding his arm outstretched, but the arm is cut off by the narrow field of vision.
 OP is a moron.
&gt;The fact that your insurance company has coverage with a doctor means that they negotiated a tolerable price with the doctor. There is a reason they don't offer coverage with all of the physicians.
Did you read the article?  At all?  Here are a few quotes that prove you wrong:  
"The result is that, unlike in other countries, sellers of health-care services in America have considerable power to set prices, and so they set them quite high. Two of the five most profitable industries in the United States — the pharmaceuticals industry and the medical device industry — sell health care. With margins of almost 20 percent, they beat out even the financial sector for sheer profitability."
"The players sitting across the table from them — the health insurers — are not so profitable. In 2009, their profit margins were a mere 2.2 percent. That’s a signal that the sellers have the upper hand over the buyers."
"In America, Medicare and Medicaid negotiate prices on behalf of their tens of millions of members and, not coincidentally, purchase care at a substantial markdown from the commercial average. But outside that, it’s a free-for-all. Providers largely charge what they can get away with, often offering different prices to different insurers, and an even higher price to the uninsured."
"“Other countries negotiate very aggressively with the providers and set rates that are much lower than we do,” Anderson says. They do this in one of two ways. In countries such as Canada and Britain, prices are set by the government. In others, such as Germany and Japan, they’re set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement, with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail."
 Your assertion that they negotiate tolerable prices with the doctor is not true, in any way, according to the very article that this thread is about.  You should read it.
&gt;It's not about efficiency or cost of services, it's about convenience.
It absolutely is not.  You have the option of buying various different types of food, of various qualities, from various different outlets.  Since you have numerous outlets, and the ability to stock pile, and can choose from an abundance of sources, the food industry is not even CLOSE to the same as the health care industry.  You can't stock pile health care.  In general, you have limited options as to where you receive it, and the way insurance and billing works completely distorts how individuals choose their service providers.
It's not even CLOSE to the same thing.
This reminds me of Pizarro's conquest of the Incas, who were then governed by an emperor named Atahuallpa. This powerful passage from the book Guns, Germs, and Steel says a lot:
&gt;“Atahuallpa asked for the Book, that he might look at it, and the Friar gave it to him closed. Atahuallpa did not know how to open the Book, and the Friar was extending his arm to do so, when Atahuallpa, in great anger, gave him a blow on the arm, not wishing that it should be opened. Then he opened it himself, and, without any astonishment at the letters and paper he threw it away from him five or six paces, his face a deep crimson. “The Friar returned to Pizarro, shouting, ‘Come out! Come out, Christians! Come at these enemy dogs who reject the things of God. That tyrant has thrown my book of holy law to the ground! Did you not see what happened? Why remain polite and servile toward this over-proud dog when the plains are full of Indians? March out against him, for I absolve you!’
... after this, Pizarro's troops massacred "all but a few" of the 40,000 frightened Indians (the emperor himself admitted at least 7,000 died).
At the end of the battle ...

&gt;Atahuallpa's robes had been torn off when the Spaniards pulled him out of his litter. The Governor ordered clothes to be brought to him, and when Atahuallpa was dressed, the Governor ordered Atahuallpa to sit near him and soothed his rage and agitation at finding himself so quickly fallen from his high estate. The Governor said to Atahuallpa, ‘Do not take it as an insult that you have been defeated and taken prisoner, for with the Christians who come with me, though so few in number, I have conquered greater kingdoms than yours, and have defeated other more powerful lords than you, imposing upon them the dominion of the Emperor, whose vassal I am, and who is King of Spain and of the universal world. We come to conquer this land by his command, that all may come to a knowledge of God and of His Holy Catholic Faith; and by reason of our good mission, God, the Creator of heaven and earth and of all things in them, permits this, in order that you may know Him and come out from the bestial and diabolical life that you lead. It is for this reason that we, being so few in number, subjugate that vast host. When you have seen the errors in which you live, you will understand the good that we have done you by coming to your land by order of his Majesty the King of Spain. Our Lord permitted that your pride should be brought low and that no Indian should be able to offend a Christian.’”

*** Pizarro killed anywhere between 7,000 and 40,000 people in modern day Peru and justified his victory by telling them that their loss was so that they could know God better.
It is exactly what the advertises, mate. 
A friend of mine went on the most racist drunken rant I've ever heard, 
"Asians, Cork Asians and Black Asians are your starting races. Now you've got like, modifiers for everyone, cause everyone has modifiers. BUT NOT US. But everyone else. So it's like, Asians get plus three to work. Like, all work, but homework mostly. They understand things. They also get plus one to fighting, because of like, yakuza and shit, yo. But every upside has a downside, right, so they get minus three to dicks. Which sucks. I mean, some asians are stupid with massive dicks, but that's from like, training, you know, and getting +1 to ghetto and shit.
Now, your black person gets natural plus three to fighting, and plus two to badass. They also get a plus three to dicks. But because they're like, always oppressed and shit, they get minus three to intelligence. I'm not racist, right, but they just get less schools and don't get the same schooling as asians. But I'm not racist, you know, because they're not stupid, but they're just not smart. But like, because of society, so it's not racist to say it. 
And white guys don't get any of that. We're just like, the standard race, with no bonuses. Except like, plus three to racism, because we're just *cunts*. With minus three dicks versus black dudes."
***: Real life D&amp;D Racial Stats: *Asian*: +3 homework, +1 fighting, -3 dicks. *Black*: +3 dicks, +3 fighting, +2 Badass, -3 Homework, *White*: +3 Racism
so is assuming you can project your own values and ideals onto other cultures but I suppose there's nothing I could do about that. The main issue here is that her Asian upbringing is conflicting with the kid's (presumably) American sociocultural values. I'm going to refer to Asians as specifically the Chinese because I can't speak for any other Asian cultures from experience. Whereas Asians value discipline and familial piety Americans value expression and independence.
Asian parents pull this shit because they believe it will encourage their child to do the best.  Although many might say otherwise, I don't think Asian parents actually expect perfection so much as they expect you to strive for it. Typically ABCs understand this and are resilient to the perceived "harshness" of the upbringing and end up better than do western kids raised in similar environments. However, I feel that recently the reception to this parenting style has taken a turn for the worse due to a much larger negative social stigma attached to the authoritarian style of parenting resulting in Asian children taking their parenting in a manner similar to western children. Thus it would seem that "fighting back" just increases problems for the kids while simultaneously depressing the parents. So while white-knighting them is admirable, it's really not helping anything during development.
In the end, the only thing you can really do in a western country is wait for these generations of discontent to pass and for the "suppressed" children to become parents themselves and slowly adjust generation by generation until all of the Authoritarian Asian parenting is kicked out of them. I have a couple of 3rd generation friends that this has already happened to and they're as whitewashed as you can get.
I posted pretty much the same thing in the same thread [here](
As a ABC myself I think Asian parenting is harsh but legit. But none of you are going to agree because YAY CULTURAL AWARENESS.
I personally am of the opinion that since Christianity already asserted that Jesus was born of a virgin, that Muslims interpreted the scripture describing the birth of Jesus in the same manner. But technically, according to the verses, when Mary was visited by the messenger, she asserted that she was virgin and chaste. The messenger tells her "don't worry about it, if Allah wants it to happen, it'll happen" (I'm paraphrasing, of course :P). There is nothing that mentions that she was *still* in that state of chastity by the time the birth actually happened. Yes, she was a virgin... right up until it was time for making a baby.
So here's my take (gonna soo get told I'm blaspheming here or something but whatevs): Mary was a chaste and godly woman. There is no way she'd have relations outside of marriage. However, Allah wanted her to have the child. So he told her ahead of time... look, there's going to be a child coming pretty soon. You're having it. She protests because she is not married or unchaste - everything she's been told tells her that this can't happen without her committing some grievous sin. She's basically being comforted and reassured that when the time comes, do not despair that you have gone against the will of God because this child IS the will of God, so do what you have to do and know that you're doing the right thing here.
 I believe Jesus, son of Mary is also the biological son of Joseph. Nothing is impossible for Allah, but he's created the ways for things to happen - he doesn't wave magic wands and -BOOM- A Baby! He works through people to bring about what he wants to happen. And for a baby to happen, two people have to get together and get busy. Us wanting it to be magical or pretend that Mary, the perfect woman, is one that never had sex doesn't mean it's true. So... yeah. Just offering a different possible perspective on it. Fairly sure nobody here would agree with that interpretation, because everyone has been taught that Jesus was born of a virgin. But virgins don't have children.
Back when I was in college I used to draw quite a lot of larger (aka fat) women (Hey, it's my thing) and hid them in my drawers and often would scan them onto my laptop to put on to Deviantart. Well very stupidly I left one of these drawings in the printer/scanner before leaving for college. When I came home next my family mentioned it but werent even mad, in fact they thought it was perfectly normal but couldnt resist poking a little fun.
** Family found my drawings of fat chicks and were totally cool about it.**

Was still embarassing as hell though.
GET A LAWYER!!!
This happened to me in Owosso, MI about 10 years ago. My dog was about 10 yards off my property into the street and a family living 1/2 mile down the street called in a complaint. I had never met the family before. Everyone in the neighborhood loved my dog. The dog is a collie, and the most mild mannered loving dog on the planet. The officer who responded to the complaint was baffled that anyone would call in a complaint on the dog. But he was bound by procedures to write the ticket. I had an appearance date to plead non-guilty or guilty, I plead guilty in front of a judge (ticketing officer told me it was just a $100 fine!!!), met with a sentencing interviewer, and then was sentenced to a 90 day suspended jail time and $500 fine.
** GET A LAWYER!!!**
Well in some cases. For example I once was parked outside a friends house and didnt have a "PARKING PERMIT". Even though I did It was just facing the wrong way. So the towing company were straight up douchebags and didnt give a fuck a towed it away. I went to claim it at the lot and they're saying some bullshit about it being there job and staight assholes the whole time. I called the cops and everything they said they couldnt help. So I had to pay $130 sure enough I went to the bank and changed $130 in to pennys. They gave them to me in these neat organized rolls but fuck that I opened them sunsofbitches and poured them into a McDonalds bag. They gave me the meanest looks and said they couldn't accept it. Luckily the cop who was still there said it was U.S legal tender and they had to take it. Sure enough My car hasnt been towed since.
 Car Towed payed with pennies.  
I had a similar thing in which the man refused to accept state quarters because they "weren't real" I then had to stand there and wait 40 fucking minutes for a police officer to show up and tell him that they were indeed real money and if he refused to accept them I didn't have to pay at all and the dude then refused to accept them and the officer went to his car got the owner of the restaurant on the phone and got the man fired immediately then the managers new temporary replacement took the money and I laughed at the dumbass who got canned.
Dumbass got fired for refusing to accept state quarters as part of my payment.
i don't know about the US but in some countries you can refuse accepting payments beyond a certain amount in coins.
like say the debt is "Currency" 100.
and the payer decided to pay the amount in coins of value "Currency" 0.25
The limit for payment in that country is "currency" 25.
The payee can refuse accepting the payment  beyond "currency" 25.Which does not tantamount to clearance of debt.
but that is the legal front. i don't think anybody would do that unless its a huge number of coins.
- certain countires have limit on the amount of coins/value, beyond which payee can refuse accepting payment and the debt is not cleared.
Perhaps they had felt as though they'd been "proven wrong" on the matter of whether or not they could make it on their own, and that factored into the end of the war. But even if they had strongly wanted to continue fighting, they wouldn't have had the capability.
In any case, I personally don't favor secession as an arbitrary right to be exercised at the will of the holder; it simply isn't the best or simplest solution is most cases. I do believe in certain and extremely dire circumstances, it could be appropriate or even necessary. 
TLDR it just depends in my opinion, I don't think it should be totally ruled out or committed to from a general standpoint.
I'm totally with you. I'm a pretty ardent pacifist, so i'm wildly biased. The heroic notion is that they're doing something for other people, but really I don't see heroism as a career- especially one you get paid for (though people can rise above.., but that's not for here).
I love these videos because they show people reuniting with loved ones and those loved ones (at least temporarily) are not being involved in war. If I could find Nazi welcome home videos, I'd watch those because I bet they're amazing. Those people had MUCH less of a chance of coming home alive or without being severely maimed and little to no contact with loved ones. 
 nazi/wwII welcome home videos would be amazing.
Well technically its been a response to ocular irritation where the lacrimal apparatus sheds tears to try and wash away the irritant, however it has been shown that there is a link between the emotional centres of the brain and this part of the eye which goes part of the way to explain it.
Fun Fact: Tears released from and emotional response have a significantly different hormonal composition to tears released otherwise and this may provide some other signal to other humans.
Stop being a cunt people get emotional.
The triathlon is an interesting beast because its primarily a bike and run race with a swim at the front.  The swim doesn't matter, but it *does* matter, because a great swimmer who's just ok at the other events can't win, but a horrible swimmer who's great at the other two events probably won't beat the former guy.  This is because swimming is so incredibly technique dependent that compared to the other two sports, poor form requires an exponentially increased level of effort to deal with.  
That being said, I am doing what you are saying above: I am doing a 70.3 at the end of June with around 3 months training and 2 months after a marathon.  But a few caveats.  
1)  I swam competitively for 10 years.  I plan on doing the swim in less then 30 minutes, it doesn't intimidate me, in fact I will train very little for the swim.
2) I was a cyclist for longer than I swam, albeit not as seriously, but pretty damn seriously.  
3) I started running 5 years ago and have been doing min. 500 miles a year since then, gradually increasing skill and endurance the entire time.  
So, in summary.  I am decent at best at all 3 events already, with the run being my weakest by far.  
My suggestion after reading further in the thread is that you get swimming lessons and focus at least 50% of your training on swimming.  You don't need to expect huge gains in speed - if you can get down to 50 minutes total for your 1.2 you should be fine - but you want to get *efficient* so that you don't get out of the water with 6 hours of triathlon left and have spent your tank already.   I think this is doable for you but you really need to be comfortable with the swim.  Especially in the open water (it is a way way different ball game when you need to spot buoys). 
  Bang for your buck is to take swimming lessons, take them seriously and practice practice practice.  
 
Not only that, but there seems to be a greater difference between the amount the player is slowed and the amount that the player is slowed.
With the in-game slow time shout, the environment is (for the sake of example) slowed by a factor of 100 while the player is slowed by a factor of 10.
In this new spell, the environment is slowed by a factor of 1000 while the player is still only slowed by a factor of 10.
This means you can do cool stuff like dodge arrows, run circles around everyone while they are relatively motionless.
 mod spell is matrix mode while the vanilla shout is everyone is in molasses mode.
It's a jag bridge with graphite saddles, originals came with me. The guard is a warmoth for hh. The pickups are non original jbs from Duncan unfortunately. They sound nice. It's said to be a refinish but I really don't know. It appears to me(after taking it apart) to be its true color. At least, if not that, it's been this way for a while. Starting to crack etc. I posted some cool shots of the neck and pots over in the other thread. I really enjoy it and don't see myself selling it. It did however need a new jack. Switchcraft is on the way. 
Does a refret hurt its value?

it plays phenomenally and is everything I've ever wanted.
English is the official language of USA, a nation which is probably built-up entirely by immigrants from different roots, like Canada and Australia. English happens to be the national language, that's true.
However, immigration has occurred since then, and it's a phenomenon which cannot be predicted with precision. Nor we cannot narrow the reason for the immigrants leave their country. Some are cult, some are not; some need the language in their daily tasks, some perhaps not.
In addition, something particular, USA is one of countries with the biggest amount of Spanish speakers in the whole world; this fact cannot be ignored. Sure, if they learn the national language (in this case English), they'll have more chances. But also, nowadays Economy and Politics seem to be more important than Society, and Hispanics are counting votes and counting dollars...
** Speaking Spanish in USA is not incorrect nor invalid**
Best not to wash them unless they're stained, and if they are.... well I'd honestly advise you to just toss them and call it a loss. Like user "HenkieVV" already said, 90% of the time washing a tie will ruin it. In terms of cleanliness, again I wouldn't worry about it being an issue, as ties for the most part are clean.
*** Washing will likely ruin them, so you're better off just using them as is. If they're dirty, toss them.
I told my girlfriend about my non-beliefs, and how i don't need to see fairies in the garden for the garden to be a beautiful place. I'll go with her to church when its convenient, visiting parents, or just to show my respect and support. 
There are some Catholics out there that aren't super religious, they keep the faith because the traditions give them a framework to live in. Kinda like secular Jews. 
I ended up marrying this woman; I'm very happy and I think she is too.
 make sure the sex is good
Haha the concept was a complete joke. I can't remember the full story but the developer Matt Harding wanted to make a more family friendly game and got shot down because the higher ups wanted more action. In response he came up with the stupidest idea ever and submitted a game idea simply called 'Destroy All Humans'. The project got greenlit and in frustration Matt quit and wandered the world before becoming known for video compilations of him performing a dance at various landmarks.
Destroy All Humans was a joke made by Matt from 'Where the Hell is Matt?"
I'm going to answer this as best I can, but to do so I need to have a minor rant.  Involuntary and hard wired are not similar concepts.  Involuntary just means "happens before or beneath conscious awareness."  There are lots of involuntary and automatic behaviors that are learned.  Most skills for example begin as conscious motor programs, and eventually become smooth, automatic sequences of movements.  Many phobias or other strong emotional responses are examples of involuntary learned reactions (c.f. [Little Albert](  
Racial prejudice certainly has involuntary aspects, emotional and behavioral biases that happen without explicit awareness.  There are even some neat tests you can take (the [implicit association test]( being a good one with lots of examples and research on it), to measure such implicit biases for lots of different groups, race, sex, religion, george bush etc.  These biases can be hugely consequential, with perhaps the most frightening and pertinent to current events example being the implicit association most people have between [african-americans and firearms]( --[related study done with police officers](
Ok, so that's involuntary stuff, yes definitely there is some involuntary aspects to prejudice.  But the phrase "hard wired" is different, and really sticks in my craw.  This is a phrase that needs to die.  To me hard wired implies "unlearned" and "unmodifiable."  **Nothing in the brain is unlearned or unmodifiable.** Indeed, the brain is the exact opposite of that.  Every single synapse, in every single region of the brain is plastic.  The pain neurons in your spinal chord can [potentiate]( (i.e. become more strongly responsive in response to learned pain signals).  Before you were born, before you ever used your eyes, your primary visual cortex was being set up in part *based on feedback from photoreceptors* (which at that point was mostly noise, but it's useful for setting up a self-organizing connectivity map) It is never meaningful to talk about something being hard wired.  The brain isn't wired, it is plastic, it is endlessly remappable.  Hard wired is exactly the opposite of the correct analogy to use.  
Now that's not to say it's not possible to imagine that some aspects of the nervous system (including high-level stuff like prejudice), might have a bias toward being set up in a certain way.  At a very early age we can observe ingroup/outgroup effects (Note: Many studies, especially by Renee Baillergon, but all behind pay walls because the infant-cognition journals suck). 
However, calling this "hard wired" is wrong because A) they can unlearn it later just fine.  and B) the observation of such a bias, even in very young children is not strong evidence for a genetic cause.  Like everything in psychology, this behavior is caused by multiple factors, none of which can be removed.  By the time a kid is able to hold their head up strongly enough to participate in an experiment they've had hundreds of hours of experience in social situations (children and baby monkeys reared without social contact die, not merely from starvation, but actually from isolation.  see Harry Harlowe).  Every thought and every behavior and every brain wiring is a result of an endless chain of feedback and interaction between biological systems, previous memory, and the outside world.  Proposing something that is "hard wired" and leaps over this feedback requires an experiment in which all non-hardwired effects have been removed, and that's simply not possible.  That makes true hard-wiring theories unfalsifiable, and not a good starting place for research.  
*** Involuntary--you bet. Hard wired: remove this phrase from your lexicon, and stab anyone who uses it in the eye before they can do more harm.
I once dated a woman during college when I was 21, she was 23.
We had been dating for a couple of months, using protection, etc, and we begin to discuss ditching the latex for other forms of b.c.  At this point in the relationship, I thought I would volunteer my sexual partner count to increase the amount of trust between us to aid in the decision making process.
She received the information when I volunteered it, and when I asked for it in return she promptly denied me.  I was a little put off, and being the stubborn guy I am, I pressed her until she told me a few days later.  Turns out she had well over 50 partners, and the worst part was, there was a +/- factor of 5 she threw in, because she just didn't know (multiple partner situations, being blacked out, a few women).  I'm all for the concept of sex as a form of empowerent for women, but her experiences were based around substance abuse, and what she described as a series of bad decisions when she was younger.
I don't think something so trivial as a number should matter, but when I heard that from her, a part of my feelings toward her changed for the worse.  
**** If there is a *huge* disparity, it can cause conflict or stress in a relationship due to a difference in past experiences or attitudes towards self respect.

I like your point, and yes in a majority of cases you may be correct.
However, in my experience, I have gone out with girls who have had sex with between 0-3 guys, and they still cheat.
Also lots of guys and girls I know just change and become 'sluttier' later in life.
 the number of sexual partners a person has had does not predicate a persons trustworthyness in a relationship.
When I was younger this bothered me, I even sought out partners that I knew weren't that experienced. Later in life as I grew in confidence I realised how ridiculous it was. Two of the greatest relationships I've had in my life were with girls who'd had over 30 partners before me. I know from my own experience that sex has been unique with almost everyone I have ever been with.
There is one thing though I have said to anyone I have ever been with, that it is only a problem with me if having sex with those people was a problem with them. We should be able to enjoy sex, if you have 5 partners and felt guilty or wrong about them and how it happened, then that is a problem. If you had 20 and they were great experiences, then it's a wonderful thing. And it's not a problem I would ever have with them, but they should think about why it happened.
the reason's behind and how the sex happened make a problem, but they should never be a problem for you.
Honestly, there's a huge difference between 0 partners and 1 partner, but absolutely no difference between 1 partner and 300 partners (provided no diseases were acquired). 
I only distinguish between virgins and non-virgins as well as STD clean or STD not clean
You should let this little teeny tiny fact fester in your pea-brain until you can't stand it anymore.  Then you should go fuck some truly skank whores to bump your number.  As your relationship continues and she treats you like a king, then you can start to feel like the miserable fuck you are, and in a moment of weakness, confess your deeds, and beg for forgiveness.  When she leaves you, and after months of depression, you can finally come back here and admit what a tremendous douche bag you were to let something so trivial ruin the greatest relationship you ever had.  
 go ahead and wreck it, there's a more deserving guy around the corner.  
Dude, I know you probably won't even read this, but here goes.
Yeah, it matters to me. And yeah, my number has mattered to girls in the past. It's one of those things that fucks with ya - you know it's illogical and you wish you didn't feel it, but you do. Don't let the people here call you a pussy, or pathetic, or tell you to man up, or whatever. They're lucky enough to have never experienced what you feel. They're basically saying "Doesn't matter how you feel, this is how society says you should feel, go acquiesce completely to what your girl and peers want..." You don't have to. You're justified in feeling that way, if it's how you feel. Acknowledging that your relationship makes you feel like shit shouldn't be a sign of weakness. It doesn't mean you disrespect your girlfriend. It means you've chose to live a different lifestyle and subscribed to different philosophies than she has, so (with no one being at fault or made to feel belittled or shamed or called a pussy) it's not working out. *People have different sexual ethics*. People should be open-minded about sex. Sure. That means we don't have to accept other people's sexual ethics as are own, and that we shouldn't be shamed for expressing our own just because they're not popular. Everything has two sides. It's totally acceptable for both women and men to be attracted to whoever they like and to explore their sexuality to find what makes them happy. This is the basis of healthy sexual philosophy. So, take advantage of this mentality - If something sexual makes you uncomfortable, you don't have to be involved in it, and you can't be attacked for it. End of story.
 Everyone is free to make their own choices regarding sex. If your partner's philosophy makes you uncomfortable, you're not disrespecting her by standing up for yourself.
Late to the game, but here I go! 
I wish it didn't matter to me, I don't want it to, but I do believe my little green monster would not respect my wishes. 
Even with that being said, I think it does matter to an extent. The numbers are a crude reflection of some part of sexual chemistry between the two people involved. Someone with a much higher number of partners probably wouldn't be a great match for me. I like relationships. I like lots of sex, but not lots of sex with lots of people. Although, it's important to me to be with someone who knows when to let go and just go with the feelings of the night and enjoy yourself and who you're with. So, hook up randomly sometimes, mostly keep it to relationships. On the other hand, someone with few past partners probably reflects a person I wouldn't click with either. Too conservative. Gotta be able to let go!
Someone who's past amount of partners/hookups reflects a similar lifestyle probably would be a good match. AKA yes, I think the number matters. Just another area for couples to have similarities to be discovered. 

Lecture attendance - a warning
Posted on: Monday, 27 February 2012
Dear Students
I am getting many emails from students who failed to attend one or more lectures and are now asking me for the lecture notes.   I would thus like to once more clarify the ground rules as discussed in the first lecture and several times since:
1) I am happy to let you have the lecture notes and to help you catch up in any other way I possibly can if you were absent for valid reasons.  That includes absences due to grave illness or accident as well as illness, accident or death of a close family member.  It also includes urgent hospital appointments that cannot be re-scheduled without incurring unacceptably long waiting times.  Finally, it includes a genuine inability to make your way to Belfield due to public transportation strikes, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters.  Needless to say, you need to be able to credibly substantiate any of these reasons. 

2) I will NOT accept excuses of the following kind (all of which are examples of actual excuses by lecture-skipping students I have been presented with over the past couple of years): playing football, watching a friend play football, going away for a long weekend, attending a driving test, being hungover, lacking motivation, fatigue, attending a star trek convention, shopping for a birthday present, attending a job interview (unless you can credibly demonstrate that you could not schedule the interview for another time), getting married, getting divorced, showing foreign visitors around town, working, writing an essay for another course that would otherwise be late (you should have started it earlier), dental appointments (other than extreme emergencies), teeth-whitening, tanning, physiotherapy and counselling sessions, accidentally going to the wrong lecture theatre, forgetting the time of the lecture, picking up a friend from the airport, finding the lectures too long/boring, finding the lecture theatre too hot/cold/uncomfortable, getting your car serviced, not finding a car parking space, not being in the mood for a lecture, having lost interest in the subject half-way through the course, celebrating your birthday or a friend’s birthday, other lecturers allegedly not insisting on attendance (all lecturers want you to attend their lectures), not liking the lecturer/tutor, buses failing to show up on time (Dublin Bus is not known for its reliability and you need to leave home early enough to take account of this), etc.  
As a university student there is no single activity more important than attending lectures and tutorials, and I expect you to organise your ENTIRE social and working life around it.  Students who fail to do this should expect neither sympathy nor help.  Moreover, since the exam will be very heavily based on the content of the lectures, lecture-dodgers had better prepare themselves for a nasty surprise on exam day.  

: I'm an angry swiss man and you better go to class or i'll beat you with my muhfuckin cuckoo clock.
Eh, I'll share the one I gave as a student back in my days.  It was 7th grade.  I was your typical SAP, quiet and uncomfortable in my own skin.  I had a social science class right after lunch, and the classroom was on the opposite position in school from the lunchroom.  The teacher who taught the history lesson was an off-rocker sort of lady who seemed to like the nondisruptive me, but I could never tell whether or not she would blow up on a given day.  Generally I ran from the lunchroom to my locker and then to the room in order to avoid being late her 6th period class.  But on this certain day, I could not.  The douche of a girl I called my friend, Sarah, held me back so I could help open her locker.  Painfully, I tried to stutter my protest to her, but alas, she paid no attention and death gripped my arm to help her open her jammed locker.  I obliged.  After, I quickly scrambled to my locker as the bell rang.  With my things in my chubby little hands, I slowly walked over to her class.  Right outside her door, taking a deep breath, I thought to myself, "Either I'm going to her class with shame or not give one shit."  Fuck it.  Composing myself in the most pretentious manner, I stepped inside.  The teacher's voice rang out, "acridict, you're late.  What were you doing?" I, with the most placid face I could muster, calmly say, "I was busy flying my unicorn.  She was having troubles this morning." The volatile teacher took one look at me with a straight face and said, "Okay.  Take a seat." For the rest of the period, I was silent and slightly shaking from my excuse.  I wasn't given a detention or tardy that day.
"I was busy flying my unicorn.  She was having troubles this morning."
I read a really good idea a while back for a more realistic type game. I can't find the article but basically it was nothing more than a level 5 cap- most mortals, players included, cannot progress beyond level 5. You were allowed to progress further through a feat system with really good bonuses such as +2 to an attribute, more spell slots, etc. but even with this the power level was quite low. The XP progression was also slowed so when a normal character would be level 10 these guys would only be just hitting 5. The idea is that level 5 is where the characters start to move from the absolute best a human can do to superhuman and the game starts getting less relatable. 
I can see it mixing quite well with a low/no magic setting- start by axing the primary casters (cleric/druid/sorc/wiz) from player options- they may still exist in the world in few numbers or as the only member of their class. Multiclassing into those classes later may be an option, at your discretion.
The next most powerful caster is the bard- his magical music and spells may be more than you wish to include. You could reduce his spells down to a 4 level progression like the ranger or paladin and maybe add more skill points or some other mundane abilities to keep things balanced.
The ranger and paladin's magic fits better into a low magic world- generally buffs, detection and other "quiet" stuff.
I don't think there is that great a need to introduce greater amounts of customization even in a core only, no magic game. There are four broad ways to play a fighter (2handed/two weapon/sword and shield/ranged), two ways to play a ranger, the monk, the barbarian with all the fighter's melee options, the bard (which can be played more ways than any other class) and paladin, and couple different rogue builds (melee/ranged/stealth/social) even without any of the primary casting classes. Throw in the usual races, and the fact that this is an RP heavy game, and you'll have plenty to work with.
 For a realistic, low magic 3.5 game with minimum modifications, cap the levels at 5, slow down XP, remove the primary casters and nerf the bards magic.
Before you get too excited about training, you need to climb a lot more.  The best way to get better at climbing (at least at first) is to climb more.  You will need to slowly strengthen tendons and muscles over time.  ****DO NOT RUSH INTO ANY HEAVY STRENGTH TRAINING****.  You may look at some people in the gym and think "Damn they are insane I want to be like them."  You can hurt yourself and cause a lot of grief by over training.  Don't rush into it.  You will get to their level if you keep climbing.  It may take some time, but you can get there.  

Your technique will improve over time too.  This is the most important thing for beginners.  Basics like how to place your feet, and different body positions to make it easier to climb only come with practice.  No amount of youtube videos will help you much there besides some very elementary pointers.
Here is a [video]( for inspiration though!
*** Climb more, you will improve.***
Upvote. The downvote count is fuzzed for spam reasons, and as the total number of points increases, the downvote count will gradually converge to twice the total points and the upvote count will gradually converge to 3 times the total points, so that the points total is accurate but the upvote / downvote numbers gradually become total bullshit.
 If enough people upvote, it'll drag *both* the upvote and downvote numbers up.
paragraphs and tl/dr dude
Yeah, it would be awesome if before every tournament their could be a march-madness-like site where you can make your own bracket and predictions.
Also, I really like this idea but the way you have it set up is kind of annoying =/. There's too many numbers / slots and teams to keep track of. I had to pull out a piece of paper and do it there. It would be awesome if you could just "click" on which team would win each match. And then the loser bracket is automatically made from the choices you make. It's kind of hard to explain what I'm trying to say without pictures, but I don't think it would be too hard to code (I'm a web developer and webmaster of my university) 

**TLDR**: Awesome idea and I wish every tourney had this, but it would be nicer if it was a graphic click interface where you can see the bracket. 
I model for art classes, but it isn't sexual at all.  It's professional and emphasizes the formal aspect of the human shape.  Yet sometimes I feel like I'm holding back a natural part of myself when I model for these classes.  (Not to say that it isn't a blast, it's just different.)  The human body can't help but be sexual sometimes, so I embrace that in my photos.
As for why I post them publicly....I'm not sure.  It's nice sharing something that I'm proud of.  And I won't lie; the attention is exciting; though, my most valued comments are those that appreciate the aesthetic qualities of a photo, and the gw photos I like most have thoughtful artistic qualities.  And...it gets me hot and bothered :) 
The body can communicate so much in so many ways.  It can be a simple form, no more than shapes, shadows.  But it can also express and evoke emotions.  It can create complex concepts fueled by thought, like a fantasy or an idea of the character of a person.  This is one way to explore how that all can happen.
Thanks for asking this question.  It gave me a chance to ramble passionately.
 It's fun, it's a creative outlet, it gets me hot and bothered (who doesn't like being turned on), it's an exploration of the power of the human body.
It's annoying for me being in Australia, most games that are rated 18 in other countries get away with 15+ here. I'm 15 yet I can't use my actual DOB because they don't recognise that I can buy the game according to our system. 
 I have to lie about my DOB even when I shouldn't have to.
Yeah, but it wasn't Shepard, so they obviously did it wrong. I thought it would be cool if Shep went down to the Yahg homeworld and kicked some Yahg ass that's high up in their government, making him one of their leaders. Then he could command them to come help fight the reapers.

You have the best s
Your body is only really capable of producing a few substances, in different quantities... so things like mucus, wax, sweat, semen, saliva, or milk tend to be made up of varying concentrations of salts, sugars, proteins, antibodies, other cells, and water.
Now, *mucus* is produced by special cells in your body (not any one gland). It is mainly a mixture of water and glycoproteins (which are proteins that make the mucus viscous).
These mixtures also have salts that make it unfavorable for bacteria/fungi to grow, enzymes designed to eat away at viruses/bacteria/fungi, antibodies, and some other immune-related proteins.
So mucus is basically a sticky solution created by cells as a part of the immune system to protect you from bacteria and viruses and coats sensitive areas of the body, like the throat, nose, lungs, vagina, etc, etc.
Naturally, the respiratory system (mouth, nose, throat, and lungs) need a lot of mucus because it has to deal with the most outside invaders... all the bacteria and fungi that you inhale. When the cells in your body realize that you've gotten sick, they produce more mucus to expel the invaders of your body... you end up coughing up lung mucus and dripping nose mucus because your body is removing bacteria to make you healthy again and prevent you from getting more sick.
**If bacteria was in an adventure story, mucus would be a cross between quicksand and a piranha pit... not only is there no escape, but you get eaten while you're trying.**
You're not going to be running at full capacity if your body thinks it is sick. It changes the body physiology and goes on lockdown until it's safe to be healthy again. It also ends up making special proteins that increase your body temperature (giving you a fever) to kill off bacteria, with the side effect of making it so your body can't run a marathon efficiently.
Would the material to make that mucus have gone to waste? Not really. Your body is pretty amazing about resource management that way.
**Your body is the Starship Enterprise. When your body is under attack, it diverts power to forward shields**.
There are certain cells in your body called neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that eat the bad stuff in your body and digest them with special enzymes.
One type of enzyme they have is called [myeloperoxidase]( These enzymes have a chemical group on them called heme, which makes it green.
Side note: [Your sinuses take up a lot of room in your head.]( It's no wonder you have a lot of mucus.
**Your mucus is green because it has green stuff in it.**
Note that there's a limit to how much energy the body can use - this limit being set by the availability of oxygen and the ability of the body to cool itself - if the body has to spend energy on digestion, although in the end you'll end up with more _stored_ energy, you have to actually spend _less_ energy on your immune system in order to keep digestion going. So catabolizing your fat stores in order to spend more energy on defense rather than digestion.
*** when your body has forces pushing at its ramp it spends its larva on zerglings, not drones
I'm confused as well, but I tried to come up with something based on the dictionary definitions. I'll get to hokum, but I feel like explaining the whole picture too. :)
Hokum: (Merriam Webster definitions)
&gt;1
&gt;: a device used (as by showmen) to evoke a desired audience response
&gt;
&gt;2
&gt;: pretentious nonsense : bunkum
I think the picture is saying a few things. The first thing you notice is that while the religions are different, the descriptions are the same, making them very similar. Yet they are both saying that they wish the other was more like them, even though their only difference is their religion. This makes you wonder how religion can make us all feel so different from one another yet we are really all the same.
Then you get to what the words say. "Easily Weaponized, Superstitious." Makes you think about how these two groups of people can be easily frightened by the other and form false beliefs due to them being different, but if their are both doing that what is actually causing them to feel threatened?
So from the definitions of Hokum I would say the first one might be the meaning here, and that each side comes up with lies (superstitions) about the other to cause their side to feel threatened by the other. This causes sides to become "weaponized" and causes dangerous situations to arise based on differences in religion. So I guess the second definition holds true as well, that is all pretentious nonsense created to keep us in fear of one another.
**-
We are all the same when it comes down to it. No need to fear the insignificant differences that make us individuals.**
Okay screw it, about half way through that I realized I am not a very good art critic or that great at describing my thoughts, but damn it I was determined to give my interpretation.
What about if a team of highly trained operatives flew helicopters into the private compound of a leader, shot him in the face, and dumped his body in the ocean?
Oh, wait, shit. We did that.
But no, no, no see **OUR** violence is always justified, and **THEIR** violence is never justified. When **WE** act it's for the greater good. I'm sure **THEY** twiddle their mustaches and cackle like Dr. Evil before they use violence.
**** You think your sides use of violence is always OK, and that violence against your side is always wrong, and yet you fail to realize that they feel EXACTLY the same way for exactly the same reasons.
Christian apologists are tiresome.
I am an American. About as pasty as people come.
 My wife is an east African. She is much more tribalist than you and expects me to follow the "rules". I told her I wasn't paying dowry when she mentioned it before we were married. Initially I was very offended by it so she didn't talk about it for a long time, but clearly the issue wasn't settled because she still brings it up.
 She's says going to pay it herself, but it still pisses her off that I won't pay it. I try to talk to her on her own terms, pointing out that I didn't collect a dowry for my sisters, but she's pretty unreasonable on this. I feel like she's putting a lot of pressure on herself to pay it and taking it out on me. I'm honestly not at fault though. It's her culture that demands this but she's completely unwilling to find fault in it. 
 She already talks of collecting dowry for our daughters, which is aggravating. The oldest is not even three.
 Good for you.
**EDIT:**  Sorry for the long post and it is no way meant as a direct response to HalfPointFive's situation.  I just felt that there is a lot of confusion about dowry and it is not easy for me to explain in a few words...
I think the idea of ‘paying dowry has got lost in translation over the years.  Its modern day/western interpretation is ‘buying’ or ‘paying for a wife’.  To understand how this worked many years ago, you must have an understanding of what marriage meant to our ancestors (and when I say ‘ours’ I am generalizing because marriage customs across Africa differ not just from country to country but between ethnic groups of the same nationality).  
Back in the day a family would live together in one humungous compound or a series of compounds close together.  The definition of family back then (and even for many African’s today) would include all those that in the Western world would be considered extended family members.  A fathers’ older sister would not be your aunt, she would be your ‘big mother’, your cousins would be your brothers and sisters.   It would not be unheard of to have a whole village that consisted of one family.  For many cultures marrying within your family would be considered taboo.  Anyone looking for a potential life partner, would have to travel outside of their compound/village in search of a spouse.  This was a time before cars and possibly even before push bikes so what would be considered a two hours drive by today’s standard would be considered a good two or three day’s walk.  
In those days it was mainly the men who did the long distance travelling, either to find food, fight battles or deliver messages to other villages/families.  Many men would use this opportunity to find a wife, especially since marriage had many purposes back in the day.  It wasn’t just about love and procreation, it was also about forging a range of social, diplomatic, political and economic links with other villages and families.
It was customary then, as it is now, for the wife, after the marriage ceremonies (yes most African cultures have stages of marriage ceremonies) to leave her family compound and live with her husband in his compound.  For most women once they left their family compound they rarely returned because of the distance involved and the structures of family life that meant the women stayed close to the family compound and jointly raised children, cooked etc.   So for the family of the bride they were losing a valued and loved member who would not be returning.  A whole village compound was losing a sister, daughter etc.  Furthermore they were entrusting total strangers with their loved one, hoping that the members of the wife’s new family would love and care for her in the same way her family would.  For the old person, it was also more than just a loss of a person, it was giving up the chance to be involved in the future of this woman.  It was very hard for maternal grandparents, because many of them would never see their grandchildren and they would have to hope that the paternal grandparents would do a good job.
This is where dowry came in.  Dowry was never paid  in cash,  it was often a series of symbolic items, many of high value – such as prized cattle.  The family of the husband would send representatives with gifts and items of value to serve as compensation to the wife’s family for their loss; to serve as a gesture of goodwill indicating that they recognised the value of the woman to the community and they were willing to give up something of value to prove this. Most importantly it was also meant to serve as a link between the families, something that would exist if not for eternity at least for many years. 
It would have been inconceivable to marry a woman without offering dowry because the husband’s family would be in essence saying that the woman was worthless (not as a commodity but as a valued member of the her old family).   
For many modern day Africans, both in Africa and in the diaspora, dowry is still exchanged. Some pay cash, rightly or wrongly.  Some however provide the wife’s family merely symbolic items as means of honouring the tradition. 
**TL/DR:**  Dowry is not about ‘buying’ a wife.  It is an age old practice that came into being as means to compensate the wife’s family/village for their loss, to forge relationships between two families, to build trust and mostly to honour and respect the value of the woman. 
Yes, I minored in anthropology and understand the different theories of dowry and that was a good synopsis. However, in my personal experience, that's not how it often works in practice. Many parents abuse the system as a money making venture. The OP alluded to this. The potential for the abuse and the fact that it's no longer relevant is why I object to it.
I'm not militant against dowry. I'm just not willing to participate if I get married. I made this clear to her. If she wanted a dowry she was free to marry another gentleman.
  It can be and often is.
edit:  Sorry for contributing to the confusion.  I should have made it more clear that it's not actually considered and usually isn't "buying a wife".
To all those responding with, "Well, why does this entire thing matter/why is this even an issue/why is this on the front page":
First, I believe it's on the front page because enough readers find the issue relevant/interesting or may identify with it enough to upvote it to the front page. 
Second, you're not thinking about this situation from her point of view, or you may not be able to picture where she is coming from because you've never been exposed to it. 
My parents are immigrants. They may have lived here for 20+ years now but they were still born and raised in another country, long enough for the country's specific culture to be solidly ingrained into their mindsets. Ever since I was young, my parents, particularly my mother (it's always the mothers that are more adamant), have constantly been telling me about the type of Korean man I should marry, the expectations both my family and my future husband's family will have (whoever they are), the tasks that a good Korean wife is expected to carry out, the role we must fill in the family, etc. etc. etc. ad infinitum. A very large chunk of Korean culture is centered around offspring marrying, and marrying as well as possible. (Just look to the Korean dramas for further proof.)
So when you're raised by two people that have a dramatic influence on you that have very set ideals about this important life event for over 20 years, you develop a strong instinct for what they (and the extended family) want and also what they definitely will oppose. That includes the race of the future spouse.
 
American as we children may think we are, we never want to disappoint our parents or fail them through any means because that would disrupt the family, "shame" the family (community gossip/reputations), etc. On top of it all, we know our parents busted ass to become successful in their adopted country and don't want to ruin that at all - because we know that the #1 reason they busted ass and are successful is because it was all for us, the children. 
So that's why it "matters" to us. Non-immigrant families in America that are several generations down the line of immigrants have already gotten over this, and so of course they may not understand this issue. I'm sure it also existed in the European-American immigrant cultures of the past. 
So you can see that immigrant children have a humongous load of expectations and pressure to balance and be mindful of while still balancing their more "free" American side and their own desires and preferences. This results in them stressing over the race of the person they will marry. It can actually be a huge stress that isn't always dwelled upon, but is always present in the back of them mind. I mean, I was always wary of telling my parents that I wanted to pursue a career in the arts because I didn't know how they would react. ("You can't make money in the arts/How can you waste our time and devotion and money and hard work for something in the arts/blah blah blah")
As I'm second generation, I know my kids won't have the level of pressure and expectations my siblings and I are going through to marry/date someone. 
I hope this was clarifying for some.
**EDIT:** Whoa, wall of text! Sorry for the long read.

I totally understand your point and I'll try to respond in the best way I know how. 
I was raised "old school" in the meaning that my father was the financial caregiver of our household. We're talking a wife, 2 children and 4 step children (that's 6 kids folks!). He was the one that worked 1-2 jobs depending on the season, he was the one that came home tired and exhausted and all of us - WE were the ones that "took care of him" when he came home. 
We would literally sit in front of the TV and change the channel when he wanted us to (no remote controllers back then, we literally sat in front of the tv for hours!), we would bring him a diet coke in a glass with ice (or a beer) when he wanted one, we would serve his plate first when we ate dinner together as a family.....things like this is what I mean when I say "old school". 
As that was how I was raised, I truly see NOTHING wrong with it..my father brought home the money and took care of our household, so to be "subserviant" was really, truly only a small price to pay in thankfullness to him. 
Now, as an adult female, I understand and see how some people will take everything I've said the wrong way but DM/GUTW/STW. 
 Doesn't Matter, Grew Up That Way, Still That Way.

Because you can't tell why somebody did something without reading their minds. 
If a white man kills a black man because the black man owes him money, and the white man has a history of making racist remarks, he will probably get charged with a hate crime even though race was not the main motivation. This essentially means he is being given a harsher penalty because of his personal beliefs.
 It gives the government too much power to let them punish based on what they *think* the person's motivation was.
I think you've quite missed the point of the general hostility towards normally right-minded religious people who, when giving condolences to people in need, pray for them. The reason that many atheists show ambivalence or even anger towards these people is because the act of praying takes away any responsibility for actually providing help, because in some sense they believe that "God" has played a part in saving/helping the person or people in need. Atheists feel that all the credit should go to the human beings who actually provided assistance. Atheists like me believe that religious people are simply passing the buck (to borrow an American phrase) by spewing out platitudes such as this. I agree that religious individuals are generally generous people and will give their time and money to charity, but simply saying that they will pray for someone is worth nothing in my opinion.
**  Theists are passing the buck by using throwaway platitudes such as "I will pray for you" **
A related letter by the esteemed Daniel Dennett: [THANK GOODNESS! [11.3.06] 
By Daniel C. Dennett](

A tweet of mine regarding Fabrice Muamba's on-field heart attack recently resulted in a torrent of attacks from some rather hard-line atheists, none of whom were following me.
My comments basically stated that I was getting sick of other atheists taking the oppertunity to snipe and generally be a douchebag to anyone using the #pray4muamba hashtag. Further comments I made stating that plenty of folk, religious or atheist, were using the tag to support the stricken player were rubbished outright. Basically, if I didn't agree with them I clearly wasn't atheist.
Nearly all of them shared a commonality. The first serious thing their profiles said about themselves was that they were athiest.  Personally, I can talk about many other things that make me who I am as a person, before reaching the subject of atheism.
You're atheist, I'm atheist. Great. We don't believe in gods. We believe in science and fact. We're not relegious. Awesome, glad we got that out of the way.
 What you're not doesn't make you who you are. If you think it does, you need to get your priorities straight.
Good stuff sir! I feel fairly strongly about this and you've just put into words what i couldn't be bothered too. So I feel silly now so I'll give my two cents on the matter.
I was recently in hospital for a long time and was in pretty bad shape. it was a given that I would be there for a while so someone had to phone my Landlord and explain that I won't be able to pay my rent for a while because I was in hospital. I am a cynical bastard so i did not expect a decent reaction. in fact he said it was fine and I should just pay when I'm well and able. Pretty awesome. Fast forward 7 weeks or so and I'm just out of hospital and my Landlord drops round, right out of the blue and these were his words. 'I prayed for you every day. Can you drink? i'm gonna buy you a crate of beer.'.
Now I'm an atheist and was really taken aback by this. I interpreted the gesture as saying 'I thought about you and wished that would get better'. I feel that alot of atheists would have interpreted this as 'hurrr I helped you get better because I prayed to Gawwwd hurrr' but this is not the case at all you silly people.
 Upvote for gapyearwellspent.

In every group there are jerks. The Simpsons taught me that. (STAMPY!)
I think that there exists a fine line here.... and it's all about context and interpretation. A lot of comments have touched on this.
How many people imagine a smug, 17 year old kid with an emo haircut, sitting in his parent's basement?
Try thinking about someone who just lost parts of his life, possibly everything, a man who no longer has a home, or pets, and possibly lost a family member. In THAT instance, I can kind of understand a smarmy bitterness.
It's the difference between "Tchyah, whatEVer. Your god is like, totally fake" and "Bitch, if you want to help me, then *actually* help me." 
That is an **important** difference. 
Context. Interpretation.
Now, do if someone says something about "prayers for a sick child", then... really, most people aren't doctors, so they're not going to be able to directly help. Could they donate to research? Sure. But I think in THIS instance, the "pray for you" thing is an "I'm here for you." It's to help let this person feel that they are not alone, that they have friends, etc. 
Pick your battles. Don't try to knock down the sense of community and support. Do point out that prayer is completely ineffective if it's being used as a way to alleviate guilt through inaction when action is required. Example: saying "I'll pray for you," to a kid that broke an ankle when a trip to the hospital is in order.

(Now, I will say that I also understand the argument that, when the sentiment is expressed to you, being silent implies consent and agreement with the statement and all its baggage. And that letting that implication stand could weaken the strength and independence of the atheist community. [We stand as godless, but tacitly accept the idea of god helping us.]  So....yeah. that argument can be made. But I think it needs to be made at a *separate* time. )
Just my two cents.
*** It's all about the context of the people involved and how the sentiment is interpreted. 
Here's the problem. Well wishes are good, but people consider them good enough. It's not. People need to take active steps to help one another. I'm aware this will be buried under a thousand comments, but it's the humanist inside of me that you hath angered. If all you can do is pray, that's fine. But if you could do more, you should. I'm not able to do much at my age for people. This makes me even more angry at the people who can, because I would kill to have the chance to go to Dallas and help, or send money, but I can't.
It's not that prayer is bad. It's that they are convinced it's enough. It's not. Help people. God would commend that. Your heavenly figure would tell you to do so. Yet all you do is sit and wish them to be better.
 It's nice to pray, but wishing someone well when you could actually help is horrible.
I high school my friends called me pocahontas:
My friend had a cheap longbow that I had restrung with shoe string. I made makeshift arrows out of sharpened dowel rods and fins from darts. We went out to a friends land, and within 30 minutes I had killed a field mouse and a rabbit.
That said, I felt really bad about it afterwards :-( those are the only two animals I've ever killed, and I wouldn't do it again.
They called me pocahontas for the rest of high school. It still come sup occasionally.
 Makeshift bow, killed animals, feels bad man
I'm not sure if I agree with you or not but I respect you for your decision and motives. I've been having a similar dilemma with what you've mentioned and some other things I wish not to disclose at this moment. 
 You still have a degree. I might not walk either. 
Most of the times this is caused by the following:
- not run as admin
- Security soft like AV or Firewall blocking the check on some files
- Corrupted install files
- Modifications
(if for example you used D2loader or an Editor or what not, might explain you using v 1.12 (unless you just reinstalled via the download files ;) ) 
Best would be to redownload and reinstall as previously said by MoonShatters and don't forget to run the install as Admin too will save you some hastle with patching later on when connecting to b.net.
P.S. don't connect to b.net with a modified version (d2loader or editor) Your key will probably get banned. 
- possible causes, solution reinstall 
Everyone's opinions are influenced by someone else's, for better or for worse.  But people should definitely have a talking to if they are still harboring such moronic opinions about women, animals or ethnic minorities.  People put too much value in opinions and the idea that these opinions shouldn't be contested in anyway.

If someone's being a racist shitbag either call them out or stop being their friend.
I was in the same boat you were in (Age wise, not views on health care).  I'd just gotten home from 3 months in South America, I got home right before Xmas so I wasn't looking for a job.  On the way home from a Christmas party the car I was in got hit by a drunk driver.  I was knocked unconscious, I woke up in the ambulance, after 8 hours in the ER, xrays, and a CT scan.  I never got a bill, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been able to pay for that bill and school.  I now have a STEM degree and work a good job contributing to society. 
  Universal health care makes society better.
You dodged a bullet. Deep down, she lacked logical reasoning; thus -- crazy. You almost put your dick in crazy. I did, and now I have a bs restraining order against me that she got after I threatened harassment charges. 
 
 don't put your dick in crazy. 
I like your point of view, but I'm one where I sometimes find some sort of spiritual interest of a god existing to proving myself wrong about the existence of a type of god existing. I'm constantly in flux. I'm personally surprised that 99 % of the world isn't this way as well. I'm personally surprised that the rest of the world tries to ask religious questions and qualifying those questions somehow and writing them down as evidence in a book.
Back on point, as I find more and more atheists in existence, it would seem that a drive in life for some would be a longer lifespan if they personally are too have a longer "dent" on the world. I guess I was only viewing it from a DNA point of view. My reasoning was out of generally the cause or a link can be made to state that this is where most problems arise, be it because the DNA doesn't go too far to overcome problems (chain smokers who get cancer as opposed to chain smokers who get on fine) or DNA doesn't replicate right.
We do in the medical field give topical solutions to deeper issues. The classic examples are giving a high-blood pressure patient medication instead of treating the real issue of food intake. I would go a step further and argue that our DNA is designed to continually add nutrients to the blood stream (cavemen days needed all they could get for instance) instead of having a signal to turn off the excess nutrient flow into the blood stream.
Granted, sadly, we are definitely not there yet. Of all of the people who look to life as being the Apex of existence, it would seem the atheists would be gunning for this type of research.
(Can't wait to watch that video, I think it will touch highly on what I want to know !)
***: Atheists are very cool because I think they generally are for healthy living here on earth and am curious if they strive for great excellence in biological health taking the extra steps to fix the whole problem.
I think that the truth for most of us is that we're constantly coming to terms with the boundaries of our existence. Someone is thinking about going back to school, but next year, that dream is gone as it's "too unrealistic" or "I can't take care of the kids and go back to school". 
The sad thing about life for me is that it's always something stopping me from doing what I love. Even just having to work for 10 hours a day to pay my bills means that I'm wasting most of my life at work, not enjoying the fact that I'm alive. Everyone says that "it's normal", but is it acceptable? I question whether or not it is acceptable every day. 
Another sad thing about life is that most (if not all) of us are completely replaceable. There isn't anything that we can do that others can't, and if we never existed, something wouldn't have. It's even true of kids; how many times have you met someone that looks quite a bit like you, or acts similarly to you? So even if I have children, they are replaceable as there is only so many unique aspects of a human being. 
The point is that my existence is without much joy and completely without meaning, so I would much rather be in a dream world where I could concoct the nature of my existence at will, and just enjoy the thoughts and experiences that occurred, instead of whittling away my physical life of mediocrity. Sure I could change my real life in some ways, but does it really matter? I could invent a special type of footwear for felines and strike it rich, but does it matter that I did that? No. And beyond that, someone else will probably invent whatever it is that's in my head anyway, negating anything that I ever could accomplish anyway. It's either one person gaining the fame and the fortune, or it's another.
 We're all on a ride that we didn't ask to get on, and we have to deal with constant obstacles for even the smallest things, so I would unequivocally choose to live in an imaginary world without those constraints.
Sure. Forgive the length of the answer: It's for good intent. It's my hope that more people see business as a good and necessary endeavor that doesn't have to be in conflict with your core ideals.
So much of what we *think* we should do in our lives isn't what we are actually willing to do. We're a culture that celebrates individual effort, financial success, and is goal oriented. That's a lot of potential conflict with yoga. It's an ongoing development process of self discovery, of personal understanding, and as a journey right from the outset. Increased health, strength and flexibility are actually just positive side effect of yoga, as are mindfulness, meditation and awareness. 
*Yoga is an ongoing process. In the realm of personal development that journey* **is** *the outcome.*
As a yoga teacher and possibly even a studio owner, there's an additional challenge. It's a challenge that any artist, trainer or artisan runs up against when they go from just a need to share their experience to a desire to monetize their knowledge: *You're no longer just a yoga teacher, you're a business owner.* 
You have to possess a skill set and goal-focused drive that will allow you to create and be a good steward to a sustainable business. It sounds like a recipe for conflict at first blush. So you have to change the context... Because without that skill set, your ability to impact the lives of others to it's maximum potential is significantly dampened. 
If the context is not changed, it can cause you a lot of ongoing frustration, and financial challenges that will significantly impact your ability to teach and offer counsel without compromise. To paraphrase Rumi: *There is no right or wrong; there is only what works or what doesn't work.*
Attempting to make a living or run a business without understanding it's functions *doesn't work.* I've seen it too many times to tell people otherwise in good conscience. Treating it as something you have to care for, foster and grow *does work*. 
The longer your business is running, the more people you can reach and the more opportunities for change you can affect in people's lives are offered. In turn, it will sustain you, so long as you take care of it. Like a fruit tree, but with an accountant. ;)
Now, I'm confident that anyone who wants to teach others is typically coming from a good intent. They make the decision to make that their avocation. *That's honorable.* Some of my favorite clients are professionals who see teaching as a natural progression in their own development; they're driven to share in the positive experience with others. That's truly noble, and helps us make a dent in the universe. 
*So you have to have the personal integrity and honesty to say you can do both and that you're willing to put in the effort.* 
If you're *not* willing to learn what it takes to reach out to a larger number of people (and I'm referring specifically here to skills like marketing, sales and operations), or at the very least retain others to do so for you, you have to accept and be good with your diminished capacity and ability to meet, teach, and foster growth in others. 
It's as if you arbitrarily choose to only do asanas for the left side of you body. You'll develop, sure; but your possibility is hampered. It you want to reach maximum potential, you need to balance them.
I've read a lot of answers in here about it not being about the money, and I accept that this is a valid opinion. I also want to submit two ideas: 
*The first is that if someone has given money the emotion of negativity, they've limited their personal capability.* 
*I'll submit instead that money is only a transfer of energy: It's an expression associated with appreciation of effort.* 
You go to work, and are compensated for the effort. You live in a place, and compensate them for the space. They wish to learn, and appreciate you by paying you for the experience. *None of that is bad. It is just what works.*
If too many people think you're 'too expensive', then you have to be willing to accept the possibility that the experience they are getting is not exceeding their expectations. If you want to reach more people, you have to understand marketing so that you can effectively draw more possibility. If you aren't getting enough signups for classes or personal sessions or retreats, you have to strengthen your ability to convey the value of the experience to them (*that's all sales is, after all: a compelling exchange that offers an experience*). 
There's any number of ways to address these challenges so that you offer a better experience and assist more people on their journey, especially if you aspire to make as big an impact as possible... However: 
***- If you say you want to do something at a larger level, and then have limiting beliefs, limited knowledge, diminished motivation, and/or conflicting obligations, it will directly impact your reach and ability. Those constraints modify your aspirations.***
If that's where you are and what you want, that is totally cool. If you want more, you have to accept that challenge. Remember; **It doesn't change you if it doesn't challenge you.** This is how everyone who gets into and stays in yoga changes and grows. 
It's true in any endeavor. :)
**This. ^ ^** 
*(My response is LONG. I'm going to offer some additional insights from a business perspective as well. I'm interested in yoga on a personal level, I've worked with thousands of small business owners, trainers and artisans, and my girlfriend is a yoga instructor. I've seen some stuff.)*
I agree with a lot of this, and the realistic outlook of it. This is an aspect of the aspirations of teaching yoga that a lot of people may not be aware of... **Big names are Outliers.** Celebrity teachers are Outliers. Even the studio owners I've worked with are Outliers.
The personal conflicts you mentioned in your post are a lot more common in yoga teachers than you might think.
As a personal example: This is almost *verbatim* my girlfriend's feelings and concerns about yoga today. You have my empathy. We talk about it often; the concerns about standardization, the money, the personal conflict of earning a living versus over-commercialization... You name it. I empathize with you about it. 
On a professional level: I don't like to see people fail in business. Or struggle. People should get what they're worth. Some of this comes from hard choices on an individual level. I know enough about the formulae to craft a business model that will yield a successful service-based business; I've done it many times form any people. 
What we struggled with was that who she is and how she wants to live her life were not in alignment with a studio and the rigors of running a business. So, she sticks to corporate clients, teaching at other people's studios and some private practice. As she wants more, she goes and gets more. When she wants to travel, we do that. She makes her money and I make mine. If and when she wants to make the choice of opening a studio, we'll do that. She's heard me talk enough about consulting small business owners that she'd be fine without my meddling. ;)
Understand: Making a living and doing what you love are **not** mutually exclusive. There's nothing wrong with aspiring for more if that's what you want. 
*There's also nothing wrong with charging more for your instruction, so long as the market will bear it.*
There's a lot of factors that come into play: but you might be surprised to learn that at the end of the day, there are probably only 2, maybe 3 things that separate where you are now from where you want to be.
* The first is **testing your business.** Are your customers happy? How do you know? Are you advertising enough? Are you doing enough outreach? Events? Are you communicating enough with your existing customers? The more happy they are, the more quality service you provide, the more your market can bear. Are there systems in place and a schedule for them to start coming to you more often?
* The second is to **be aware of the differences in your market.** Take Black Swan in Austin; most of the classes are donation based (at least they were when I was there). Austin can bear it; they've been able to craft their place there in an already crowded market. So if you're in the middle of the country where they aren't as health conscious (like we are in Michigan) corporate wellness programs and lunch-and-learns are a good supplement where you bring the benefits to them. 
* **Know yourself.** You are only going to do what you are willing to accept. *Sometimes our aspirations run against our intentions.* Meditate on it, and consider it carefully. Unnecessary commercialization happens, but many instructors come from a place of good intent. I'm confident that you are as well. I know Shiva Rea and Seane Corn. I'm happy for their success. They not only put the work in, they give back. 
So that's something I'd ask you to consider... 
***Your capacity to help others can be positively magnified by an increase in your personal revenue, so long as you approach it from that standpoint and own both your personal sense of self-worth and accept responsibility for the actions it will take to achieve more financially.***
***- Be mindful. Choose deliberately. Decide conscientiously. When it's time, move with purpose. Act without regret. Be comfortable in the knowledge that whatever you choose to do, it's the right thing if you feel like it lines up with who you are, and angles towards who you want to be more of.***
*You have my support and best wishes. If you have any questions I can answer, I'm happy to do so. Thanks for teaching and seeking to impact positive change.* :)
Honestly, I feel like the rate that I learn things is kind of exponential. Ie, the years of coding I did before high school seemed to be kind of overtaken by what I learned in high school (so what I did before high school seemed kind of insignificant in comparison), and the same goes for what I've learned so far in college compared to what I learned in high school. So in other words, I tend to feel like the stuff I did on my own prior to college didn't give me too much of an edge. I guess it's kind of like someone not training for something at all vs someone who does train, but with supervision. If/when both people get a trainer, the guy who did train a bit beforehand won't have too much of an edge because he didn't totally know what he was doing. Granted, some of how I advanced in the past year might have had more to do with being able to build on my own knowledge, as opposed to being taught new things by others.
Anyway, -- don't sweat it, just practice and do fun stuff and you'll get better.
Also, I should add that Herzog is the _computer science_ undergraduate adviser, not just a general undergraduate adviser.
Last year, a roommate of mine and his girlfriend were at a party together. She was obviously hammered drunk. They got into a fight and she grabbed her keys in order to leave.
She pulls out into the road, he stands in front of the car to prevent her from driving away because she was in NO shape to drive. The bitch floors it and hits my then-roommate, knocking him onto the windshield, flipping off onto the pavement.
They're still together.
Bitches are crazy.   
One of my best friends has been in a relationship with a guy for going on two years. They have the Twilightesque obsessive love that teenagers are renowned for. She's currently attending school full time (we're all seniors in high school), working towards becoming a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and working up to 30 hours a week at a certain fast food chain. Her boyfriend is a musician in a shitty local band. He graduated a couple months ago, and doesn't have a job. She ends up buying him things like food and giving him gas money.
One day I was bored so I went to visit my friend while she was on break. Her boyfriend was also there, of course. We talked about school and our weekend plans and things like that. After her break was up I hung around to talk to her boyfriend. I don't know much about him, except that his band is his life. We were talking about work and he said,
"Yeah, I definitely couldn't work all the time like (my friend) does. She works crazy hours." I was floored. My friend is currently going to school, training to become a CNA, and working. His only obligation is to his band. I said,
"Yes, you definitely could. If anyone shouldn't be working crazy hours, it's your girlfriend."
Cue the whining about how he couldn't work nights and weekends, and really his band is going places so he should be getting money soon. Later he tried to complain to my friend about how I bitched him out.
**version My friends bf is a total mooch. I told him to get a job and he complained to my friend that I bitched him out.**
Had a friend let a woman convince him to marry her within their first year of knowing each other (this wasn't bad, but there were MANY warning signs on why this was bad for him to do). After they married, her mood went from being Miss Easy Going to Miss Psychotic MUST CONTROL EVERYTHING Bitch. She was in the Army at the time and located in a different state. She controlled him by phone and demanded he not hang out with his friends because it "wasn't fair to her" since she was so far away and unable to hang out with people. This didn't entirely work and he still hung out with friends, but limited it a little. Well then she dropped out of the Army to be closer to him. Suddenly where they were living was a horrible place, despite the fact that they both lived there for years and our friend loved the town to pieces. She demanded that they move to the other part of the country spontaneously. He went along with it. This ensured that he would never waste time hanging out with his friends anymore! Once she got his grips on him that way and they moved out of state she didn't seem to like that he was still interacting with all of us on FB so she began to harass us and start drama by attacking our individual lifestyles. We ignored it for the most part, but then she began making our friend go along with attacking our individual lifestyles. It got to be pretty depressing and eventually when friend insulted our other friends' parents' hospitality (the parents had let our friend live with them rent free for a year before he got married) that became the last straw. 
He did lots of other whipped things like let her decide his appearance, let her give up his motorcycle, convinced him to buy a house that wasn't anything he believed in (he hated subdivisions), but the worst was changing his mind about wanting to have children. He wanted to start a family one day and continue on his genes... It was something he really looked forward to. This woman hates kids and even said at one point that hearing a baby cry made her want to "smash its head against a brick wall". Naturally, she wasn't going to let him ever have kids with her, and so he gave up that dream as well. 
I still get angry thinking about all of it. Maybe not angry... Just... sad. 
 Friend lets woman convince him to marry her and she completely changes to bitch mode. Makes him move away and hate all his friends, changes his values in life, and takes away his dreams of having kids. 
I don't know, it seems like if it's actually affecting their relationship then he has a right to say something about it. Then again on the flip side of it all, if the girlfriend would go so far as to delete then readd the guy and continue to talk to him, then, well, it seems like she has some deep issues there with letting go of him and it'd probably be for the best to move on from her altogether. 
I was a victim of gaslighting by my ex, she pulled this with me actually. She had an ex that she said had basically raped her, who had been physically and mentally abusive, and who had tossed money at her to go away when she thought she was pregnant. She kept talking to him, both online and calling him and whatnot. It started affecting our relationship, like for example, we'd be sitting together on the couch watching a movie and he'd call, so she'd dash into the next room to talk to him despite me begging her to ignore the call.
She was fucking him behind my back for a large portion of time we were together, though, to be fair, I could share a large amount of fucked up things she did to him as well.
TL;DR
pomegranati has a right to a say so in the girl talking to her ex as it was affecting him. Though on the flip side of things there's likely more to what's going on than what she'd told him, and the stories of abuse were likely just that. Stories.
Double bounce boss here!  I used to be a fat kid with a trampoline in the back yard and learned my epic powers early in life.  After perfecting the double bounce I went on to other things.  After college myself and my fiancé were visiting my parents and that old trampoline was still there:  sun bleached and rusty springs.  My kind of party haha.  I jump on and goad my lady to follow who after seeing me take a few big bounces jumps on.  She's about 100# soaking wet and I'm about 200# at the time.  So we start jumping and having fun.  I do a "sumo sit". Where you basically jump really high and kick your legs out to land on your butt.  I do many of them and they are great fun.  I'm beat at this point and jump off the trampoline. She's still jumping and wants to try a sumo sit but she's nervous so I goad her on.  She finally does one and her butt blasts straight though the trampoline onto the ground.  I felt so bad after laughing historically for 15 minutes and checking to see if she was fine.  That moment will forever be one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Btw she was fine besides a grass stain.  
TLDR be ware of old tramps and there can be more danger to them than the springs.  The sun destroys their integrity over time.  
I have worked with chemicals used to clean steel in preparation for painting. Hardcore stuff. Anyhow, my partner accidentally splashed some in his eye, fortunately we have eye wash stations readily available. With in seconds he was rinsing his eyes with distilled water. After that he was to the hospital, received antibiotic eye drops, was fine in 2 weeks. We found out the eyeball actually has a high heal rate( is that right?).  
 Chemical in friends eye. Wash quickly with water. Fine. Eyes heal fast.
This one time, right around five years ago next month, I beat up a homeless person. He didn't do anything to us, but we beat him up because we crossed paths one night. I feel like shit about it, but you never know what you're going to do until you're there, you know?
Me and my friends were walking home from some party, all pretty toasted, and we had to walk home through the shady part of town because we forgot to make someone the DD. We saw him, just sitting there looking pathetic and defeated, and someone wispered, "Just do it. Come on, no one will believe him. We could get away with it." And we did it. We all knocked him down and just kept kicking him and kicking him until he was just laying there bloodied and bruised, without him saying so much as a word the whole time. It was almost like we were destined to beat him up, like he EXPECTED people to treat him like that.
The worst part, I think, was that he didn't fight back. Couldn't he have done something, ANYTHING, to defend himself, to make us stop, instead of just taking it like he deserved to be treated that way? It would have been easier on my soul to know I beat up a thinking, feeling human being than knowing I beat up a defeated man.
beat the shit out of some homeless dude for fun
You don't have to be a sociopath to utilize existing power structures. That's the beauty of institutionalized oppression!
 If you had serfs instead of minimum-wage employees, you'd use them too.

FAUST'S GETTIN' TROLLED
[This.]( This book is horrible. It has like 30 characters that it goes back and forth between. Very little interesting plot developments, and the writing style is as follows: Periods and commas are sometimes used sometimes it just goes from one thought to the next it makes it hard to read the style of writing confused me I would not recommend.
 It sucks, and is written like this part of this [song:]( which I like BTW.
edit: link doesn't work, just go to 14:00, or do yourself a favour and listen to the whole thing.
As someone who can use google:
"The word "hermaphrodite" suggests someone with complete male and female genitalia, but no such person really exists. What does exist are "intersex" people with "ambiguous genitalia." The specifics of what that means/looks like differs from person to person. Even a person called a "hermaphrodite" will only have 1 functional urethra, so whichever one they have (either one that goes through the penis or one that goes to the vulva), that's the one they'd use."
 You can't have tried peeing with both.
I can't vouch for PvE healing (my exposure has been a few normal mode EV/KP runs) but as an operative healing in PvP I do have a very good idea of how the healing breaks down (65 valor almost full BM).  The main problem I see with pvp healing guides is the emphasis being placed on positioning.  The main benefit as an operative is your mobility and people fail to use it to their advantage.  If your sitting on a top ledge spamming your long cast heal and Surgical probe 1 of two things is going to happen... 1) you will get los'd quickly and have to use your awful mobility to chase after the carrier/primary healing targets then try to re set up, or more likely 2) your going to get jumped on immediately and knocked back into the pit, where without a gap closer you are truly useless.  Kolto probes are the go too.  And I disagree with anyone that says you stack it only on the tank and yourself.  
I throw a kolto probe on most of the targets I can hit in range.  Since it doesn't cast it makes you very hard to pull out of a crowd as a healer, not to mention the TA's.  TA's are the endgame **ALWAYS** with a free heal, and the ability to keep people up indefinitely below 30% they make you not only unbelievably mobile, but basically invincible.  Plus the 3/6% healing bonus is clutch.  The way I have learned to play a pvp operative healer is staying in the pack.  Run with your group, stay in the fighting, and don't be a baby.  You can take damage your a healer for christs sake just stack 2 KP's on yourself and keep rolling.  Staying in the pack also makes RN useful a powerful ability to keep both you and your melee team mates alive.  The other benefit of being in the pack is you can shiv/backstab for damage AND extra TA's.
For those of you keeping record that means even if your 5 KP stacks on allies dont give you a TA you can always shiv for a TA.  All those TA's mean keeping up your stim pack at all times not to mention the fact that not only will you heal but actually do damage.  In my rotation I only hit Kolto Injection if I have a tank/ball carrier below 70% or my energy is &gt;80%   In my experience I have found that keeping your KP's stacks up is an efficient way to maintain health pools while keeping your energy full and your TA's stocked.  In an oh shit situation (ball carrier dropping) I tend to use a Injection/infusion combo for quick heals.  
As an operative healer I use my KP's to heal, I stay with the Pack keep RN up and in an oh shit scenario you I have Kolto injection/infusion to keep me safe, staying in the pack makes you hard to target and easy to distract enemies
The shortage of hard science guys is an area fraught with misunderstanding and misinformation. I will address STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math). 
**For the point, skip down to the next bold text**
We actually have surpluses of the STEM graduates in the USA. But a few areas are badly hurt because of the composition of our STEM workforce. In basic research, upper-level positions don't move much (people live longer, and the baby boomers occupy many of the top positions, and won't be leaving them any time soon, and many older researchers possess skills that aren't easily replaced or taught, such as methodologies for - say - cell culturing). Tenure becomes all but impossible to get, and professorships are risky propositions for professional post-docs who can make 60k+ per year doing reliably available lab work for someone else. Relatively speaking, it's worse for a physicist than it is for a biologist or chemist right now. 
Engineers are always in demand, but even this is misleading. The US has a surplus of engineers in it! But certain areas face major deficits, or only narrowly meet demand. The best examples are military. Sensitive projects that meet national defense requirements cannot have foreign nationals working on them for security reasons. This means the Navy (I choose it because it does a tremendous amount of advanced research and engineering) doesn't have enough US born engineers and scientists to reliably meet its needs. 
Why is this? Well, the US imports the best and brightest minds from around the world. The top graduates of India and China come here, and they often stay here because the quality of life is so much better. This presents three problems. First, it's cheap labor that de-incentivizes native US graduates from entering the engineering fields. Secondly, the US is less able to keep these people here anymore, and we're seeing a slow decline in available top students from other countries (this is partially a brain-drain phenomena, and partially a lack of interest in coming to the US). Thirdly, we find that foreign STEM graduates often lack the interest or ability to enter the higher levels of STEM fields. 
This phenomena seems to be related to cultural and linguistic factors. The cultural factors are two-fold: most US graduates will not work as hard as foreigners, and certainly not for as little compensation. Secondly, many foreign graduates rely on rote training (programs of learning common in Asia in particular, where "high school" on up focuses on rote methods). A major problem we have is that our foreign graduates do not innovate and lack initiative to strike out on their own research and projects. Also, if you've ever spent any time working in a large research lab, you may notice that the ethnic groups tend to cluster together. Many foreign graduates do not speak English (or even Spanish) competently in a work setting, and they often don't make the effort to learn.
**Now, there's a whole barrel of nuances and issues here that I didn't bother mentioning, because I want to move on to the point:**
Hard science (and math) is seen as reflecting an ability to think critically above and beyond that of most people, like English majors or political science majors. This is probably unfair, but there is definitely a deficit of people who have developed hard (quantitative) analysis skills. A premium is paid for them, and US science graduates can get incredibly lucrative jobs on Wall Street that offer inordinate rewards relative to the effort put in, and help pay down that school debt many carry. This is, in part, related to degree inflation as well. Firms that would've taken a liberal arts major in the seventies may well rule them out now (maybe all schools should go to a bell curve distribution for grades, and stick C as the 50^th percentile, hah).
It's not a lack of these people that's hurting us, it's that appropriate compensation and opportunity aren't available to the ones who choose to stay in the hard sciences. I doubt we'll see much change in this until the US is seriously competing with China, India and Europe to do the real, innovative and influential research (hint: China and India are not doing much meaningful research yet, but they're doing a hell of a lot more than they were 15 years ago). 
** There isn't really a deficit of hard science people in the US, but there is a deficit of US born hard science people in the US. Serious issues make this a difficult problem to address effectively.**
Only things i'm extremely attached to.
For example, my grandfather lent me his [sports car]( when I was in dire need of transportation - later for my 24th birthday, he sent me the title and said, "It's yours." I love my grandfather despite the two of us not having the closest relationship, so this was a big thing for me.
 Unfortunately, about six months later, it was totaled in an accident involving an old man driving out into traffic right in front of me. Despite the damage, I was able to drive it the remaining block home. 
The day the car was to be towed away, I went out to clean it out, and left the key in to listen to the radio. Just as I was finishing up, a series of characters from movies and TV all said goodbye. On the last goodbye, I took the key out for the last time, patted my car, and shed a tear as I walked back up to my apartment.
I know it was just the sign-off clip the morning radio show plays every morning at 10am, but I couldn't help think the timing was too perfect, and that my car was really saying goodbye for the last time, a la Bumblebee from the Transformers movies.
**** My totaled car said goodbye to me through the radio when I was preparing it for the tow truck for the last time.
I have two. One's in university now, youngest is finishing high school this year.
Exposed them to every religion that was practical to do. They liked the Buddhist monastery very much, but they happened to be going through a bit of a kung-fu phase so that might have played into it. Anglicans had the best snacks.
My youngest is essentially an apatheist. My eldest is a strong atheist, which is a more extreme position than I have (agnostic atheist when pressed, apatheist when left alone) but he's at that age where he's got more balls than brains so I expect his stance will moderate over time.
(Edit: in case you were wondering, we were living in Vancouver at the time and there's a broad and eclectic collection of mosques, temples etc all more or less within an hour's drive. Even scientologists, creepy fucks that they are. This approach may not work very well if you're not living in a religiously diverse community and all you can show your kids are various flavors of protestants.)
**TL/DR:** I didn't teach them to be atheists, but they ended up that way after being exposed to a bunch of different religions and realizing they're all a bunch of nonsense stories, even though they have cool aspects to them.
Several customers at the Pita Pit I work at used to creep on me regularly. 
1. Homeless Jake: Asked all of my coworkers the best way to ask me on a date. Didn't end up asking me out, but DID give me several gifts, including: A Monster energy drink, a bag of pretzel M&amp;Ms, and a chunk of brown quartz.
2. The Smelly Penguin: This guy [definitely a homeless drug addict] came in on two occasions. On the first, he asked for my phone number, told me I had nice teeth, and proceeded to lewdly stick his finger in his mouth. The SECOND time, he drops something on the counter near me. I look close and see that it's a small pebble. He say to me, "You know. Penguins give pebbles to their girlfriends as signs of affection."
** ROMANCE**
This was back in the mid 90's, I was working at Woolworth's at the mall, in the electronics/music/movie section. It was right around the time the movie Twister was out in theaters, and apparently The Family Channel made a quick knock-off called "Night of the Twisters" to cash in. The next day a rather notorious family came into my store, I'd heard about them from other employees and my girlfriend who worked at FYE but this was my first time dealing with them.  
  
These people apparently would come down from the hills of rural Pennsylvania in their rusted out pickup truck about once a month to do their shopping. The first thing I noticed was that I could smell them before I saw them. The son was a huge lumbering dude, probably about 20, wearing dirty overalls with no shirt, and just sort of staring at everything and everyone with dead eyes. The father was a older guy with an unkempt beard and a mean look on his face that suggested that he trusted no-one in the civilized world and would pull out his trusty 12-gauge if you crossed him. There were at least 2 younger kids running around but I don't really remember them.  
  
And then there was Granny. I assume she was the mother of the big kid and wife of the man, but with this family it's hard to say. She marched up to me with her crazy shock of white hair and opened her toothless mouth, pointing a finger accusingly,  
Her: "You got Night of the Twisters?!"  
Me: "Um, you mean, Twister, the movie that's out now? It'll be on video this fall probab-"  
Her: "NO! It ain't Twister! Night of the Twisters!"  
Me: "I've never heard-"  
(then the man joins in, looking like he's going to rip my head off if I say the wrong thing)  
Him: "Yeah, Night of the Twisters, we saw it last night, you got it, boy?"(in the way that only crazy old guys from the south can say "boy")  
At this point I felt like if I didn't produce this video tape, they were going to have Junior make me squeal like a piggy right in the middle of the store.  
Me: "If it was on last night, um... it might be a little while before it comes out on tape, um... I could take your name and give you a call if we get it....?"  
Her: "NO! It ain't worth it! Let's try another store!"  
  
And with that, they stomped out, the old man glaring at me as they walked back into the mall. Later I found out that they pulled the same routine at my girlfriend's store about 15 minutes before they came into mine.  
  
** Hillbilly family comes in to my store looking for a made-for-tv movie that aired the night before, gets angry when we don't have it.**
I worked as a Dominos delivery driver last summer. Our town is kinda known for being a little on the "ghetto" side. On the first night I worked, I had to go to the worst part of town for my last delivery. It must have been around 12:45 or so. I get to the place, go up to the third floor and ring the bell. Big DMX-looking guy opens the door in a wifebeater, givin' me the mean grills the whole time. I hand him the pizza, and he's looking around nonstop. He goes to get his money, stops as he's counting it, looks me dead in the eyes and says, "did anyone see you come up here?" I looked around at the silent summer night and told him I didn't think so. He smiles and says "Aiight my dude, they always be watchin' me. Thanks for bringing mah extra dippin sauces, otha dudes always be forgettin" He ended up giving me a 12 dollar tip, one of the best I ever received. He must have been on probation for pizza related crimes or something. Poor guy. ** DMX is a pizza molester, but he tips well if you bring him his dippin sauces**
Worked at a retail office supply store.  Some sketchy looking feller in his 30s or 40s comes in and asks me for something.  I don't remember the exact wording but it was something in a spray can and it turned cold.  
I worked in the computer section and it wasn't anything I had heard of so I got an associate from the office supply section.  We look around and the only spray cans we can find are spray glue.  The sketchy looking guy looks over the can a minute and buys a couple.
Later on I realize he was looking for canned air, as when you spray it, the can turns cold.  I also later learned that people were using the stuff to get high, a fact that forced us to start asking for ID when buying the stuff.
So anyways, we accidentally sold him the glue, which if he tried to inhale probably would have done some heavy damage to his airways if not killed him instead of just slowly killing off his brain.
**TLDR**
Accidentally sold a guy a can of spray glue that could have killed him.
When I was 16 I was working at a dog boarding kennel and liked to work with the dogs being boarded that were not taking the adjustment well. One of the dogs was a cute german shepherd who was cage aggressive, shy and terrified. I spent the week working with her and gave her owner a detailed report when he picked her up along with a few pictures of her playing outside with me. All was fine, he paid then left. Turns out he called back the next day to find out my name, ok no big deal. He then asked for my number so he could talk a bit more about his dog, of course a coworker gave it to him. He sent me a text introducing himself and asking about his dog, I thought this was normal so I responded. He then asked me to join him for dinner so we could keep talking, I said thank you but I am only 16. He responded along the lines of: hey that means you are legal! He was in his late 30s at this point, I declined again and requested to keep our discussions professional only then turned my phone off. This lead to him sending me a lot of text messages, calling me, and showing up to the kennel to chat/ask my coworkers about me. I got worried and talked to a few other customers that I knew pretty well abut what to do. Two of my favorite customers were partners in the k9 unit of the local police and they were kind enough to have a chat with the guy. I do not know what they said but he left me alone after that. 
- 16 year old girl gets stalked by late 30s guy after taking care of his dog
I've witnessed people getting high off of compressed air, it's not a myth.  The one guy in question proceeded to go out to buy more, driving on his own.  He then went around 100mph and crashed into a telephone pole.  He walked back to the house with blood and bits of safety glass all over him.  He was arrested in the next day or so and is going to be in jail for several years.
You're a dumbass and a stuck up prick. :3
I worked at Dominos as a delivery driver once and had to deliver a pizza to this customer in the ghetto. When I arrived at the house I discovered that it looked abandoned. It was late and there were no lights on anywhere and the yard was overgrown with weeds and bushes. Cautiously, I approached the front door with one hand on my Maglight so I could bash anybody that jumped out. I knocked on the door and a voice yelled out "WHO DAT?" I said "Dominos" and the door began to open. The chain was latched and a hand stuck out a crumbled up $20 bill ($19.89 order) and I said "thanks let me give you your change." The hand was still sticking out of the door and did a thumbs down which I assumed meant no change necessary. Confused, I said "can you open the door so I can give you the pizza?" (Chain still latched) The hand responded by twisting in a sideways motion. "You want me to turn the pizza on it's side and slip it through the door?" I remarked. Thumbs up replied the hand. So I turned the pizza sideways, heard all the toppings tumble off of the pizza and slipped it through the door like delivering mail. The hand appreciated it.** I delivered a pizza to a hand once.**
I'm 17 and i work in M&amp;S in England (Like a posh(ish) clothes/homeware/food store)
I was on the tills in the food section and a guy comes over to buy some flowers and a newspaper, he starts flirting with me (I'm a guy btw), really freaking me the fuck out as he's twice my age at least. He asks me if I'm "Mesmerized at his beauty" to which i just looked away and gave a slight "uh.. what?" chuckle. He then asks for cashback when paying with card, and as i hand him the receipt and a pen for him to sign acknowledging the fact he's received his money, he strokes my hand, followed by a wink just before he left the store.
**Got seriously hit on by a homosexual guy who was at least twice my age**
This is probably late but here goes: 
I was working at a McDonald's at the time and I was on cleaning duty. I started cleaning the customer area when I noticed and older man sleeping. I proceeded to wake him up and asked him to leave. He looked homeless and smelled really bad. I went on cleaning and came back 10 minutes later to find him still asleep. I got my manager to go wake him. After awhile we go the police involved. They tried to find his wallet and found a bottle of rum and a hospital bracelet instead. So now we have a drunk hospital escapee on our hands who can barely walk and fought with the policemen. He then pissed on the floor and left. I had to clean it up.
 Drunk hospital escapee slept in McDonald's, pissed on floor. 
It's sad I know where this is from...
 Too much Reddit :(
I work at a local grocery store. A customer would come in every Sunday and buy a single newspaper, yet would stand and talk to me for up to ten minutes. He was an older guy who at first I suspected just needed someone to talk to and whatnot. Every week he seemed to get more and more comfortable with me asking me of my hobbies, interests etc. One day he asked me if I had watched some pretty crazy moment in golf that was airing all over tv, and not really hearing what he said I told him I had. From that day forward he began asking me if i'd wanna play golf sometime and asked me for my cell phone number. I was freaked out and gave him my friends' and told him to not answer any numbers he didn't know. He called and called and the next Sunday he asked why I had been ignoring his calls and I said it must have been the wrong number. He then said "Ah well, guess i'll just ask you in person then. Would you wanna sleep over sometime, get to know each other a little bit? I have a feeling we'd make great friends. Come on, whadda'ya say?" 
I told him I'd be right back, called my manager and had him kick his ass out of the store. He ripped him a new one and the man has not come back since.
Man kept coming into grocery store, soliciting that I sleep over his house. Manager kicked him out.
When I was 16 or so I worked at a grocery store, and was approached by the mother of a guy in his mid-late 20's to tell me that her son thought I was beautiful, and he's really a nice boy and basically she just played him up in a creepy mom x wingman fashion. I awkwardly said "thanks, but no thanks," and walked away... as I was walking to the back room, I was intercepted by the son (fun fact: he was in a batman t-shirt) and he basically reiterated what his mother said.. he thought I was attractive and he would love to take me to dinner or for drinks. At 16, I was absolutely flustered and declined/ran away. Forgot about it, for the most part.
Fast forward 2 or so years, I had moved jobs to work retail at a women's shoe store. CREEPY GUY AND HIS MOM COME IN, I run into the back room to avoid being seen, explained the situation to my coworkers and they told me when the coast was clear so I could come back to the storefront. 10 minutes later, creepy guy returns (IN THE BATMAN SHIRT!) and catches me off guard - shakes my hand, says he remembers me, tells me I look better in this outfit than I did in my old uniform, and asks "if time has changed anything" .......... no. no it has not, sir and his mom.

**TL; DR** Hit on by older guy and his mom, and again 2 years later at different place of employment.
I had a homeboy who inhaled the stuff you use to clean keyboards, duster I think he called it anyway when he was doing it his high would last like a minute between hits and when he was high all he did was mumble and drool. I think at one point he fell and almost hit his head on some stairs so that's when I hid the bottle.
Don't inhale that sh*t you don't look cool and you could get hurt.
I used to work at a retail store that made you wear name tags, and I have a pretty unique name. Like there are very few people who have my name in the UK. So this customer comes in, stares at my name tag, and asks me a few questions regarding books and magazines (where I worked). Every sentence that he said to me ended with my name.. but not in a friendly way.. in a REALLY creepy way. So the conversation was something like this "Hello, you have a beautiful name, dailybunny" "Could you tell me where I can find this book, dailybunny" "Are you a student, dailybunny" "Where abouts do you live, dailybunny?" "How long have you been working here, dailybunny. I haven't seen you around here often" etc. I find it weird people using my name who don't really know me, but it was company policy to wear my nametag and I hated it so much. He kept staring at my name tag (could have been my boobs, I was never too sure) and as he was on his way out he put his hand on my hip and told me he was going to stalk me on Facebook. Needless to say as soon as I got home I changed my privacy settings.. still gives me the creeps when I think about it
creepy customer overused my name then told me he was going to stalk me on facebook
My aunt and uncle used to have a large trampoline in their backyard. Summers were spent with me and my cousins doing sweet backflips all day every day. No serious injuries ever.
One  night two kids from the neighborhood broke into my aunt and uncles backyard (latched gate) and started horsing around on the trampoline. One of the kids was jumping, flew off the thin and broke his leg. The next day my aunt and uncle get a call (they didn't know this had happened) saying they're being sued by the kids family. The next day there was no more trampoline at my aunt and uncles house. Saddest day of my life.
- aunt and uncle had trampoline, neighborhood kids broke into backyard, one broke his leg and the kids parents sued my aunt and uncle
When I was in 7th grade, I was a level 5 gymnast, and one time I was just having fun flipping on the tramp, and one of my buddies decided to double-bounce me (which is jumping on the tramp at just the right time to give the other person a HUGE bounce), and it rocketed me like 25 feet in the air, flipping uncontrollably. I landed on 3 layers of pads, but on the back of my neck, with all my bodies weight...luckily I was a really skinny kid, so my neck didn't snap, but my chin came down and slammed into my chest and dislocated three ribs. I couldn't breathe for like 3 minutes. It was utterly terrifying, I thought I was dead. I quit gymnastics after that....
landed on my neck off tramp, chin knocked out three ribs.
on the other hand... when i was ~10 years old i used to do chain backflips and i never hurt myself.... not even once... im also physically inclined and extremely agile/athletic though
my brothers and i had an awesome time on our trampoline and nobody got hurt
Most people simply remember the fumbled snap from his rookie year (or 2nd year?) and think omg he's not clutch. It also doesn't help that he's the leader of "America's Team" and is in scrutiny much more than he normally would. It's also natural to blame a QB for a team's loss, regardless of what actually happened. I can't even count the number of times I had to defend Rodgers from retards saying he choked in [this game](
Casual fans also seem to think that big spending = better team, and since Jerry Jones is pretty much the Steinbrenner equivalent in the NFL, people think that the Cowboys should be absolutely amazing in every aspect, so when they falter it's natural to blame their leader.
"Fuck the Cowboys" doesn't exactly help his cause either
 only casual fans who regurgitate ESPN's bullshit really believe that he's unclutch and/or sucks in the 4th quarter 
&gt; Any other indie devs out there thinking about this?
Yep. Have been working on a project myself recently and am a little unsure as to where to post things. But I decided not to post it at all until I've got more to show. Anyway, my thoughts on where to post what:
If you look in the sidebar, you'll see in big bold letters, "**WE HAVE A NO BLOGSPAM POLICY**". So basically, don't post a link here every time you blog.
Until now I wasn't aware of [/r/devblogs](/r/devblogs) but that seems an appropriate place to post when you make a new blog post. 
[/r/gamedev](/r/gamedev) would be for general game development, not necessarily blog posts, but largely seems to be made up of developers asking for advice from other developers. May or may not be helpful to you, Organ Trail is already a full game (unless I missed something, and quite a good one I might add, I played a while ago).
[/r/indiegaming](/r/indiegaming) would probably be the best place to post an announcement of a new release, whether it be a demo, full game, or new verion (e.g. release of an iOS/Android/PC/Mac version of Organ Trail). Also people here on [/r/indiegaming](/r/indiegaming) like links to cool games, whether they be new releases, classic gems, or anything you feel is worth more people playing.
As for x-posting, usually people will only do that on two subreddits when they can't decide between them. I've never seen a three-or-more-subreddit x-post (not saying you can't, I don't know). For example, let's say I've started a new development blog. I might post a link to it on [/r/devblogs](/r/devblogs) and x-post it over to [/r/indiegaming](/r/indiegaming). Or perhaps you're updating your game, you might post about it [/r/organtrail](/r/organtrail) and x-post that here. Generally just try to find the one most appropriate subreddit though.
x-posting is cool, but just try to find the most appropriate subreddit and maybe x-post it to one other subreddit. The three you linked to are for very different things, read their sidebars for information.
I do understand how it slips, and most of the time I ahve other things to worry about.  But yeah I do get offended.  Let me share a story.  My bosses are both very conservative, however, they have no problem with me being gay.  So lady boss was always saying "that's GAY," and then gave me shifty nervous eyes like I'm a whit elephant in the room.  Or a pink elephant.  With glitter.  Anyway.  One day was kind of rough for me, and at a meeting, the question was asked, "Why didn't So-and-so buy the product?" She said, "Cuz he's GAY," and then gave me the shifty nervous eyes.  I put down my pen and notepaper and looked her square in the eye and told her, "you have to quit saying that."  Man boss told me to quit being so sensitive, and I said, "You'd be sensitive too if you were walking home one night and some guy beats the shit out of you because he correctly perceived that you're gay, all the while hurling gay insults to you."  Then I turned to lady boss and said, "Every time you say that around your kids, you're normalizing to them that it's okay look down at people, to make fun of them, because they're gay."  So that was that.  They've never said it again.  
 yes, I do usually get offended.  Can't help it.
This is more or less the of everything on Seddit
I'm pretty sure the math was done on this subreddit and in terms of raw damage over like 10 seconds, Vayne was #1 and then Twitch and Kog.
Bear in mind that Trist's Q only has a 35% uptime. After those 7 seconds she's doing pretty average damage because she has no other steroids. Her other spells are negligible in terms of damage, and are there solely for utility by endgame.
A champion like Vayne has 12 seconds on her ult, true damage that's strong at all stages of the game, an auto attack reset that repositions and gives 50% more damage on a super low cooldown, and a situational stun.
I'm neglecting to mention the two things that make her really strong. Her range, and the utility of her Rocket Jump and Ultimate. I believe that the reason people don't pick Trist is because they can just pick Kog'Maw and have a much stronger mid game which can snowball you to late game during which you'll most likely do more damage. The percent health shred on Kog is really good all game, his mid game is really strong because of it, and he has more range than Trist with 47% uptime. Giving him blue, which is more feasible than giving Trist blue because of the spammable nature of his spells, the uptime is about 58%. In addition, mathematically Kog is stronger in the 8 seconds of Bio Arcane Barrage than Trist is during the 7 seconds of Rapid Fire. 
Now yes, Trist will maintain her 700 range after Rapid Fire ends, and Kog will go back down to 500 range when Bio Arcane Barrage ends, so after 8 seconds Trist has the advantage. The idea is that he'll do so much damage in those 8 seconds that it's worth it to pick him over Trist.
Also, upon looking at [this document]( again, and looking at slide 56 which looks at damage over the course of 10 seconds of all AD carries including all of their steroids, passives, and other buffs, it's pretty clear why you'd take Kog'Maw over Tristana. It's really quite interesting to see Tristana so low. I'm not surprised about the top 3 being Vayne, Kog, and Twitch, but it was surprising to see Miss Fortune and Sivir higher than Trist by level 18. I assume it's because of MF's impure shots passive, and Sivir's ultimate outlasting Rapid Fire. Also, I think this was from two months ago, so Sivir's ult may have been nerfed after this was released.
**** Kog does almost everything Trist does, but better. More overall damage, more range, only lacks the utility of Rocket Jump and Buster Shot, but makes up for it with all of his other qualities and has decent utility with Void Ooze.
A year or two ago, I was playing video games into the wee hours of the night. As it was a gorgeous summer night, I decided to take a break and go look at the night sky from my window and breathe in some fresh air. 
As I am standing there, feeling philosophical and shit, I see a pack of stray dogs running down my street. 
"Aww, look at that little puppy family" I think.
The dogs suddenly stop and start sniffing about the tall grass and bushes that grow across my house. One of them charges in and after some rustling and a mysterious cracking sound, he emerges with something in his mouth.
"What is that, a rat?" I think, horrified. I lean out my window, trying to get a better look.  Meanwhile, the dog happily lies down on my neighbour's lawn and pants for a bit, leaving his prey between his paws.
That's when I realise that he didn't kill a rat. He'd killed a kitten.
My jaw dropped as I watched that dog **eat** that poor kitten. After he'd eaten it, the whole pack just went on their merry way, leaving me scarred for life. I still feel bad for not being able to stop it in time.
**Helplessly watched a stray dog eat a kitten from my bedroom window.**
This is probably really tame, but I've yet to find a good place to post this story.
One beautiful day a few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were enjoying some time people watching at the park. Sitting on a bench, we notice a cute little boy chasing a duck that had wandered a way from the pond. We watched them for a good ten minutes had a pretty good laugh, then up and left to walk nearer the water. We find another bench with a group of ducks swimming nearby and sit there for awhile. Not too long after, we hear the little kid behind us. Sure enough, he was still chasing the scared waddling duck. We laughed again and turned around to watch how things would turn out. I hear the park's old passenger train not too far in the distance. I get a feeling things are going to take a turn for the worse. At this moment, the boy, his mother, and 3 brothers had caught up with him, all watching this little boy trying to catch this poor duck. The train approaches... The nearest track is less than 5 feet from our bench, and about 10 feet from the kid and the duck. The boy stops short of the tracks, but the duck keeps waddling. We all gasp as the duck tries to cross in front of the train(which is going painfully slow) and gets completely crushed in front of all of us. I screamed, as did the little boy. The poor duck survives and frantically tries to escape from under the train but only gets repeatedly run over the the wheels, crushing his wings, neck, and feet. The train passes and the duck hobbles off the track barely alive. He's bleeding, can hardly walk, and has a wing that was broken into a disturbing angle wings are not meant to bend in. None of us know what to do so we all stand there and watch. He manages to make it near a bush that is a couple of feet from the water. Three ducks immediately come on the land and approach him. "Aw look! The ducks are coming to help him!" NOPE. All three of the ducks take turns pecking at his face and initiate a gang bang. At one point he had all three of the ducks mounting his limp body at the same time. The boys and their mother are so shocked and disgusted that most of them run away covering their faces. We find a park ranger to tell him about the wounded duck and where the gang banging was happening but he said there wasn't much we could do to help it. We walked away from the duck area with our heads hung low and a gloomy cloud over the rest of the day. It was a brutal display of nature's dealings with death.

**boy chases duck, duck gets hit by a train, and is gangbanged by a group of ducks as he lays dying, with a group of people watching it all happen.**
Edit: spelling and wording.
A guy came to our school last year to talk about 9/11 and how he was one of the firefighters who worked there.  Any way he showed us videos and pictures of the aftermath and stuff like that.  The most disturbing things I saw where that day, he showed us a video of a lady running out and all the skin from her arms was burned off.  As if that wasn't bad enough there was a picture of a dead guy sitting up against a cop car with lots of skin missing..... I will never forget the way his eyes looked. 
 I saw a video of a lady with no skin on her arms run from the world trade center and a picture of dead guy with severe burns all over his body 
The first disturbing thing I ever saw.
I was with a friend of mine parents driving on a busy main road in my home city. It was about 5pm, so rush hour. I was watching this guy for about 100 metres trying to cross the road. It was really really busy and I could tell he was getting frustrated. As our car got up to where he was we stopped with the traffic, he passed behind our car and decided that this was the time to cross. The traffic on the other side was moving a lot faster as it was leading towards the city center. As he got out from behind our car he was smashed by a hatchback at about 60kph. He must've flipped about 4 or 5 times before landing a metre from a parked car. His shoes were thrown up to the second floor of the closest building. He was crying and moaning with blood just pouring from his head, face, neck and stomach. Everyone got out of their cars and stood watching/calling ambulances, no-one really went to help. The reason behind this was that people were scared of getting AIDS (this was in Africa). I was a kid so i wasn't gonna do shit. It was messed up, i still remember his face just looking straight at us screaming for help.
About a week or two later I was in the McDonalds drive through with my dad, as we left the DT lane i saw the same guy being wheeled out on a wheelchair to the same car that him by the driver of that car. There was still a dent on the car from the damage the collision caused. He was munching on a Maccas meal with a bright fluoro raincoat on. I guess the driver wanted to apologize. 
**Guy gets hit by car, gets McDonalds**
You know, I know I've seen worse, but Ima post something not car-wrecky. 
I was 14 in 2002 (foreshadowing: ALL FEAR THE RIAA) some kid I didn't like was desperate to be my friend and gave me three burned CDs: Godsmack (Meh) Nickelback (Blech) PoD (Worse than Nickelback - seriously).
Anyhow, after listening to Godsmack, I went ahead and put Nickelback in the CD player (blow me). It didn't play. For some reason, the following thought process occurred to me: "It won't play because it has data on it. That data HAS to be porn! I HAVE PORN!"
As a porn-deprived young man, I was very excited at this prospect, and guess what? There was more than 200 videos! 
Each video looked like it was poorly shot in some previous, forgotten decade. After seeing and immediately closing a couple of videos of granny porn, I scrolled down more and found the kiddie porn. It was the one of the ten-year-old schoolgirl being forced to suck some low-rent Ron Jeremy's dick that I shut down my computer, removed the disc and broke it into several pieces.
Now, the reason I never contacted the FBI or the police? Well shit man, I had a BURNED CD! My ass isn't going to jail just so this kid's pervert brother (or himself) can go to jail too. 14-year-old logic is stupid, but it was 2002 and rumors were floating that people were going to jail for burned CDs.
Also, I literally can't even remember the kid's name, so I can't find out if he or his brother went to jail later in life.
- I learned that there can be something worse on a Nickelback CD than Nickelback.
When I was younger my family and I lived in South Africa for a period of about 3 years. As my parents were both avid horse riders they chose to inflict their equistarian adventures on us as well. Eager as we were to see all the wonderful African wildlife we decided to combine the two. Yeah...not the genius idea we initially thought it was.
Cut to us standing shocked and covered from head to toe in horse blood next to what had previously been a horse while our gung-ho local horse guide shouts frantically into a walkie-talkie. So what happened? Well turns out our trusty local wasn't quite the experienced outdoorsman he had convinced us he was. As we had ridden into the rising African sun, we had come accross a herd of wild [wildebeest]( Now if you've never seen a wildebeest, they're about 70% neck muscles and 30% horns and hellfire. Although they're not the most dangerous or aggressive animals out there, you do *not* want to fuck with them.
As we ride past the wildebeest the guide takes us a little closer than we felt was strictly necesarry. In defense of their territory and young the alpha male trots over to ward us off, stamping the ground, shaking his head and generally making it pretty clear he wants us to leave. Being the animal-whisperer he is our trusty guide decides that this is the time to assert his dominance. I believe "showing them who's boss" were his exact words. From his saddlebag he retrieves a *slingshot*, now a slingshot hurts, but to to one of these horned motherfuckers a slingshot is *nothing*. He precedes to shoot the wildebeest from a distance of about 5 meters (yeah, I'm european) in the face half a dozen times, which only serves to anger him. 
Deciding to finish this once and for all our guide pulls out his *riding crop*, and I shit you not, rides over and starts wailing on the wildebeest with it from horseback. Shocked we watch as the now pretty pissed off animal charges forward, spits the horse on its horns (puncturing a main arterie under the front leg and ripping open its stomach), lifts the horse and rider into the air, before it slams them into the ground and runs away. The horse rises shakily to its feet and stands there uncertainly for a few seconds. Then the blood starts pouring, or rather pumping. In seconds gallons and gallons of blood are running over the dry African dirt. As it stands there its guts slowly begin to coil out of its opened stomach, while the horse sways gently. As our guide stands there in shock my family and I spend half an hour trying to keep it alive, lowering it slowly to the ground and trying to compress its wound. Half an hour later the poor thing is dead, and we are absolutely drenched in blood. The guide procedes to throw us off his land when we ask for our money back, and we drive home. We got some pretty weird looks when we stopped to buy some food, looking like the Manson family or some shit. The only redeeming side of this story was that while standing in line, caked in horse blood and dirt, we hear a police siren in the distance. My little sister goes into troll mode and exclaims: "Dad! They know we're here! Run!" The cashier nearly pissed herself.
**TL; DR: Slingshots are not wildebeest repellant.**
I was on a police ride a long and we got called to a dog shooting. When we arrived, I saw a dog walking around with a hole in his side. It looked like it was from a .22 handgun of some sort. Obviously the dog was still walking around with a hole in his side, but that wasn't even the worst. The worst was about 20ft away laying on the ground. A defenseless pit bull panting and whimpering in so much pain surrounded by blood and bleeding from every place on his body. The backyard was covered in blood which changed the idea of the .22. We now thought maybe the two dogs got in a fight, but once again, this idea was changed soon. 
The fence was kicked in, obviously to get to the dogs. When the officer went in front of the dog, the dogs teeth were completely kicked in. I couldn't bring myself to look at this dogs face knowing it was suffering this much. The officer then found the dog collar which was cut off. This dog was not shot and not only kicked, but attacked with a machete. Once animal control came on scene, they went to turn the dog over and his arm was practically hanging off. I walked back to the police car and looked back, just as animal control was putting this poor defenseless animal in the back of the van... And I just saw the face of this dog looking at me, obviously in severe pain. His teeth completely inward, cuts along his face and the eyes of a living creature begging for help. 
I knew it was disturbing but not the total effect if this situation until I went to the local pound some time after. There was a pit bull there and when I saw it, I immediately looked away and I couldn't bear to face it. It just totally disturbed me that someone could do that to an animal or any living creature. 
The aftermath of a dog mutilation, out of a horror movie, in real life. 
I saw a horse get its head knocked off by a pickup truck. The truck must have been doing 80 miles per hour down a rural highway and the horse just stepped out of the woods and hung its head out across the road. I was driving about 100 yards behind the truck, and saw the whole thing happen. At first I didn't even know what I was looking at. I just saw break lights come on and there was a large brown mass writhing in the road. As I got closer, I could see it was a horse, and the head had been COMPLETELY torn off. The neck was shooting blood like a fire hose. I'm talking a 20 foot gush that sprayed all over the side of my car as I drove past it. I got out to check on the driver and he was in shock, had no idea what had just happened. But the most horrifying part about the whole thing, the part that really made my stomach turn was the reactions of the other horses that were penned up across the street and had witnessed the whole thing. I've never seen animals that freaked out before in my life. They were screaming and bucking and tripping over one another. It was like they understood exactly what they had seen. I guess the dead horse was one of their friends that had somehow managed to escape from the pen. Anyway, I snapped a few cell phone pictures because I was sure that nobody would believe me when I told them about it. Also, I found the horse's head - it had been thrown about 60 feet away from the body in the ditch. I had nightmares about this whole ordeal for weeks afterwards. It was, by far, the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.
- Saw horse get head knocked off with guillotine precision by speeding pickup truck. Blood got all over my car. Afterwards, saw other horses hysterically grieving their dead friend.
I was around 9 or 10 and my dad was recovering from a triple bypass in ICU. Normally they don't allow children in but it was quite possibly the last chance I would see my father alive. As I was sitting in his little sectioned off area I could see the guy in the next little area over through and opening in the divider. From what I remember all the alarms on his monitors start sounding and doctors and nurses rush in. It'd all kind of a blur but I remember seeing blood spouting out of the guys chest and his dead body was carted out shortly after
watched a guy bleed out and die when I was a young child
You're overthinking this. You like her, she smiles and waves - that should be enough of a cue to initiate. Maybe that was her boyfriend but you won't know until you talk to her.
Don't ask about her boyfriend, just initiate a conversation and if it goes well after a while tell her you have to go and would love to continue this conversation over coffee/tea/lunch/a bed or whatever and if she's interested she'll say yes, if not she'll say no.

TL;DR
Just talk to her
It sounds like you have body dismorphic disorder. A classic symptom of BDD is anxiety and the belief that people are noticing your flaws, whether they are extreme or not. And you DO need therapy for this, it's not some simple self esteem issue that you can just make go away if you try hard enough, it's a legitimate psychological disorder. 
I think I may have mild BDD, for a while I didn't think I did because my situation didn't seem extreme enough to me to qualify (since my anxiety over my appearance has never actually prevented me from doing my daily activities) but I'm starting to think that I definitely do have at least a mild case of BDD. In my case, I logically know that I'm not fat, but I constantly look at myself and see a fat person. I'm not SKINNY, I have some pudge on my stomach and hips, but I know that I'm not actually fat. The thing is, I still believe I am. It's like there are 2 different parts of my brain, one part understands what I look like from a rational, logical stand point, but it can't convince the other part of my brain, which persists in believing that I'm fat and ugly. I often think when I go out in public that everyone is thinking about how fat I am. I obsess over what I eat, and if I miss the gym for one day my obsession gets worse and worse until I finally exercise.
 I know how you feel, and you need therapy. Health insurance often covers therapy, and if yours doesn't I'm sure you can find something you can afford. At least look.
The answer is simple: you're American. America is full of greedy corporations and the only thing on their agenda is to bend over a fuck the common man like ourselves. they would rather hire someone who went to a top college and doesn't have the "C's are degrees" attitude and that just disgusts me. 
If you want to escape all of this then simply move to Sweden. They'll have you set up with a 6 figure job the moment you cross the border and on top of that you'll have 34 weeks of paid vacation. 
 move to Sweden
Actually Sweden has of late been heavily influenced by the neo-fascist agenda from the United States as well. Since people stopped voting for the socialist utopian government we now have 80% unemployment, no health care and every single atom has been sold to foreign corporations.
 Sweden now sucks because the fascists shut down The Pirate Bay like a long time ago
Mine wasn't military, I wish it was. Instead it was just me being a complete idiot. I can't tell you how many times I've said/written " Don't get married at 20." Haha.
Loaded question.
No, I don't think "lesbian sex" should necessarily be threatening -- not because it's somehow less legitimate. I think there are different kinds of intimacy between men and women, women and women, and men and men; not at all more or less legitimate, but qualitatively different. So if I'm in a relationship with a girl, I'm going to expect to be a strong source of the male-female type of intimacy, but I can't expect to completely replace the female-female type of intimacy for somebody who's interested in that. Likewise, I wouldn't worry about being "replaced" by a girl, because obviously the girl I'm with already has an appetite for the male-female type of intimacy, which a girl wouldn't be able to completely replace either.
 Male-female intimacy and female-female intimacy, as far as I'm concerned, is apples to oranges.
&gt;I appreciate the eventual answer
And I sure do appreciate the condescending reply! 
Your question, at its core, is no different than the ones you were complaining about a few days ago.  They all fall into the same category - "I have this thing and I need some advice about wearing it!"  If you don't know whether your red shorts are versatile or not, then maybe you should reconsider whether you know how to wear them.  
- Think more next time, you fucking idiot.
&gt;Your question, at its core, is no different than the ones you were complaining about a few days ago. They all fall into the same category - "I have this thing and I need some advice about wearing it!"
Wait, so you're telling me that my PSA was about 'wow, I sure hate how people ask for clothing advice'?
Let me read you some of the main things in that thread:
* PSA: Stop buying random shit and **then immediately** asking MFA how to wear it.
* I think it's just incredibly stupid to buy something and to think on your way home, "Man, I can't wait to ask MFA how I can wear this!"
I bought these shorts days ago, have worn them out a couple of times, and I'm just asking if they're versatile for repeated wear. 
If I had bought them 10 minutes ago and posted on MFA on what to wear them with, how to wear them, and if they were versatile or not, then yes, I would be contradicting myself. But that is not the case.
I have nothing against people asking how to wear clothes, just people on MFA who randomly buy something, go home, and then start asking this community how to wear it without even trying to see what they can do.
So no, my question is different from the one I was complaining about a few days ago.
 maybe I'm not the idiot.
As some one who has worked on ebooks for the past few years and in publishing for the last 8 years I could not agree more. I have been saying since day one when I started working on ebooks that they are inflated for no particular reason other than publishers trying to increase profits off of a product that doesn't have nearly the production costs. There is no ink, no paper, no shipping, no plates, no warehouse fees. That is 50% of the wholesale price right there completely wiped out.
Prices can be cheaper, but there are costs that most people to not factor in due to a lack of knowledge of the publishing industry: there is a holdover model that has seeped into and dominated digital publishing and it's the same beast that killed print publishing: distributors. I should emphasize, lack of sales is not what killed print; it was mostly distribution. Publishers are still sending there files to a distributor who electronically validates them and sends them to the retailer. If you're thinking "WTF?!?" then I'm right there with you. Cut out the middle man and send your own fucking files. Just hire some people to do QA and send your book off to Amazon, Apple, Google Books, whoever.
Honestly, and this is coming from somebody who loves working on books, fuck publishing. These old publishing houses cannot get with it, the distribution is a fucked up system, and the dominant retailers are locking everyone into proprietary bullshit in order to gain a monopoly. This whole system has to be torn down and rebuilt by some people with some fucking vision, because you will not find it in the current publishing world. Start up your own fucking publisher: get an unemployable English major to edit your manuscript, hire a designer to make the shit look readable, hire a marketing person and sell it from your own damn site. Hell, if you can do all of that yourself and do it well, more power to you. DIY.
 Fuck publishing: the publishers, the distributors, and the retailers.
I like LaTeX the way it is. For the industry people, the issue is how it all feeds into the process. The author bit is pretty much just a word processor, but that feeds into a big versioning/revisions database, which in turn feeds into the layout system, which in turn feeds into the physical production system and the online system.
 The word processing part is a tiny part of the whole.
26yr T1, just completed a few rounds of laser treatments with a decent outcome so far. I avoided eye doctors for at least 8 years and could have been treated earlier but didn't.  My initial notice that something was wrong was after a flight from Orlando to New Orleans when I noticed my eye had partially filled with blood. Looked like a dangling piece of yarn that would move when I moved my eye. Real PITA when I had to drive home to Dallas from New Orleans due to full flights. I still have some debris/blood in my right eye from the initial bleed, but I'm' told that it should clear somewhat in the future and my vision is passable for driving and reading so I'm happy. 
The treatment can be very painful unless they numb everything with a lidocaine shot first. This shot will cause temporary blindness since the optic nerve stops working too, so be prepared for a day with minimal vision in that eye. I had a total of four separate treatments, two left, two right separated by a few months each. Each treatment only took about 15 minutes and I was driven home by my wife.
You will likely need surgery but it's not as bad as it sounds.
 The laser treatment is like kittens and cake after the shot that numbs the eye.
The SV650 is a great bike to start with and has more than enough pep within the legal limits. I had one I used as a daily driver and I never wanted for power, highways included. It tops out at ~130mph, so you have plenty of power for maneuvering or passing at highways speeds should you need it.
As far as finding one, look at the Ninja 650R (also called the ER-6F). It is similar to the SV650 (almost the same bike from a different maker) and is still being made. You can usually find them used for a good price. This is what I got after my SV was totaled, and it really is a very similar bike.
Both of these bikes have twin engines (the SV is a [v-twin]( the Ninja is a [parallel twin]( Twin engines have a much more linear power curve, and more low-end torque than [inline fours]( (most racing bikes). What this means practically is that the throttle is more predictable and you do not have to worry as much about keeping the engine revving in its sweet spot to get power. Very nice for a beginner. You can focus more on the basic skills of riding.
&gt; I'm super cautious and have never been in an accident *(that was caused by me)*, but at the same time I know that mistakes will be made. 
This is one thing that does need to change. In a car you have some luxury to worry primarily about your own driving. On a motorcycle any accident has the potential to be very serious, so you have to start taking responsibility for others driving too. Legally an accident may be the other driver's fault, but as a rider you are taking a higher risk. For your own sake you want to go above what is required legally to keep yourself safe. The accident that totaled my SV was not my fault, but if I had been a more experienced rider I could have avoided it (and have since).
&gt; I hope that going into this with the right attitude will keep me from making mistakes.
Sounds like you have already learned one of the big lessons in riding safely. :) You will definitely make mistakes, but having the humility to learn and ride within your limits will keep you from making serious mistakes.
**** Look at the Ninja 650R as well. Crashing is painful, regardless of fault. You'll do fine.
First thing you need to is go to the UNT police department and talk to a sergeant or lieutenant. Tell them your story, be respectful, don't say anything at all about the cop or how he's too stupid to do his job. Tell them that you are  almost certain you stopped, tell them about your balky suspension, and tell them that you gave him the wrong insurance papers because you were flustered because you've never been stopped before (that is correct, isn't it? Or do you have multiple tickets, in which case man up and pay the fines/take the driver's ed). Stress how broke you are. Cry if you have to. And you better be sincere.
If that is your first offense the odds are that he'll tear up the ticket. If that doesn't work, go to the judge and tell him the same thing. At all times stress that you're a poor-but-honest student and never--and never means don't even hint--that the cop is in any way to blame. Be polite even if you're pissed. If you get pissed and don't hide it, you're fucked. Turn your anger into self-pity and try to act like these tickets are the worst thing that ever happened to you.
 eat shit and save money.
Some quick numbers. $25 billion over 20 years, for the F-35s.
2006 data gives government contributions to CBC at $946 million, which is the latest data I could find from a reasonable source with a cursory google search. That means, over the same 20 year period, the CBC would have cost the government $18.9 billion. The Govt. cuts to CBC is $115 million a year, which brings the total cost down to $16.6 billion (net savings of $2.3 billion).
So, they're not quite the same costs, but they're certainly *much* more comparable than the picture makes it out to be. That said, it's my personal belief that the money is much, *much* better spent on the CBC.
**** 
* 20-Year F-35 cost: $25 billion
* 20-Year CBC cost (Pre-cut): $18.9 billion
* 20-Year CBC cost (Post-cut): $16.6 billion
* 20-Year Savings from Cut: $2.3 billion
Luck is a factor in all games and society in general. An element of randomness keeps things interesting. If you think you lost a game because one Void got a lucky bash on his first try, then the truth is you probably had a dozen fundamentally controllable opportunities to keep that from being the deciding factor. No single element is ever the sole reason for winning or losing, but randomness can create more unique experiences and memories.
For neutrals, I think there's a valid argument for creating more predictability in their spawns to improve jungling viability.
Runes are only as random as you let them be. With proper ward coverage the spawns and benefits of a rune become highly predictable. Take advantage of your resources (wards) to insulate yourself from getting ganked by a "lucky rune."
Randomness creates unique moments. Unique moments only beat you if you fail to take advantage of the game's many controllable elements.
Every aspect of the game that you mentioned contains variability, but it's up to a player and his teammates to play in a manner that drives the advantage given by such randomness in their favor.
For example, bash on Void has a 25% chance to proc. However that's not the end of the story. A void with MoM doesn't have the same chance to proc his bash as a void without MoM. You get IAS items to drive up your opportunities at achieving the 25%. If a void wants to go crit instead of IAS, that's totally acceptable. But the player has made a tactical choice to opt for criticals rather than the power to attack faster and use the availability of this 25% to his advantage.
The very heroes that you mention are very good reasons why an element of randomness should remain within the jungle. When you pick Chen instead of Enchantress, you are doing so with the understanding that you will not be able to dominate more than 1 creep at a time until level 5. The reason Enchantress was so popular to Na'Vi at one point was because she could dominate *two* as opposed to Chen's *one*. They were giving up Chen's other utilities to increase the chances that they could come out of the jungle at a very low level with a disabling creep (whether it was 1 of 2, or 2 of 2 dominated creeps.) In other words, actively shaping the game's randomness to favor their strategy.
Randomness also tests players. Will a darkseer that comes across a golem camp simply wait for someone else to kill it and lose out on more efficient jungling? (Having to walk around the camp everytime.) Or will he pull, stack, and choke point to give himself access to the resources presented by golems? The same can be said for the Doom. If the ideal X camp isn't readily available, what sort of creep will he pick up to optimize his capacity to tank, stun, slow, or mana drain.
Finally, I feel like runes **need** to be random. The simple fact that a player doesn't understand how or why a rune might hurt their lane or team drives them to pick it up/prevent the other team from grabbing it. When the enemy mid goes missing, compare how much incentive there is for a player and his side lanes to react if 1)he doesn't know whether it was top or bottom, whether it was a haste or invis or double damage, versus 2) he already knew it was an illusion rune top. A rune is far more dangerous to a team if they don't know what it is until it's being used on them. This danger is what drives team to fight so heavily over runes (and ultimately, what makes them integral to the game.)
**A team's ability to make randomness work in their favor is as much a skill as any other part of the game. Randomness also prompts a team to take preemptive steps to ensure that such randomness is not used against them.**
/r/lgbt mods - "oh, you have concerns about the fairness and possible double standards in our policies? LOL BYE."
&gt;It can be explained by any number of reasons.
It sure can. And those reasons are their own. You are suggesting the fact they want to not live life as a gay person is all attributable to societal pressure, when sometimes people *just don't want to be gay*. I'll avoid more anecdotes, and wont even challenge you to ask any gay people you know if they would have picked being gay if they were given the choice. 
I'm short. I've accepted it, that doesn't mean I need to *like* it or that society had any hand in why I don't like being short.
&gt;Now consider this in the context of a minority.
Sure... I'm going to go ahead and assume we are on the same page that homosexuality is natural, completely acceptable and the option of being homosexual should be a human right across the planet. Yes? Ok. Now lets pretend you are in a very liberal part of the country, where you are more likely to be chastised for being a homophobic bigot than for being gay. (Hello Soho!). Now if an individual that takes that all into account *still* wants to change, you're saying "You should like it and *want* to be gay!. So no, I, a person that knows nothing about you know what is best for you and if you don't like being gay, you must have unsupported parents or something"
&gt;rather, what people should be doing is helping others in accepting their nature. 
In your *opinion*. Some people just want to live their lives they way they choose, and if they choose to try and change that part of themselves who are you to tell them they cant? There are some people that are naturally a little overweight but you wouldn't think twice about helping them check out other options if they chose. 
 Leave the choice up to the individual. This is for the few gay people that don't *want* to be gay.
I came here to say something similar, and share my experience. The first and only time I ever went geocaching, I was stopped by cops in an alley behind my favorite cheesesteak joint. It was late at night and I was at a solid [7], thinking back on it now. My friend and I had just retrieved the cache, which was magnetically attached to an electrical box, and contained a plastic baggy with items in it. 
As we were checking the bag out, a cop drove around the corner and immediately hit us with his brights and spot light. we looked really stupid. We explained what geocaching was and he was pretty cool about the situation. He let us know that there had been a lot of robberies going on in this particular plaza, so cops were watching this alley. Then another unit rolled up from the other direction of the alley. That cop got out with somewhat of an attitude, looking at the scene thinking we were a couple of perps. I remember the first cop asking him, "Hey, do you know what Geocaching is?" and the other officer reacting like it was a new slang term or something. Geocaching was explained again. 
Then a K9 Unit arrives to the scene. This third officer was older and when he got out he was asked if he knew what Geocaching was. Surprisingly, he did. He said his granddaughter was into Geocaching. Everything was cool and as my friend and I were about to leave, yet 
*another* cop pulls up on a motorcycle. We just left at that point, and we continued to Geocache for the rest of the night. I recommend having fun while Geocaching, but you need to respect the community as well as the law.
**tl/dr** Went geocaching, attracted several cops. Keep it real.
Can you give me the version of that?
You're a good medic and you have nothing to apologize for. Just like pedobearface said, everyone was playing bad (even worse than usual lol) and the stars just weren't alligned for good play.
The thing with kritz is that it requires more 'finesse' and time/area management to be used successfully, because unlike with the uber, you can't just pop it and get the 'get out of battle free card', actually your chances of dying are much higher with it due to the fact that when used, people will target you with even more passion and a bombing soldier is not a pretty sight when you're kritzing a demoman (for neither of you). 
So, anyway, here are some noobtips:

1. Focus on someone to kritz. Usually the player will figure it out if you're pocketing him. If not, just spam READY FOR THE CHARGE HERR DOKTOR or something like that.
2. Take a few steps back (behind a wall/corner) and wait for your pocket to reload (80% of demoman play time is spent reloading so this can be a bitch and there's really no use to push with 2 stickies/rockets loaded).
3. Like Lord Maximus said, the queue for popping is "Go Go Go", this means pop it right at "Go Go Go", not earlier, not later. This means that the demoman will have his sticky loaded and prepared for release. First kritzsticky is THE most important imo because it catches the opponent stacked in one place and unprepared. After that, everyone just scatteres and runs around all over the place.
4. Your pocket may have a tendency to overextend, and believe me, every overjoyed kritzd demoman will just jump around like a bloody kangaroo thinking he's invincible but guess what... he's not... and there's really no point in following him if he overextends too much.
everyone sucks **(especially cpt srs)**
Case in point. I am an atheist, but really? Not all religions lead to willful ignorance. I was raised Jewish, but part of the reason I became an atheist was because I was encouraged to question my belief in god and to develop my own view. While I became an atheist many of my classmates did not, and thus they became educated but religious. Take the things you hear on /r/atheism with a grain of salt because at times they can be just as ignorant or hateful as many religious individuals they discuss. 
 yes, some religious individuals are willfully ignorant but that's the individual them-self, not the religion promoting it.
This is a really tough question.  I've always felt that the only true good is Love, and the only true evil is Hate.  These aren't really qualities, though.
I should first say what came to mind immediately.  Determination is one of the most admirable qualities I've seen, and there's nothing I can't stand more than Nihilist-for-the-sake-of-doing-nothing.  They seem to think it's really smart of them to do nothing all day, and get upset at people who ask small things of them.  This is not what Nihilism means, that's just being a lazy asshole.
However, I think I can come up with something better.  I remember a story my father told me when I was a wee lad, about a man whose name I have long since forgotten.  
&gt; When he was born, a fairy godmother appeared, and asked the parents what they would wish if they could have any wish for their child.  They said that they want him to be loved by everyone.  And so, she granted this wish.  As this boy grew up, his parents loved him and spoiled him, always getting him anything he wanted.  When he started school, everyone was vying for his friendship, and the teachers adored him.  He graduated doing no work and learning nothing, eventually getting into an Ivy League University, and was at the top of his class, even though he never opened a book his entire stay.
&gt; He spent all of his university years partying, and being with the most beautiful people on campus, because he could.  He could never screw up no matter how hard he should have failed.  He never felt any care for anything, and there was nothing tying him to his world.  One day, amid thoughts of depression and suicide, his fairy godmother once again visited him, and told him of his parents' wish.  She told him that he was now responsible to change the old wish to his own.
&gt; So, the young man wished that he could love.  Not some single love with one special person, but rather to feel true love for every person.  The fairy godmother smiled and granted the wish.  The young man suddenly felt a great happiness inside of him, and went outside, positively beaming at everyone.  "Hello, friends," he exclaimed.  They simply looked at him, wondering why he was being weird.
&gt; Within a week, he dropped out of school, and wound up on the street, as he had no skills to support himself with, and could no longer ride the wish.  So, every day he sat on a street corner, rattling a tin can, smiling a four-tooth smile at any passers-by, and even if one cursed at him, he forgave the stranger, who likely was just having a bad day, and imagined what a lovable being he was.  And when someone dropped even a dime into his cup, the joy he felt at the genuine compassion of someone he loved so would fill his body, and none in the world were ever so happy as this tenapenny hobo.
This story being told, I think that it is important to be able to love, while we also need people who can get shit done, or there won't be enough people to be loving.  Because a determined person can be narcissistic, and a loving person can be uncontributing, I need a word that combines both.  So, the feature I admire most, is Piety.  I don't mean that bible-bashing hicks who hate the gays are the best people.  I don't mean that Atheists are the worst.  To understand my answer, you need to understand that I do not mean the dictionary definition of Piety.  A Pious person is someone who is devoted to something greater than themselves, and has the humility and compassion to "love thy fellow man."  I have always wanted to go to India, as it is supposedly the most Pious place in the world.  People there are so poor and overpopulation is so rampant, that they need something else.  As a result, they have created many of the world's major religions (Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam all came from India IIRC), and worship greater virtues that extend beyond their own lives.  I believe that the Quintessential Indian loves his fellow man, and has a firm belief in a religion, that he spreads to other men, in order to give them the inner happiness he has found.  Because such things have spread so strongly in such a densely populated place, I want to cry with joy when I think of the great happiness this has brought to so freakin' many people!
Again, however, Piety is something more.  It's not just about being really devoted to the spreading of Religion, it's also about being really devoted to the spreading of Love.  I don't care if you're Christian, Sikh, Agnostic, or Atheistic, if you spend your life in a way that promoted love, then I love you.  You can use the Christian Doctrine to bring hope to people's dull lives, you can use Atheistic Rationality to bring the comfort and progress mankind needs to support our love, you can use the spare time you get from just deciding to be Agnostic to spread messages of peace and love, and your Piety will be your greatest triumph.
That being said, there is one thing that ruins Piety.  Only one thing in the world that can get in the way of a Utopic Society where we all are so loving that all can coexist in perfect harmony.  Bigotry.  Because when you are a bigot, you only love *some* people.  Unfortunately, your Bigotry is almost always associated with what you are most Pious towards.  In this way, you get those aforementioned Hicks being against anything that isn't distinctly mentioned as "okay" in their scripture, as well as Militant Atheists who will hate Piety in and of itself, instead of focusing on the Bigotry they actually hate.
By being a bigot, you can never appreciate the gesture of someone who is trying to extend their lovingness to you.  You certainly can live in luxury, but you will never have enough love to live in happiness, and will be stuck in the first half of my story.  However, remove your bigotry, and Love Piously, and no matter your conditions, you can and will achieve the happy ending the young man in the story finally received.
**** Piety and Bigotry.  Also, please read the quoted text, it's a separate story.
Sad to hear how much pain you've gone through, hope you'll be just fine soon enough! Also, my glenohumeral joints are positioned too far forward, which makes reaching high and carrying things quite painful for me, just wanted to say thanks for the link to the posture corrector-thingy, it looks like something that could help me fix this a lot easier than what I've been told so far. It's something I'll at least have to look into!
Thanks.
Some back-story frist. You have to know i was missing a considerable chunk from one of my vertebrae, which caused my head/neck/back kinda crooked (not to mention the agonizing pain). So, much like OP they custom-made this weird pulley-contraption so they could straighten my neck.  "I had to sleep on what was affectionately called "the iron board", because it looked exactly like that.
Oh but the fun didn't stop there. If I wanted to turn around (which I couldn't do mysef because my upper torso was immobile due to the halo-crown and the pulley-system) they placed another ironing board on my stomach. Then they squeezed it on me with this vice-like thing, and turned the whole thing around. (Hard to explain, but you'll get the idea). And voila, I was lying on my belly.
When sitting in my custom-made wheelchair (with a awesome pulley system) I could my head freely.  In fact, I made a sport of it to weight lift with my head. Which in retrospect wasn't the smartest idea, with the whole chunk missing from my vertebrae and all. Anyways, on the end of the ride I could weight lift 20 with my head alone and had this nice muscular neck. Which was an odd thing to see because the rest of my body was frail as fuck.
Sleeping was difficult. The board wasn't really wide or comfy. Pooping was... well lets say the bedpans saw a lot of use. Washing was easy.
Then, after surgery where they placed iron rods, much like OP the weights weren't needed anymore and they witch the suit to the "armor". My neck was then fully immobilized.
It was annoying as fuck because it was an extremely hot summer, and the armor was lined with this wool-like thing. And the damn thing couldn't come of. Washing was very problematic.
Sleeping was difficult too. By then the ironing board wasn't needed anymore and I could sleep in a regular bed.  I could turn around but it was very hard. I had to essentially pivot my whole body on this single screw (which was mind you embedded into my skull) to turn around, and I squeeze a cushion between my head, the mattress and the halo-crown, because my head would just hang there. very uncomfortable. 
The pooping thing got easier, but not by much. Still had to use bedpans, because I couldn't walk.
**** No; when on bed, yes; when sitting in wheelchair, no; after operation. Everything was difficult to some degree.
This is one of those magical, long comments of which I don't regret reading the whole story after the  Thank you, and the best of luck.
Many, many religious people really *would* meet the clinical definition of "delusion" if specialists would stop tiptoeing around the issue. In many cases, I would argue that it's blatantly pathological.  
There's more to delusion than believing things that happen to not be true– as I'm sure you know, it's more about *continuing* to believe in those things even after being presented with overwhelming evidence that they are not true.
 A six year old who believed in the Tooth Fairy shouldn't be classified as delusional. A *dentist* who believes in the Tooth Fairy should.
Now, although I know that this IS fake, it's not what bothers me about it.
It's the fact that the conversation is so blunt and simple, yet obviously comes across with a distinct fake feeling. Nobody talks like this. It's like watching a movie where you just feel how the sentences in a conversation are just like a beat on a drum. No improvisation or changes whatsoever.
Anywho, it bothers me just like when someone puts more than one exclamation point at the end of sentence. Actually, any exclamation points. It just feels fake and a desperate plea for attention
Conversations like this never happen, nor do people talk this way.
in February, I tried to cut off the internet completely. Well, that didn't work. But, I did stop teh facebooks. I still have an account, it is still active but I don't go on it unless someone messages me. What I did was put all notifications to e-mail, so if someone messages me, I can find out when I do my daily e-mail check. This way, you're not ignoring "friends" or relevant people, but you don't constantly need to go on. It has helped, next best thing to quitting, which I didn't want to do exactly because there are a few people who I kinda want to keep a connection with. But I haven't read the news feed for about two months, so I guess in the long run it doesn't matter. 
 do a soft quit of facebook, and make sure you can get notifications of messages/events through e-mail, so if someone messages you you can see it via e-mail instead of going on every day to check messages.
Just to add a few more points to the discussion beyond what everyone else has said (that you *can* enter a synagogue)
Mormons refer to their house of worship as a temple, which is of course very different from *the* temple in Judaism. When a Mormon temple is first built, it is traditionally opened to the public for a short period of time (I believe a few weeks), after which non-Mormons (and Mormons not deemed "worthy") are no longer allowed in the temple.  
So interestingly, while your post suggested you were asking about a Jewish Synagogue, I have to wonder if you inadvertently meant the Mormon temple. 
If you are not Mormon, you cannot enter a temple.  
Wow, that's actually kind of a dick move.  I've had that happen.  Cashier dropped (among other things) my apples.  On the floor.  Picked them up and rang them in.  I (politely) said I didn't want them any more.  I think her manager was watching, because she just said she'd be back, and ran off for a few seconds.  Came back with "new" apples for me, and I thanked her profusely for being so nice.  Turns out they weren't new apples, as most of them now had large mushy spots.  And I'm pretty sure she dropped them a couple extra times just because I was so rude as to not want crushed apples.  The part that really pissed me off, is that I wasn't the one who noticed, it was my son, who took one in his lunch to school.  So, his lunch was shorted by her ignorant behavior.  Bonus points: she charged me twice for the apples.
 People doing shit like this is what turns us friendly polite customers into raging bags full of dicks.
My favourite is as follows:
Customer: "oi mate, you got any of these out back"
Me: "I'll just check for you sir"
I go to have a look like a good little employee, and because I actually know what I'm doing, check all places I know the product may be before returning to the customer I'm serving. 
Me: "sorry sir, outof stock at the moment, it should be arriving on our delivery tomorrow, sorry about that"
Customer: " ain't no good tomorrow"
Cue him walking off in a huff. 
2 minutes after, I'm approached by another member of staff asking me about the product I've just been looking for. 
Apparently the customer asked 2 more people after I told him it was out of stock, and complained about my service to management.  I guess he didn't like the cut of my jib
customer complained about me because I didn't give him the answer he wanted. 
Anywhere between 80 and 90 is perfect, maybe 75... Play around with it and find your perfect grip, we're all different. Anything under it and your triceps are working more than you want them too. Nothing wrong with close grip bench press to work the triceps, but when working your chest you want your chest to do the majority of the effort. You see, a close grip it won't hurt you, it will hurt your gains, a wide grip on the other hand... Go as wide as you can without shoulder pain. 90 is a standard because nobody can go beyond that without having some trouble. I personally go 80 since I have shoulder problems.
 the closer the grip, the more the triceps work, the wider the more the chest works, anything over 90 is more likely to cause injury.
i read on a forum for my car that the speculation is that it is probably not heating/cooling and the humidity changes that are shorting the lifespan of the drives. 
As i understand it, when the car is started up, the electrical system will spike and that could be harming the drive. Your stereo system and other oem electrical equipment is either somehow isolated from this, or is built to somehow compensate or deal with this spike. 
They claim that these spikes can kill/damage the drives. Their solution was to remove the drive before starting the car, but otherwise leave it in the car.
: the power is spiking when you start your car, which is killing the drive. unplug the next drive every time you start up and see if that helps.
just to note, failure due to electrical spike may be immediately obvious, may not be noticeable, or may not even occur. Consider it a statistical possibility that electrical damage will occur. It's quite possible that you might not ever get damaged by the spike, if it occurs. Also, that thumb drive has multiple components, some of which may be more or less sensitive to electrical variations on a DC circuit. In a sense, the drive functions under that premise, so dumping extra power can burnout some of those more sensitive paths.
to that end, the advice on the forum was to buy multiple, smaller (and cheaper) drives keep your albums spread out on them (if you have to have them with you all the time) and keep your music backed up somewhere safe.
: I don't expect that results will be immediate, or that you will be able to remember to remove the device each time before starting car. only buy cheap, small drives and keep backups. treat it like they ALL will fail.
Well for the most part your carry should still be on bot farming like a boss and not roaming, so yes, for the most part keep following him almost the whole game unless someone else close by absolutely needs your help and you know your carry will be safe until you get back.
At this time though, your wards are a lot more important. Without them you're a lot less likely to know where anyone on the other team is, and that's one of the most important aspects of support, revealing where they are. Grab an Oracle's as well if you're on the more tanky supports like Alistar and Blitz, this way you can destroy any hidden items like enemy wards and teemo mushrooms, but know that when you go to destroy them the other team will know where you are. Make sure everything is safe (CV helps so much with this). If you're not a tanky support like Janna or Sona you're probably better off with clever pink ward placement. Soraka can go either way just fine because she can turn herself into a good tank to get away. 
If it's guaranteed safe, then get dragon (enemy mid still visible in his lane, both bot laners pushed out/dead/etc). To help make sure it's safe, place wards near it. Good places are the small bush next to mid but past the brush lying against the lane, purple teams blue brush, and the top of blue team's red bush. If you don't have enough wards to cover for this then you can use CV to monitor one spot for a little while.
When teamfights break out your job depends on what support you took, but it's pretty much always related to protecting the carry either way. 
- As Soraka you can silence someone that's trying to use abilities on an ally (or Riven mid jump so she can't jump anymore, stuff like that), this can be done to ruin their initiate, save allies lives, everything. As far as heal goes, when trying to decide who gets your spot heal, aim for the ally most likely to take more AD damage. This way he gets lots of life back + that 125 armor bonus REALLY makes a difference. 
- Same concept with Janna. Tornado to peel people off your allies and ruin their initiation, slow enemy stragglers that are trying to get away. Give the shield to someone who can use the AD bonus the most.
- Then there's the tankier supports like Malphite and Alistar. As either one you are probably the key initiator. Dashing in and pulverizing for an aoe pop up, which allows everyone else to get in, throw out their own CC and get tons of damage in before they even land.
- the entire game your main role is to assist the ad carry in getting as much gold as possible. Teamfighting depends on your skill kit and what items you've bought throughout the game.
Ent here.  Although I don't play that way anymore due to the fact that I play with my [kids](  
I can assure you we are as awesome over here as they are over there.  
Ent-related D&amp;D story time.
The year was 1987.  I was a student at the University of South Carolina.  I was running a game for my fraternity brothers.  It started out just three of us while the jocks laughed at us.  Soon they wanted to join and the group grew to nine adventurers and myself.  It was as good a way to flunk out of school as any other.
One of the players was a cleric of Ja.  He declared that his character had to toke up in order to have access to his spells, and whenever his character toked up, so did the player.  I had no problem whatsoever with this, but set the expectation that he would be limited to the same spells a cleric would normally have.  No problem.
So I'll skip all the nonsense about the temple they tried to rob and the heavy gas trap that forced them to escape into the sewage system from which they never actually found an exit, and their numerous quests for the basic necessities of life such as food and clean water rather than for treasure.  The part of the story we're concerned with here involves a raid on an underground castle held by goblins.  The target was something mundane like poultry.
The party threw their ropes and grappling hooks up the wall, climbed over the battlements, and silenced the guards.  They found what they wanted and were about to leave when they were discovered and the fight was on.  They fought bravely but the numbers were against them, so they put up a barricade and made a break for it.
Back at the wall, they rappelled down.  Except for the cleric of Ja.  At this point in the session many spells had been needed, and both the cleric and the player playing him were at [9] or [10].  The player declared that his character prayed to Ja for the power of flight.  He toked up one final time, imitated his character spreading his arms like wings, and said, "I fly off the wall!"
The grin on his face was priceless.
I rolled 5d6 fall damage and he died.
The goblins were now at the battlements with blowguns and poison darts.  The party, from a safe distance, looked at their fallen comrade and decided it was too dangerous to try to get him.  That is, until one player at about [5] announced he would go get him.  This character (a fighter, I think?  Wow, it's been 25 years already?) runs up to the fallen cleric, and checks first to make sure he's dead.  I roll a bunch of dice but he doesn't get hit. He somehow takes this to mean he's invincible.
"I moon them," he said.  And, unfortunately, for whatever reasons, he felt it necessary to LARP said action.
The dice don't lie, though, and the next round of darts felled him.  The other characters had seen enough and abandoned the fallen.
****  Don't moon the DM.
Not so sure. We have had a shit ton of moronic and insane legislation under Brewer and Pearce. While immigration is important, hispanics have a strong vote. I feel we will have a referendum on state politics. Between the constant attacks on immigrants and women's rights coupled with insane state politics... AZ will be a challenge for Mittster. Having said that, there is a strong Mormon voting block here - they're just not nearly as strong as the Hispanic+women vote.
Operation Fast and Furious is just more noise in the constant drone of violence on the border. I doubt it will have much effect at all among hispanics. That issue only works with white men.
 Women and Hispanics are pissed, don't count on this state being Red just yet.
Drug use *is* normal, and *is* something that some adults just do. You need to talk to your kid about your feelings about it at an appropriate choice, let them know your boundaries, and be able to expect them to be respected. The same goes for Bob, of course. You should talk to Bob and ask him not to use drugs (pot, or otherwise) in front of your kids. You should also think about the drugs that you use in front of your kids (coffee, over the counter medicines, and junk food do count) and have similar discussions with them about those habits that are proven to be harmful and your own feelings regarding their use. It sounds like you don't have very open lines of communication with the people involved.
Just ask him not to again and give your kids "the talk" at an appropriate age.
I grew up in FL, attended college &amp; now live/work in Atlanta. 
I have to say that I agree on principle with both laws. Here's why:
If Person X wants/applies/expects to receive an income or other compensation from an entity/organization/the government they have just created a relationship with that entity providing the funds. IMO, it is immediately not just a relationship, but a RECIPROCAL relationship because Person X is VOLUNTARILY applying for those benefits. Specifically, there is an inherent give &amp; take between the two parties to the relationship (for the discussion of the principle of the law, I am not considering how 'voluntary' the cause for said need is). 
To apply for welfare Person X will have to submit required documents and, in some situations, meet in person with a case worker. Person X does this voluntarily because there is a gain for them in the end -- the money to help assist them while unemployed. This is, at base, just another requirement that Person X will have to complete in order to get this benefit and a perfectly reasonable request to be made by the entity offering the funds. After all, it is a reasonable assumption that a new employer could give you a drug test in order for Person X to be hired, and thus receive compensation. 
That being said, I personally think a more effective manner of testing for those with real problems would be to have random testing as a condition of receiving benefits. You can hate on it if you want, that's my opinion.
Also, not technically related &amp; 100% anecdotal, but I've volunteered extensively throughout the city with youths &amp; what I noticed was a major, major apathy for getting an education/job because "I can just be on welfare like my parent(s)". Cyclical and generational welfare dependence is a SERIOUS problem and it's becoming more an attitudinal outlook than a fiscal reaction. 

the laws are not logically unsound on principle. And Atlanta may have a developing problem with apathetic welfare dependents. 
&gt;I am pretty sure at this point that you just don't like drug testing and thinks drugs should be legal, and will only take the 'anti drug test' side of a given argument, regardless of the details.
Not at all.  I think there are hard drugs that have significant dependency and criminal repercussions, and they should be dealt with aggressively.  There are some that I do not feel that way about.
&gt;  Where is this written?
I apologize, but the actual number, based upon the results from this New York Times article, is 2.6%.  According to the CDC - the national average is 8.7%.


&gt;I don't think it matters as much, considering that if you're spending welfare money on a bag of weed instead of spending it on supporting yourself then that money is still being wasted.
TANF is right now, about $183 a month.  If you can pay your rent, electricity, food, gas, insurance and all that, AND still buy weed, you are a master fucking accountant, and should be employed by the US government immediately.  Seriously.  I don't even have that kind of budgeting skill.
&gt;- MY tie is red today
I am wearing black.  According to Wesley Snipes, this is the appropriate color to bet on when playing Roulette and when trying to hijack planes.
**Edit:** I should note that transposons are not my specific field of study, but I have a working knowledge of them (I've read papers, attended lectures, and had conversations with people who do work on them).
That's a great question which is the subject of ongoing research.  As you've noted, transposons behave similarly to some viruses in many ways.  For those who are unfamiliar with transposons, they are transposable elements present in the DNA of many organisms (possibly all), which means they are sections of DNA that are removed by enzymes called "transposases" a locus in a chromosome and insert them somewhere else in the genome of the same cell.  This can be in the same chromosome or another chromosome.  How they choose their new insertion site is sequence-based for some transposons, and seemingly random for others (though probably at least partially dependent on local chromosomal architecture determined by histone location and post-translational modification and DNA methylation, termed "epigenetic mechanisms").  Some transposons encode for proteins, and some of those encode for their own transposases, and some don't.  These transposons have been an invaluable tool for researchers in a lot of fields in biology, including evolution and cancer research.  For instance, [this guy]( and his collaborators have developed a forward genetic screen in mice based on a transposon called "Sleeping Beauty" to discover new oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and cancer-modulatory genes.
Like many viruses, transposons can be divided into groups based on their replication mechanism: those that involve an RNA intermediate (retrotransposons and retroviruses) and those that don't (DNA transposons and DNA viruses).  Given that a transposon can encode its own transposase (essentially becoming self-replicating), and that they can be engineered to participate in horizontal gene transfer, it's not a far stretch of the imagination that viruses and transposons (and bacterial plasmids) may be evolutionarily linked.  The only thing they lack is the ability to leave the cell and infect another cell/organism ([horizontal gene transfer](  In fact, this is the leading understanding at this time.
The question then becomes: Did viruses arise from transposons-gone-awry or are transposons stripped-down viruses that became integrated into their hosts to such a degree, they gave up on trying to "infect" other cells.  The answer is most likely both.  Divergence in evolution is always a messy process, and we can find evidence of some transposons that were spread by [horizontal gene transfer]( (aka, they were "viruses"), but the fact that some transposases are encoded in the genome outside of transposons indicates that the virus either left the transposon somewhere else, or that the transposon evolved independently in that species.  It's hard to know which came first, the transposon or the virus, because transposons have been around for a long time and are under tremendous selective pressure.  Whatever species originally developed the first transposon/virus lived billions of years ago near the beginning of life on Earth, so we can't study it directly.  The best we can do is compare DNA sequences and genetic markers in extant transposons and viruses to try to figure out where they came from.
**** Some transposons and plasmids probably evolved into viruses, and some viruses probably inserted into hosts and turned back into transposons, but we can't rule out that some transposons have evolved independently in different species.
Thinking about it, when Rose left and the Doctor met Donna for the first time, he saw two people dancing and they reminded him of him and Rose. Most people can relate to seeing strangers and being reminded of a lost love. When he meets Martha, he meets a woman who is so much like Rose. A strong, beautiful woman capable of keeping up with him. She can do almost anything Rose could. She can keep up with the doctor, help in her own special, human way, and keep the Doctor in check. It hurts being reminded of lost love when you see strangers, but knowing someone who is so much like Rose is even worst. He tries to fool himself, when Martha tries to help, and the Doctor knows she can, he tries to pretend that Martha isn't as good as Rose because he doesn't want her to be. He says, "Rose would know what to do," because he knows Rose would and he doesn't want to believe that Martha is just as capable as Rose. I feel that if the roles were switched, he would be in love with Martha and when he met Rose, he would act like she isn't as good. When Martha leaves, she tells him that she can't waste her life on someone who won't be with her. This makes the Doctor realize that, because Rose is gone, he needs to get over her, or at least stop dwelling on her parting because he knows she can't come back. He'll stop comparing others to Rose. When he meets Donna a second time, he's done dwelling on Rose, and Donna notices that he's better. He thinks to himself "I have met you twice, in all of space and time (21st Century London) I have met you twice." Donna has proven herself a capable companion and the Doctor doesn't believe in coincidences. I feel that's why he was rude to Martha, but seemed to instantly get over everything and be happy with Donna.
*** The Doctor's actions towards Martha are understandable. *Not justified*, but understandable.
There's no intimacy at all here. Psychologically, this is not sex. They are not lovers, there is no relationship. He's doing a crazy thing at a party, and in all likelihood nobody will judge him for that.
I feel you've misrepresented me too, and I don't understand why you must discuss me at all. I don't study, these are *my views!* I drew my own conclusions. What the fuck man? I feel kind of angry, no textbooks were involved.
Earlier, didn't you say this will ruin his life? I mean, you're totally allowed to change your stance but I feel confused, I'll have to look back over the convo. I remember someone said he'd kill himself at 30, was that you?
Anyway, his parents oughta leave him with his aunt before they go rave at Kazantip, but we cannot really speak for his parents. We've only conjured them from imagination.
...
for my stance:
Kids should avoid Kazantip, but this boy will grow up ok. Reddit reacted blindly on ideology.
Hi, you don't understand cultural relativism at all. Cultural relativism isn't just the system that claims you can't judge people in a cultural value, because that is self-contradictory. Is that a universal value that you can't judge other cultures or just a cultural one? Both would contradict the statement.
That's because cultural relativism is a method of anthropology/science. Which is the method of reporting things should not be viewed as through a cultural lesson. While you want to claim some sort of moral relativism. But you don't even explain what is relative! 
Descriptively you can say two different people disagree. So? What epistemic value does that hold? That doesn't *prove* anything. If the ancient Greeks held that the Earth is the center of the universe, we don't start claiming that their value is culturally relevant. The mere disagreement is not evidence of different objective values.
Even then you make huge leap of logic, even if it was the case that nobody is objectively right or wrong (what is called meta-ethical relativism), you still have to prove your normative claim that I have to tolerate it. Just because morality is not-objective, on what grounds do I have to tolerate it? Just because the grounds for ethics is non-algorithmic doesn't mean that all values are equally valid. Another claim.
Supporting cultural relativism, does not justify child rape
Only on reddit can someone find justification of child molestation. 
First of all, it's ridiculous to claim that kids do not have any ability to consent at all. Children, past the infant stage, are certainly partially autonomous. Consent requires understanding, and a child definitely has a limited form of understanding. Which means that a kid can consent or deny consent meaningfully to small range of subjects. This could include playing in the back yard, eating a particular food, watching a particular show, and other decisions kids make. In other words, they can consent to small range of activities. 
However, when any individual does not understand the situation, then no meaningful consent can be given. Furthermore, a anyone who is forced to be put in a situation which he or she does not understand is having their autonomy infringed upon. This could be justified in most medical situation, but it is never appropriate in the case of sexual acts. 
Child molestation is always wrong because the kid doesn't what he or she is doing, even if there were no health or psychological impact on the life of the child.
Dude, I don't post in SRS.  I do however agree with them that you shouldn't let bad things said go without mentioning it's fucked up.  Freedom of expression and what not.  However, I have only ever seen people try and turn them into the bad guys, and frankly I've never ever seen any real evidence that they actually are.  However, if someone was harassing you and sending you PMs, then fuck them, no matter which team they play on.  
You and I agree that the video is fucked up.  Focus on that.  Because if you don't and instead use your soap box to take on what is your own agenda against a group of people on the internet that neither of us really knows, then yes as Peritract says, it kind of looks like you're defending the fucked up stuff instead.
 You're pointing your gun in the wrong direction today.  
This reminds me of a situation I encountered recently. My buddy and I were enjoying our high and decided to go to 7-11. I was at around a [7] and he was at a [5] when we saw two police cruisers outside the store. We thought, "No big deal" and went in. When we go in there are four cops in the store and we were the only civilians besides the cashier. As we browse, two more cops come in. And as we get on line, four more cops come in. So now it's ten cops and two stoned people in the store. My friend thought it was hilarious and I was struggling to keep a decent poker face on. 
- 10 cops and two stoned people in a very small store
If youre talking about timing, you dot really get that from tabs, however people will space things out to represent timing. Sometimes for more difficult songs they will actually map out the beats above the tab. 
 listen to the song and work it out by ear. Use the tabs as a guide.
One of my friends woke up in his home after a hard night of partying, it was later in the morning so classes had been going for a good couple hours. The first thing he things of is that his car is probably being towed, because it's not parked very legally... he's also missing his wallet. On his way to where his car's parked (like across campus) he starts randomly finding pieces of his clothing on the ground. Following the trail, he finds jeans, shirt, jacket, and his wallet - on the ground, completely untouched! The last piece of clothing was in a random administration building on campus, where the trail led him to. He said he must've passed out in there, then woke up still drunk and on his way home and to bed, just started taking his clothes off haha. What a guy and what a night... his car wasn't towed btw :)

Something else people seem to constantly overlook is good ol' soap and disinfectant. It's no good to survive the zombie onslaught only to die because of poor hygiene. Think about, zombies are decomposing corpses- the filthiest possible thing to be around. I know the general consensus is that bacteria don't inhabit zombies, but there's still a lot of health risks around and you want to be in good health to fight zombies, y'all!
** Disinfectant is as important as any weapon in your zombie survival kit!**
Egypt is crucial for the middle east, pretty much the command centre, if It's strong the middle east is basically forced to obey, since egypt's foreign diplomacy is far more superior than any other country in the middle east, and in no doubt the Egyptian military is superior comparing to other countries in the middle east, not as superior as Israel of course, but more superior than the others in the region. 
When Egypt gets back on its feet, the middle east will be less of a hot zone.
About the point of breaking free of mubarak's rule, maybe I agree with u about not breaking his rule, but the people of Egypt most definitely changed, if u asked anyone about anything in politics, the simplest of questions, he wouldn't know the answer, now everyone started to learn some bits of politics, and basically everyone at least knows the basics, so on that subject am not worried, there is no way another dictatorship to happen cause people simply evolved and developed, too late, but better than nothing.
Just to explain for everyone the reason behind this protest, am gonna recap some points,
1) last year there was a yes or no vote about wether the Egyptian people make the constitution before or after the presidential elections.
2) the muslim brotherhood and salafists wanted to make the constitution first so they tricked the lower class , that if they voted no they go to hell, if they vote yes they go to heaven, and since Egypt was blessed with many ignorants, illiterates, they voted yes for constitution first, now all they have to do is to make those very same people to vote for them in the parliament.
3) guess who again, the same suspects, the Muslim brotherhood and salafists won the majority of the parliament seats, they decided eventually that the 100 persons that will be making the constitution will be 50%from the parliament ( that they own) and 50% from outside the parliament which of course no one agreed about it, and it failed, but not after it drained precious time.
4) now since the constituation committee failed by a court order, they have to start all over again, they need to pick another 100 people with ratios which everyone must agree about, and actually make a constitution in ....... 2 months instead of what should have been 6 months, but cause of the brotherhood and salafists, the Egyptians lost 4 months
5) now the military got the cards, the people voted yes for constitution first, and at the moment there is not constitution, not even the committee, not even the standards of who to pick, by law he is correct, the people wanted constitution first they will grant it, it's like a forced penetration exactly, u gonna take it wether u like it or not.
The military wants to postpone the elections cause the Egyptians wanted a constitution before the president, and they didn't make the homework on time.
The main problem at the moment in Egypt and the very cause and source and creator/Developper is the Muslim brotherhood and the salafists, this whole mess and the legal opportunity the military has now was Made and given by them.
People love imposing religion, but they themselves don't live by it. :(
Cheers and god bless The youth of Egypt.

I Pre-ordered the Collectors edition, as well as the collectors edition game guide as soon as I could. When I found out when it was to be released I was sad because I won't have any internet for three months. Today I decided to get the open Beta to try it out a little bit and found out that my computer is too old and can't support it. So...
TLDR Diablo 3 collectors edition will be sitting in my room for three months until I make enough money to buy a new computer and return back to my university.
Just got off finishing the beta, took me a couple of hours to get on. Finished it in around 2 and a half hours whilst taking everything in. Once I'd completed it I got off because I knew someone else could take my spot (and I recommend you do too if you have a free weekend!)
Also, I suggest the following: Turn physics on in the video options, make the screen the same as your resolution (sounds dumb but mine didn't do it automatically) and turn profanity filter off (the game is for years 15 and up so I don't really think it's too necessary).
Here's what I thought:
The flow of the game is unbelievable. The animations are smooth, the physics are a nice touch and the music is beautiful (&lt;3 Tristram theme). They've kept the point and click elements nice and simple but added a few skills which fit in nicely. I wasn't a fan that elements of WoW had slipped in (like being feared, some skills, etc) but it lets you play the game with your own personal style. It also adds more emphasis to cooperative play, making your roles important to one another.
I didn't get much of a chance to build up many skills but it's not the same as it used to be - I can't really judge it too well yet. It is completely different though (no talent trees).
Loot drops for your own character so you don't have to hold down the Alt key all the time to avoid ninjas. Shrines are also shared (hurrah!) meaning that buffs are distributed to people nearby. 
Don't play the game if you want the same experience as Diablo 2. The original authentic gothic-ness of D2 doesn't really exist any more, it's very much been 'Blizzarded'. That said, some of the particle effects and environments blew me away. I would often go illogical routes to see what the environment looked like. Destructible terrain and environmental kills add a surprising amount to the game play.
The new crafting system is pretty awesome. You can 'disenchant' rare items for crafting materials. You also level up as you go along, which means you can make some pretty nice items. You get some benefits from crafting and following the story line. The achievements and massacres are a fun touch to the game too. If you string a series of kills together you get bonus experience.
Part of me misses using pots, scrolls and runes (the kind you can pick up). Deckard Cain didn't say "stay a while and listen" and I'm still waiting to find wirt's leg somewhere hidden in the game. Also, if you find something unidentified just right click it (took me a while to find that out, derp).
**Diablo 3 is really fun to play. Stress free to people who usually play competitive games. More co-op. More color. Some interesting new features. Beta takes around 2 to 3 hours to complete. Expect many Blizzard elements.**
**Let me know what you guys thought!**
In a FFA style Season (like 5 will be) Swig view has no real use. It is also likely that there will be players who people aren't subbed to and so having all the individual videos posted in the subreddit makes perfect sense.
Either way, those people who seem enraged and offended by the individual videos being posted seem unable to look at a post and think "That doesn't interest me so I'll just ignore it".
Why they are calling for rules to be implemented to prevent such posts baffles me. If it really bothers them that much they can use the downvote to have their say, just like everyone else.
**If you don't like a post, ignore or downvote it and quit whining.**
EDIT: Fixed their/there

What is "overweight"? Clinically overweight (BMI over 25, 30 lbs over recommended) or obese?
What is your build? Are you overweight?
Is she really "fat" or have you been watching too much porn? Are you being hypocritical?
I'm sure you don't think I was subscribed to a data subreddit to view one post and move on. Seems to be counter-intuitive, no? 
Since I've been subscribed here, I've seen more abominations and sheer bastardisations of data than I ever have dealing with the usual workplace ethos of ignorance. 
Data is beautiful if you can parse and understand at a glance, given context if necessary. The type of auto-erotic visualisations displayed here are of no use, other than to stroke the frustrated artistic streak in whoever wasted their time creating them.

1st my wife teaches human development and has a PhD.  We had our child and as always he would not let us sleep.  I managed to convince her that after delivery women have a hormone that helps them function without sleep better.  When the kid would wake up I would remind her of the hormone and she felt bad about waking me up.  I started feeling guilty when she asked me for a source so she could put it in her lecture.
 Trolled my wife, the scientist, with fake research.
My woman is deathly afraid of spiders. One halloween season i found a very nice tarantula "for the kids". It was hard plastic with hair or fur on the legs and about the size of a womans fist. I hid it next to the footboard under the bed just peeking out a little. I did this on a saturday night expecting her to find it within minutes. However, we had a busy weekend and it went unnoticed until she was getting ready for work Monday morning. Her screams woke the kids. I got a very angry /teary call while on my way to work...why would you do something like that?
scared the shit out of her with nice fake spider
If you want a cheap ashtray, do you really care what you are using?  I don't mean that in a negative sense, I tend to smoke in the backyard and don't routinely use an ashtray.  Though, I was gifted a very nice one that I appreciate and sits next to my humidor.  So, in that sense, any sort of empty-able cup/can/dish serves the purpose.  So, if you aren't going to buy something (or don't want to spend much), it seems like any semi-enjoyable canister can get the job done.  Consider: favorite coffee can, favorite tobacco can, etc etc etc...
I also have a [portable guy]( (also a gift), which I appreciate, but not really as an actual ashtray.  Though the few times I have used it, I received a lot of great feedback.
Overall, I think the only "features" I've noticed to have an impact are when I'm smoking with a friend and we both desire a resting spot for a lit cigar.  If you are going to have a few friends over, a nice cigar ashtray will have multiple holders.  My "nice" one has two, and that has always sufficed, even with more than two smokers.  It juts doesn't seem like people want to set down their smokes at the same time.
(sorry for the wall of text) - two slots for holders seems to be enough, nothing else really matters but aesthetics.  
[My favourite reply](
&gt;I tried this as well. Ended up making a fool of myself though. Argument wasn about Christianity but about the drafters of the constitution believing in a personal god. I argued that the bulk were deists. Turns out that of 55 people, 49 were Protestants, 3 were deists and 3 were anti church but still believers. Even r/atheism is capable of selective quotation to support its cause (gasp!)
Gosh darn it, that argument grates me so. The 'not a Christian nation' one does, too, but not as much. I don't think the Founding Fathers imagined the U.S. not being Christian. If it's true, how much does that matter? Governments evolve, and we've reestablished our nation as the land of the free, including free religion. Yes, we have to keep fighting for our freedom, but as a history nerd who likes honesty, I think revising our history to help these fights leads us down a bad path. People latching on to "The Founding Fathers were deist!" are creating disinformation to support secularism, rather than forming better arguments with true supporting evidence.
***; The statement "the Founding Fathers were deists and the U.S. wasn't found as a Christian nation," make me rage because it doesn't seem supported by history.
If it wasn't for all the addicts or wannabe addicts on reddit, this would not be on the front page. 
This article while seemingly beating up government offers no new information and what it does offer, while being spun heavily is still worthless...
Examples:
* It's stated insidiously that the alcohol industry has give 10k to anti drug efforts, like that's a bad thing?! 
* That the prison system reported that if anything should change, listing a dozen or so items, including possible references to drug arrests, their profits would be affected... no shit
* That recovery industry which wants insurance companies to pay for illnesses has spent over 5 million in 23 years lobbying for that and a myriad of other items... really? Pretty sure Obama got that every 15 minutes while on the trail.
* That drug testing companies have spent 10k a year lobbying for something!?! 
* That Florida could of saved 45k if it just paid the welfare recipients that are addicted to drugs while not mentioning the power of deterrence... you know, the hundreds, possibly thousands that stopped taking drugs to avoid positives on such tests??? 
FOR TL;DR
When a blog post or editorial like this pops up, pot heads quickly surface it to the top despite lacking any merit.
When the facts are laid out, there is absolutely no pro argument that can't be quickly dismissed by analyzing the facts
That's funny, I've had an exact opposite experience.  I accidentally placed an order on their site while I was looking around, and checking shipping prices.  They e-mailed me a week later asking for payment.  So, I calmly explained that it was an accident.  They responded by saying that it wasn't an issue AND they would send me something anyway  2 weeks go by, and here arrive a mixed bag of 10 seeds for free.
accidentally placed order, cancelled and got free seeds anyway
As a main jungler who plays Shaco and all the standard junglers, I feel like you make a valid point. Shaco does have a role late game; whether it be split pushing, soloing baron, or attempting to assasinate the enemy AD / AP Carry. However, compared to the other tanky DPS junglers, his team fight presence is lacking incredibly late game. If you build pure damage on Shaco, he will be melted extremely quickly by the AD carry who is hitting 1k every AA. If you build tanky, he doesn't have any natural tankiness. When the enemy support, who usually does, buys oracles, his assassination attempts are foiled easily. That being said, Shaco does have a late game role; however, in a 5 v 5 team fight other junglers are much better suited to do the roles of initator, peeler, or divers.
 Shaco is not as good as other melee jungles in late game team fights but has other roles that can win the game easily. 
One of the major points of his character is that he *doesn't* have a "legitimate" claim to the throne, as far as traditional rules of succession are concerned. He's meant to stand as the "arch-realist" of the claimants, declaring himself king by force of arms without the pretense of any formal authority to do so. Stannis is the "strict formalist" who believes that he must be king, even though he doesn't "want it" nearly as much as the others (and nobody else seems to want him to have it, either), because the law is the law, and it's his duty to fulfill that. Joffrey is similar to Stannis in that he believes all the other claimants are denying his lawful right to the throne, but his advisers (especially Tyrion and Tywin) are more realist than formalist. Robb isn't, strictly speaking, a "claimant," but he could be described as the "idealist," fighting for the independence of his homeland in violation of "the law," but based on something more than Renly's somewhat-cynical "I can do it, and I want it, so I will." Balon Greyjoy falls in the same category as Robb, on this chart. Dany is actually somewhat like Stannis, in that she keeps pushing to reclaim "what is hers," *because* it is hers. She's certainly not a realist, at least not in the same way as Renly, and she's operating within the structure of her "rights" and "the law," which separates her from Robb and Balon. 
 Renly doesn't have a legit claim, and that's part of the point of his character (insofar as it shows how he differs from the other claimants, especially Stannis).   
I believe this is actually made from pewter or some other metal with a low melting point.  He would have poured the molten metal into the mouth of the ant colony and then dug it up once the metal had cooled inside.  
You could use plaster, but the molten metal would travel through the openings easier since it would burn anything in it's path.

I want you to consider for a moment that a significant cross section of your sneaker's responsibilities should involve scouting and recon.
If you're not locked into some sort of restraint, you really lose out on a fun part of the game that involves researching a foe.  This is why ambushes hold their punch - both for you and against your enemies.
 Give your rogue something to do.  This makes it interesting for everyone, they get to be useful, and you get to stride into a big fight with a carefully curated list of spells designed to drive the villain *absolutely nuts*.
These seem to be the big takeaways from the article.
&gt; Is it now the state's responsibility to let men know their wives have been unfaithful? 
The state goes after men in all kinds of situations. Why is it asking too much for this one thing?
&gt; Even when they have suspicions that Mom isn't being absolutely honest, many men won't insist on a paternity test for one simple reason: because they want to be Dads.
The key word here is ‘insist’. I doubt many men insist because of the whole trust thing you brought up.
&gt;The bill takes the position that if your DNA is part of this child's genetic composition, you are a father, and thus financially responsible for that child.
This is already the case. 
&gt;She gets to have her character called into question because she either didn't know or didn't say who her baby-daddy was.

After the Sin War and the sacrifice of Uldyssian, when the Agiris Council was in deliberation on the fate of Sanctuary, Hell was already planning it's move.  Whether it was intended for this apart of some grand scheme, it will never be truely known, but the Demon Lord Mephisto, Lord of Hatred, approached the Agiris Council with an offer after the Heavens decreed Sanctuary spared.  
Mephisto would get Inarius to take back to the Burning Hells, and the Forces of Hell would not interfere with Sanctuary, creating a "Cold War" between the two factions over the new world.  The Agiris Council agreed, letting Mephisto take Inarius back to the Burning Hells, and letting mankind determine their place in the Eternal Conflict.
This did not please the 4 Lesser Demon Lords of Hell, Andarial, Maiden of Anguish, Duriel, Lord of Pain, Azmodan, Lord of Sin, and Belieal, Lord of Lies.  Togeather, they rallied their forces and banished the Three Prime Evils to Sanctuary.
Upon realizing Terror, Hatred, and Destruction were on Sanctuary, Tyreal worked with mankind and created the Horadrim, an order of magi dedicated to the capture of the Prime Evils.  To do this, Tyreal gave the Horadrim  3 powerful Soulstones, capable of containing the Prime Evils within them.
Mephisto was caught in the Jungles of Kurast, and his stone was kept under guard by the Zakarum.
Diablo was caught near Tristram, and his stone was kept in the labyrinth benieth the Horadric Monestary.
Baal, the Lord of Destruction, managed to shatter the stone intended for him before it was able to contain him.  Tal'Rasha, a powerful mage, offered his body to complete the prison.  Deep in the desert, Tal'Rasha's comrades built an impressive Runic Prison, and shoved the Stone fragment into Tal'Rasha, completing the prison for the Lord of Destruction.  Tal'Rasha would wrestle with the demon for hundreds of years..... only to lose his sanity and humanity.

*****: The Prime Evils cut a deal with Heaven, the lesser lords don't like it and banish the Three to Sanctuary. Tyreal gives man the ability to capture them and imprison them.  SHIT GETS EASIER.
Now, hundreds of years later, the Prime Evils were setting out to carry out their plan.  Mephisto had managed to corrupt his soulstone, and was able to influence the Zakarum priesthood around him.  In that end, Mephisto had the Zakarum High Council shatter his soulstone prison into seven shards, breaking the prison and freeing Mephisto.  The largest shard was driven into the hand of the High Priest Que-Hegan Sankekur, of which Mephisto used his body as his vessel in Sanctuary.  The other 6 shards were driven into the hands of the other high priests, who where charged with brining the Lord of Hatred sacrifices to nourish himself.
**Diablo I Begins here**

Diablo as well had managed to corrupt his soulstone prison.  Archbishop Lazarus was in commune with the Lord of Terror after Diablo was able to overcome his prison.  Lazarus, who had the ear of King Leoric, brought the King to Tristram in hope of possessing the King.  When that failed and drove the King mad, Lazarus was instructed to kidnap Price Albrecht, the Kings son.  Lazarus brought the boy deep into the labyrinth, and shoved the soulstone into the young boys head, giving Diablo a material vessel in Sanctuary.  However, the young boys body did not allow Diablo to manifest his full power.   Diablo bides his time, and turns the lower levels of the labyrinth into an outpost of Hell.
The Kings older son, Aiden, succeeds in defeating the Lord of Terror, and realizes that to contain the demon, he must attempt to do it himself.  He removes the soulstone from his younger brothers head, and shoves it into his.  Sadly, the Lord of Terror overcomes Aiden, and Aiden becomes the Dark Wanderer, heading East to the deserts and Lut Gholein. 
 
**Diablo II and the Lord of Destruction**
In his wake, he leaves Andarial and Duriel to guard his path to stop any would be heroes from stopping him freeing his brother Baal, Lord of Destruction, and Mephisto, Lord of Hatred.  Along his way, he picks up Marius, and unseeming man, who is actually key to a contigency plan.  In the Tomb of Tal'Rasha, Baal decieves Marius and has Marius pull out the Soulstone that binds him to his Runestone prison.  Tyreal, who is fighting Diablo, manages to instruct Marius to go to the Temple of Light in the City of Kurast, to go into the portal to Hell and smash the stone on the HellForge, which would banish the demon to the Black Abyss.
Marius finds the portal, but lacks the will to step through the portal.  The heroes travel to Hell and defeat Diablo, and Mephisto at the Temple of Light.  Their Soulstones were smashed at HellForge.... Except Baal's.
Baal finds Marius in an asylum.  Posing as Tyreal, he retrieves his stone, and kills Marius and burns the Asylum.  Baal summons a large demonic army, and proceeds to march on Mount Arreat, the sacred homeland of the Barbarians and the location of the Worldstone.  
Baal succeeds in corrupting the Worldstone, but is defeated in the Worldstone Chamber.  Tyreal instructs to heroes to retreat, as he is forced to destroy the Worldstone.  Doing so shatters Mount Arreat, as well as the barrier from Hell and Heaven Sanctuary had, and the damper on the powers of mankind that have been kept dormant for centuries......

If anyone wants more context on any of the close-as-I-could-jot-down quotes, I'll be happy to provide it. One of the worst parts of having to listen to this guy was the fact that he would sweep directly from actual medically supportable information straight to utter nonsense. Gives the good back-crackers a bad name.

Woah now, I wasn't saying that. I could not care less what others think about me smoking weed. I was depressed because I only had one or two friends for a while and I thought I was weird and an awkward and forever alone kinda guy. But since I've started smoking weed, and discovering the meaning of introversion, I've started to become more comfortable with myself and realizing that I'm happy with who I am. And when I became more comfortable with myself, I started becoming more confident and comfortable around other people. Plus, smoking does bring people together, and smoking with other people has helped me meet some good friends, because we all like to just get high and hang out. And I'm pretty high now, and I don't really remember where I was going with this story.
I guess the is that I didn't mean that to sound like the way you thought I meant that to sound, and weed has definitely helped me with my depression.
Funny, I took a European History class this semester. First thing the professor said was basically, "Think as historians in this class. Don't let your personal thoughts color what you learn here."
Of course, I understand this, and I have no problem analyzing things as they are without looking at them through the lens of my personal opinion.
Next class? He began slowly building up to a rant about how much he hated people saying "Happy holidays" as opposed to "Merry Christmas" and how America was a nation founded on Christianity. He just kept going on and on and on. Eventually I just couldn't sit there and listen to him spout this crap anymore, so I got up, left, and dropped the class. I only got half of a refund because I didn't drop the class before the second day. I also didn't get a refund on the book I rented for it.
 I paid roundabout $200 to listen to a history professor stand in front of me and tell me that "happy holidays" was un-American, and that America was founded on Christanity in a European history class.
There are a few things I personally take issue with, and it's more intent based than it is facially wrong. First "Our Father." Calling G-d our father is something we do in Judaism. But in Christianity, Father is a term of art. If you are referencing G-d as the father in reference to his relationship as the teacher of your faith, then that's fine. If you are using Father to ascribe to him partness, namely, the father in the trinity, than saying Father is heresy as it is a fundamental belief that G-d is one without parts. Another issue I see is, "who art in heaven." Again, saying G-d is in heaven is something Jews say too. But it is not literal. It's more of an expression that G-d's will is expressed in heaven. G-d is an infinite being and heaven is a created plane of existence. G-d can not be contained or have a spacial relationship with heaven as that would be a limitation on his essence, a logical absurdity. This can't be parsed in Christianity because Christians believe that angels have free will and heaven can be a chaotic place. When a Christian says G-d is in heaven, it's blasphemy. When the Jews say it, because heaven and the angels do not have the capacity to disobey G-d's will, we mean to say that the presence of G-d's will is perfectly expressed in heaven. The rest checks out except perhaps lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. I don't know the original Greek, so I don't know what they mean by "but" and "evil." If you are asking G-d not to test you (temptation) but to force your free will to avoid evil (deliver us from evil), then it is a blasphemous as it is a prayer in vain. For one, G-d will not nullify your freewill. Also, you should pray for more tests so you can maximize your reward and exercise your gift of freewill. If the word for evil perhaps means something more like calamity, and the but is better translated as "and," it can be apologized for. If you are merely praying for the strength to not be lead by temptation, and separately, you are praying that no bad things happen to you, then it is acceptable.
TL:DR; It takes a lot of apologizing and reinterpretation to not make it blasphemous. And the things that need to be changed challenge the fundamentals of Christian thought. For this prayer to not be blasphemous, you would have to reject the trinity and rebelling angels.
It doesn't have anything obviously in contradiction to Jewish teaching (though the "lead us not into temptation" bit doesn't fit with Jewish theology very well, but it's not clearly against it either).  However, it's from Christian scriptures, which makes it historically different.
A more subjective reason is that it doesn't sound Jewish.  I know it's weird, but Christian prayers just don't feel quite right, even if there are no doctrinal issues.
Jesus wasn't violating any Jewish laws by saying it (though he was by suggesting it replace existing prayers), but it's not quite so clear today.

I remember reading the second book in the trillogy in 7th grade. the idea was to have the first be part of 6th grade curriculum, the second part of 7th and the third part of 8th. that never happened correctly and we only ever read the second book. I think it was called Shakespeare Stealer? or maybe that was only the second book. I remember it referenced the girl from the first book, the one pretending to be a boy, but she wasn't a main character so I don't know if it's actually the same series or not...
"Shakespeare Stealer" see if that's it.
Here you go :
I was extremely, thoroughly disapointed with the Hooters in Akasaka. I had fond memories of my first visit to a Hooters as an exchange high-school student in the US, so my hopes might have been slightly distorted.
- the food is *awful* (like, reaaaaalllly bad, your average KFC is better)
- the music is way, way too loud, impossible to have a decent conversation
- the girls are average. 

I invited my bucho a few days after it opened for a nomikai. We left after one beer to go to a standard Izakaya in Akasaka Mitsuke, and he spent the night making fun of me and my choices of places to have drinks.
: do not go to Hooters in Tokyo.

Disclaimer: my response assumes you live in the US and is based on time I spent taking inbound calls for a major healthcare provider.  Please independently verify the below as I can't guarantee the info is correct - the job was a few years back.
You are in a pool among other individuals based on if you have a personal policy or one through your employer - if you have a personal you're grouped with other people with similar demographics; employer your pool is your co-workers or, if you're a small company, with other companies of similar size.
Your monthly premium is a calculation based on a LOT of factors, some of them being the # of people in the pool, the # of claims received, the types of visits (specialty of provider, severity of diagnosis, preventive), and the frequency of visits.
All of this is calculated and averaged and a "reasonable # of annual visits" type thing is created - this is the figure that your premium is calculated based on.  When this # goes up, based on the stats from your pool, so does your premium.
So, long story short: the ethical implication of insurance fraud for consumers is that those committing the fraud are essentially screwing over themselves and everyone else in their pool.  The effect can be increases in premiums, strict diagnosing requirements for procedures to be approved/paid, reduction in covered services, more stringent requirements for personal policies to be issued, etc.
**- insurance fraud results in higher premiums and more strict requirements for approval/payment of services**
They support Nordic culture, which makes sense in Skyrim. They don't seem to take issue with non-Nords who integrate as much as people make them out too.
Ulfric hates the Dunmer who have moved into his city. The Dunmer who refuse to integrate, come from a truly racist culture, and worship what are effectively demons to the Nords: Remember what Boethiah stands for. Would you want a bunch of racist individuals with a history of hating your people to suddenly move in to your town while actively practicing a religion that would endorse killing you all in your sleep? No, you wouldn't. If the Dunmer wish to be accepted they need to integrate to some extent.

The Khajiit? The caravans actually are all composed of criminals; talk to them for a minute or two in the game. They're all criminals and they all dislike Skyrim. Why in the world would Ulfric use what few resources he has to defend them? Non-Caravan Khajiit seem to be okay entering cities; I don't see any PCs unable to complete the main quest.
And the Argonians actually do have a psycic connection to the Hist. Note that so many of them got up out of the blue and returned to Black Marsh for the Oblivion Crisis. They're a Fifth Column based on their very nature.
The actions normally cited as horribly racist by Ulfric are nowhere near as bad as people say. He never actually DOES anything to support the statement that he's horribly racist. Are some Stormcloaks racist? Sure. But the Imperials constantly berate the Nords; even those who they work with.

As for the seemingly imminent Thalmor victory: The Thalmor could have invaded Hammerfall at any point during the Civil War and the Empire would have done nothing. Why didn't they? Because invading that single province would be an issue. The Empire is weaker than the sum of its parts. The Empire right now commands the might of both Cyrodil and High Rock, but can't deal with Skyrim, despite the fact that a good portion of Skyrim still supports the Empire?
The Empire is weak. The Kingdoms that would form in its wake following a collapse may well be stronger.

 A Stormcloak victory doesn't mean the Thalmor win, and the Dunmer, Khajiit and Argonians really DO deserve to be distrusted. The phrase "race" is misleading in this game; they're different species and not inherently the same.
I'm just going to answer your lack of research with an old quote from an old thread:
&gt;The way I see it, a Stormcloak victory would be best for the Dominion in the long term (and the Thalmor are all about long term plans), if only for the fact that it would be a more devastating blow to the Empire then anything the Thalmor were able to do. That would leave the Empire with only the provinces of (Besides Cyrodiil) High Rock, and Morrowind.
&gt;With Skyrim lost, High Rock would suddenly be completely cut off from the rest of the Empire, with the only routes to Cyrodiil blocked by very anti-Imperial independents. This would force High Rock to take desperate measures in order to maintain vital trade lines, and likely its very survival, leading to a possible secession to placate its grumpy neighbors. The Bretons have also always been very factious, if the aforementioned cause of a secession doesn't happen, then being completely cut off from the Imperial peacekeepers coming from Cyrodiil would be the perfect opportunity for old grudges between the various factions to reignite and likely lead to violence. This in-fighting among the Bretons would most certainly lead to High Rock either seceding or eventually becoming so devoured by sectarian violence as to be utterly useless to the Empire as a whole.
&gt;Then there's Morrowind. Already the province is in dire straits. Though the Red Year was long ago, the province as a whole seems to be slow on the recovery. Though despite their crippled land, the Dunmer have always been proud but pragmatic, and considering how utterly brutalized and weakened the Empire would be by this point they may decide it to be in their best interest to strike out on their own and secede. Then there's the fact that the Nords are now run by unashamed human-supremacists. The Nords have always eyed Morrowind with hunger or hatred throughout history, and an invasion would not be unexpected. Any way things go for Morrowind, it would either secede, be dead weight for the Empire, or be pummeled yet again by invaders.
&gt;When all is said and done, this would lead to the doom of the Tamrielic Empire.
&gt; If the Stormcloaks win, it would likely trigger a cascade effect eventually leading to the total collapse of the Empire. The Dominion wouldn't even have to reignite the Great War, just sit back and watch the empire of men crumble before gobbling up the broken pieces of Tamriel one by one.
The rebels, who couldn't even win without the help of a Dovahkiin anyway, are no match for the master mages of the Thalmor, too.
You're fucking striking. Your face is slightly more elongated and thinner than most peoples', but with your body type, pretty facial features, and hairstyle, it works very well. I think you're gorgeous, and I have to imagine most other guys would, too.        
       
I think your hair looks awesome when it's down (if you have that style still), and the color was great, too. I think you'd look older if you cut it, but that's not a suggestion, just an observation. I like the look very much.                
         
You appear to have the ability to dress up and dress down, which is excellent (nobody wants a girl who wears fancy outfits all the time; We love a woman who can throw on jeans and a t-shirt and be comfortable).       
      
All in all, you are pretty much the exact opposite of ugly. If you want more confidence boosting, you could try r/amisexy, but be warned there will always be trolls, no matter how attractive the poster is. Also, people will probably say some creepy things haha.          
         
On a one to ten scale, you're a solid 8.5. So if you're not getting approached by guys, chances are good that it's because you're intimidating them. If you're an admitted shut in, and hanging out at Cons, chances are pretty good that the nerds (I use the term affectionately, I'm a pretty big nerd myself) are just plain too afraid to try hitting on you.      
     
Also, if you're going to bars and not getting hit on, that's generally a good thing. I'm sure free drinks are nice (being an average looking dude, I wouldn't know, nobody has bought me one), but as a dude, a lot of the dudes in bars creep ME out.       
        
 You're very, very attractive. 
It's a little late for easter but I had an easter party and did an easter egg hunt and hid a bunch of little bottles of booze and eggs filled with weed. It was really fun, plus I cooked 4 pounds of bacon. I think that helped.

The problem is that the majority of people crying out against CISPA haven't even read the bloody thing and are just parroting what is told to them. They hear things like "no more privacy" and shout that CISPA means that the 4th Amendment no longer works, even though they have been signing away their privacy to all these companies all this time. Google knows the contents of all your emails, knows who your friends are, your favourite porn star and all your hobbies. Facebook knows where you went, who you broke up with, and how many duckface pictures you made. And people want to complain about CISPA? 
The people here keep comparing SOPA with CISPA, even though these are completely different bills, where quite honestly the only similarity is that it pertains to the internet. CISPA has been written with input and support from Google, Facebook, Yahoo etc. People keep asking "WHY?" and point at these companies for their hypocrisy. They have absolutely no idea how politics work, because this is called COMPROMISE. CISPA is something that these companies can control, because it is what they have been doing all this while. CISPA puts power into the companies hands, because they can choose the kind of information that gets sent to the government in the event of "cyber-terrorism". The very fact that "cyber-terrorism" is defined in an ambiguous manner means that there can be opportunity for delay tactics if the need arises. 
So many people have no ability to see the bigger picture, or think for themselves, or learn to understand how things work. CISPA is bad, but only bad in the sense that all government legislation is "bad". CISPA is a step in the right direction after what happened with SOPA. The bill is unlikely to pass eventually, but it sends a message to the lawmakers that the tech companies are willing to cooperate, calming fears of a repeat of the SOPA blackout. Eventually, the lawmakers will make more compromises to the tech companies, and everybody will be happy. Except for the butthurt neckbeards who want to complain about everything while sitting in their basements doing nothing. 
 Google already owns every one of you, body and soul. Why not protest Google instead?
With regards to Obamacare and death panels, the SOPA debacle had a similar amount of FUD with respect to the argument that the government was going to take the internet away if SOPA passed.  The funny thing was that to protest a perceived attack on internet freedom (or free shit), websites shut down anyway.
  
French Transportation strikes are related in that nobody really cares what French transportation workers want, they are just annoyed that transit has shut down again and again.  Repeated political internet shutdowns would have the same effect.  
  
Tying them both together, you can and will end up with a situation where websites are being blacked out to "protect" the internet, when in fact the people attacking the internet are those blacking it out.  At that point nobody cares what you are protesting about because you are the ones getting in the way of the flow of information on the internet.  And all of this under the aegis of the government trying to take the internet away from us.  
  
 Obamacare: FUD about internet freedom; French Strikes: nobody cares about your cause if all you are going to do is annoy them repeatedly.
Maybe this is too devil's advocate for this straw-man styled post, but I'm diamond and here's a counter-perspective:

Are you familiar with "self-serving bias" and "fundamental attribution error?" Basically, if you do something well, you attribute it to yourself, and if you do something wrong, you can easily blame it on outside sources. 

For example, every now and then I'm playing monobattles with noobs on my team, and I have a not-so-useful unit. My team gets easily defeated, and the other team starts BMing us for being "noobs." But the other team is maybe all gold players. So now, I am on a team that is blaming each other for making mistakes or not defending THEIR base, and the other team thinking that they beat our team with pure skill. 

So I'm pissed at everyone. Not because I lost, not because I neeeed to win... but because everyone is flailing their internet-dick, and everyone is forgetting that winning or losing this one game does't say much about their skill. (In this case, I sometimes succumb to asking for 1v1s, which everyone is eager to do until they look up my match history.) 
This is distantly analogous to your post: Because he lost, he wants to attribute it to outside sources (random bad luck) and wants to make sure that you don't attribute it to your skill. It's not that he's being a dick because he's a higher league, or because "mean people BM;" it's because he can't let the possiblity of an attribution error go, and he needs to set it straight. (Taking the "high road" would be just allowing for the possibility that people will incorrectly blame their win on skill.")

Of course, in your OP, you make it plain that you know this, and his assumption makes an ASS out of him. I'm not saying it's cool to be a dick on the internet, and BM and so on--I think you should try to take the high road in this case--but if you have empathy then mabye this will make sense.

&gt;It would have been far less costly in terms of lives and resources, and the animosity that was created by the Reconstruction Era would have been minimized.
I very much doubt the validity of any of this sentence. Buying the slaves in itself would have tested the powers of the constitution as much the question of secession. It would have also required a massive amount of bi-partisan support from a congress that had already resorted to [savagely beating one another]( over the question of slavery.
Even with compensation, the southerners maintained slaves as their property, and would have taken offense at the forceful seizure of their "property". This doesn't even address the question of what to do with the millions of suddenly freed slaves who have no education, no prospects, and a back covered in scars from someone who has terrorized their families for generations.
You cannot wash away centuries of violence and humiliation that easily. Don't forget that [blood was already being]( spilled all over the nation before the war was even declared. There was no way this was ever going to end peacefully by the 1800's. 
&gt;relevant precedent
That is not even a remotely relevant precedent. Slavery was an institutionalized part of southern society. Most British slaves didn't even live in England, they were mostly scattered across Carribean islands—Islands that are still today known for violence, poverty and political instability.
**There was a tremendous amount of bloody fallout from the end of the English slave trade, it just wasn't anywhere that England had to deal with it.**
All the riots, terror campaigns, and mob executions that characterized the post-war south still took place after England bought out their slaves but it was localized to where those slaves actually lived—in the Caribbean islands where all the plantations were. If there were a million slaves in London, you would not be able to make any of these narrow-minded claims about peaceful transition.
***:The pot was going to boil over, there was no way around it. Most people who think there was don't realize they're parroting arguments from southern apologetics that have snuck into American education with the rise of the antebellum myths. 
OP you are an asshole, stop squeueing videos to make cops out to be bad, the bad people in this video are the protestors, if you actually look at the video you see them throwing things at the car, and the window is smashed, and the driver is slumped over, meaning the protestors threw things at the car breaking through the windshield knocking the man unconscious so the car goes wild and runs of the road.
And you say it is his fault.
OP is an asshole, use critical thinking for once.
Sounds interesting, but I'm going to disagree.  I was talking to my friend about the next Fallout installment a while back, and we came up with what we think would be the six best case scenarios:
The first option would be to take the game back to its roots and drop is into San Francisco.   
Obviously with our improved graphics and the standard of design quality set by Fallout 3, the environments here would be spectacular.  Picture yourself fighting your way up the tiered hills to reach your objective.  This would also add a level of interest if the designers chose to incorporate vehicles into this installment.
Idea number two would be to take the game out of the US entirely.   
The best option for this, I think, would be Venice.  I mean just imagine what a post-apocalyptic Venice would look like!  The world design here has the potential to be BREATH TAKING.  Plus, this would definitely prevent the game mechanics from feeling stale.  The only problem with this idea is, now that Dishonored is on it's way, we're about to get a Bethesda interaction with Reneissance era design and architecture.  
Next up is Tokyo.   
Hopefully I don't have to go into a lot of explanation on this.  The environment would be one the most exciting environments in fallout history.  Not to mention how fun and captivating the armor/technology designs could end up being.
The last non-US option would be a castle-strewn European countryside.   
Basically just because Fallout castles would negate my need to have sex with my girlfriend ever again. [Avid member of /abandonedporn here].  Plus, seeing medieval inspired armor/weapons and such would be awesome.
Finally, returning to the US, we have two options that tied in my opinion.  Either the swamp/bayou of Louisiana/Deep south.  Or a venture inward to heartland states like Indiana.   
The idea for the swamps came from the DLC in 3.  I just think a game made out of that would be interesting.  And the heartland idea would just be a complete change of pace from the giant crumbling cityscapes in 3.
In any case, I'm sure as long as the team that handled 3 is in charge of the next installment, we'll see something incredible.  But these concepts seem like the most likely options to me.
**EDIT TO  San Francisco, or Venice, or Tokyo, or Castles in Europe, or Louisiana swamps, or US heartland.**
Or they could do it like Fallout 3. You're a toddler when the bombs drop, and you see the hystetia play out only to have time elapse to you being in a vault or in a cave or what have you (your choice of "class" influences your origin). Then you leave said location with no direction. No pursuit of anyone, no real quests at all. Radiation actually changes your physiology. You can become a ghoul or a mutant. Your progression has to do with who you come into contact with, when you do, and how you handle them. An example would be if you turn into a ghoul and you come across the BoS then they'll likely shoot you on sight unless you have some sort of item/beacon that appears beneficial. Make brutality and chaos the norm. The bombs only dropped whatever amount of years prior depending on age. 
 Make the next Fallout take place in the chaotic post great war time period. Make the environment and choices more influential toward shaping your character. Basically, take the good from Black Isle Fallout and combine it with Obsidian Fallout.
Firstly its not a game in the sense that anyone can hope to win or loose. We played it in my board gaming group, and that was an idea we had to wrap our heads around, not really having played any role play games together. For me, it played out like a very complex, and super engaging theatre game themed around a Cohen brothers movie, or an episode of desperate housewives (as supposed to a typical RPG - played a bit of DND before). As someone who likes everything between theatre sports, board games and table top RPGs, to me this game was a really unique and awesome blending of all the above. 
I feel went down really well - although we've chatted since, and some of the players apparently didn't quite get into it.  There was 5 of us, and a 6th (who was rule reading as we hadn't cracked the book before we started to play, classic rookie error....).
Once we'd designed our character profiles however, there was a bit of confusion, as our rule book reading friend kept saying 'Just go! Get into it', and it took us quite a while to work out what 'doing a scene' actually entailed. Maybe because we're used to performance games more like charades where there are some rules to work with. There are no rules in this game really - again, i haven't read the rule book just played it, but it's been sent through to me in PDF and I'm give it a squiz before we play again. I think having the 6th player seudo DM to set the scene, provide rule book guidance, help us go into the second stage really helped. I know that the game is marketed as DM'less but if you have a sixth player maybe consider this?
Our story was kind of amazing once we got in the roll of it, and one of the guys in our group got heavily into character and made the whole thing hilarious. Really really enjoyed it. It did drag on a little long, but i think that was something we could have controlled better ourselves. Having a timer on our scenes (maybe another thing the sixth player could do?) could be good. 
Our story went something like this (feel free to skip reading this part, posted in the last fiasco thread i saw as well, but I think it demonstrates the limitless potential of this game in terms of creativity):
Playing with the suburban set. 
"*2 ex-lovers, Flamita, one a slightly crooked mexican cop who is also a gold digger / get rich quick schemist, the other, Max, a lawyer with hidden motives, meet up at the abandoned sugar mill (old trist hideout) to discuss an insurance fraud scam. But the female cop falls through the condemmed floor onto a pile of sugar (which turns out to be coke), and passes out badly injured.*
*Enter Max's love interest, Dr. Grey (no first name) who owns too many cats, and has a dark secret - she's dealing coke with an old failed italian medical school student from her glory days, Luigi, and they're storing it at the mill.*
*Max calls Dr Grey and she rushes to the mill to help give Max a hand with flamita who is badly injured. Meanwhile, luigi has turned up at the mill also, unknowing that Max and Dr grey are inside. Luigi sees the others and hides, Max doesnt see him but Dr grey does. Dr grey tells max to drive the car into the mill so they can put flamita inside and take her to the hospital. When max goes outside, luigi makes himself known, and he and dr grey discuss that flamita is actually a cop, and this could be really bad. They plot to kill flamita together, somehow. Luigi slips out unnoticed, and Dr grey takes flamita to the car and they drive to the hospital.*
*Meanwhile, luigis simple minded wrongly accused sex offender brother, Chad, drives up to the mill in his icecream truck (from which he sells his homemade gelato), to pick up some sugar (not knowing its actually cocaine). He brings his dog, spagetti. Chad gets the sugar, and makes up a batch of gelato in the truck on the way home. But spagetti is greedy and eats some when chad is busy driving. Obviously this makes him sick.
Now at the hospital, dr grey calls luigi, tells him to go meet his brother chad, and see if they can get him in on the whole murder thing, so that they can use the ice cream truck as an escape vehicle.*
*Luigi tells chad about the horrible mexican woman (playing off the brothers mutual hate for imigrants) and how they need to off her, but the brother is not convinced because he is too busy worrying about his dog spagetti who is frothing at the mouth and od'ing on coked up gelato. The dog dies, and chad realises it must have been the 'bad' sugar. Luigi capatalises on this and tells chad that the mexican woman flamita, has been the one hiding the drugs at the mill, and is thereby responsible for the dogs death. Chad recognises flamitas name, and explains that flamita is actually his parole officer and black market bussiness partner. It had always been his dream to own an icecream truck, but since the wrong full sex offender court case, he had not been allowed to work around children. But flamita cut his a deal - she had a brother who was trying to sell an icecream truck, and she would give it to him for free, so he could start his dream bussiness, but he would have to give her 50% of his profits. In turn, she would over look any parole violations he might be making. Chad realises that he must avenge his dog, and this is more important, and he help kill flamita.*
STAGE TWO STARTS
*They all meet up at the hospital, Chad has an epileptic fit, Flamita comes too while this is going on and realises they are probably going to try and kill her, so she jumps out the window and lands on a bouncy castle, before then running home to saftey. The coked up Dog spagetti, comes back from the dead and storms into the hospital room attacking Doctor Grey and ripping out her throat, and she bleeds to death. Luigi, runs out the door after Flamita, and finds her at her house where he kills her, and dissolves her body in acid. Unfortunatly loosing both his hands in the process. Chad however, recovers from the epeleptic fit perfectly well, wakes up to see spagetti, is overwhlemed with happiness despite the grissly scene, and lives happily ever after."*
In terms of our final dice rolls, Chad was the only character who ended up with a good outcome, maybe a 7 or 8? Everyone else died horrible deaths, really. It took us a while to create a 'fate worse than death' for Famita, but we thought the acid burning kind of got there. 
** I think my game group might be fucked in the head. But in a very good way. Would play again with anyone who hears the word 'theatre sports' and doesn't run away. Highly enjoyed it.**
Not particularly.  It's true her skill set is great and she is still a strong champion individually.  The problem is that there are many other top laners that fill her role *better* than she does.  She gets pretty stomped on by Udyr, Lee Sin, Riven, etc. and they fill very similar roles at every point in the game.  If you enjoy Irelia by all means, go for it. Like you said, she's still pretty strong - it's just not the best choice you can make in most situations.
This is coming from someone with 150 ranked games on Irelia (and at least a few hundred normals - I usually play w/ friends) @ a ~60% win rate in season 1.  Certainly not god-like but I know Irelia pretty well.  I switched to prioritizing Udyr when I needed to fill the bruiser/carry-killer role and my win rate on him is 72% this season while doing a job that is basically identical (smothering carries and absorbing damage).  Sure, Udyr does have a few general counter picks (slows like Nunu's iceball make it hard for him to jump on carries) but you have to try pretty damn hard to lose your lane.  He beats nearly every champ top lane. 
**** Irelia is still strong (her kit is innately powerful - it's one of the better skillsets in the game) but she's rarely the optimum choice for the job she fills.  Other champions fill very similar roles *better* than she does.  Udyr is OP as shit and does the same thing.  Riot nerfs Irelia 300 times instead.
It's entirely possible he's avoided acting overtly to the left on sensitive issues like that to avoid turning away any (extremely important) independent voters.
His standings among those who support coming down softer on illegal immigration and medical marijuana are high, and they are unlikely to abandon him for Romney over disagreement with these issues.
He's a rational politician. It's about winning the next election
so.  What's the tldr on that? 
I know the feeling.
Boosting your ego is going to be essential to get through the defense; you will not know everything, but being able to answer a question you're not sure about calmly and and confidently will help you try to come up with something logical and sensical. 
It was as scary as I thought it would be, but as soon as I started I forced myself to relax into it and was able to do the best I could. The most difficult questions I got were "big picture" questions that were aimed as testing my thought process, and how I could link 2 ideas together that maybe wasn't obvious in my thesis. I didn't answer everything perfectly, but I was able to make some logical connections  - this will only happen if you know your stuff, and are able to react calmly.
One of the best moments in my entire life, to date, was the moment when my committee members came back in the room, shook my hand, and congratulated me. I'll never forget that feeling. 
It was one of the most nerve-racking and trying experiences of my life, and also one of things I'm most proud of. Knowing where I started, and seeing where I finished, it was all completely worth it :)
- be calm, be confident, prepare your ass off, relax, push through, and then enjoy it :) You will do it, I know you will!
Red to yellow, kill a fellow. Red to black, venom lack.

Fair enough, I just mention it because my friend dealt with Verizon recently and did this.  His phone stopped working (making calls or something, I forget what the main problem was), took it to a tech support and they completely bricked it.  Wouldn't even turn on.  They then said it was because of "water damage" even though none of the water damage sensors were triggered.
Friend threatened to take Verizon to the BBB and they sent him a new phone
yeah, but complaining about its utility is not productive. If you don't think it's useful, be amish.
I imagine if the sentiment of the OP persists, we'll create an entire society of [Eloi](  who have no knowledge of the technology they possess.

Probably a long unneccesart story but I'm going to tell it because maybe someone out there will read it and share my pain: I grew up in Indiana and learned the foil method like most normal people and then my junior year of HS moved to North Carolina where they used a whole different method called the box method. To me, this method is a lot easier but it wasn't at the time and I had a really rough time grasping it and had to basically relearn all of algebra because of it. Basically everything my new teacher did was backwards from what I had learned in the Midwest (it wasn't just foil that was different, he introduced a lot of new ways to do stuff that I had previously done). This really wasn't the problem, but when it got into more complicated stuff, the fact that I was doing stuff so differently made it difficult to follow lessons. And then when I moved to another school my senior year I was moved back to the foil method. Which sucked and I just said fuck it because I was not going to relearn that shit.
learning is hard.
I was exactly where you are around November of last year. I drank every fucking day, earlier and earlier, before work, before school. I destroyed my marriage, everything was just falling apart. I woke up everyday just with this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and regret and being completely out of control. Even after this I would still drink again that night and replay the whole thing. I could not function with the hangovers anymore..I think my liver was just not able to handle the load any longer. Something happened not too long after and i just went ahead and decided that was the last straw (rock bottom I guess) and went to AA that evening and I told my situation and for the first time ever I was understood, by people who were not even drunk they had all been where i was at one point and they all seemed normal, and happy now. At that moment I had more hope than I had in years, and that's all I needed to get through that day. I came back the next day and felt the same. I had two relapses since then but right after I just forced myself back into a meeting the next day and eventually things started to make since to me. i've been sober 90 days now and I feel like shit has just gotten 100% better and the best part is that I feel like a person again and like I deserve to be happy now and before when I was drinking I just wanted to die but never had the balls to kill myself at once, just very slowly and painfully. AA was my last resort and I avoided it for so long, I thought it was going to be a bunch of old haggard looking dudes sitting around being depressing but I found all sorts of young ladies like myself who were just like me and had been even worse off but were ok now and I just started listening to them. I got over the whole religious thing, It's not really a religious program even it's a spiritual thing and I still don't know what I believe but if reaching out to something other than myself keeps me sober than that's what I have to do.
Sorry about the wall of text/rant 
I hope you get some hope, that's what helps me. 
As someone who already missed specific aspects of gameplay in D2 because I loved D1, I am really sad about the direction.
It is not that it isn't fun, but it reminds me more of Darkspore gameplay wise than D2 and specifically D1.
I don't like the feeling of always being overpowered, and only getting in danger when I am grossly misconducting (compared with D1 where every door could be your last).
I personally dislike that "skills" are the only mode of attack, and the way weapons and gear are in a way pure statsgivers.
And I very much dislike what they did with the skill interface and skill aquirering (specifically compared with the other beta implementations but equally compared to D2)
As for the potions/healthbubble debate:
I liked darkspores system, it makes for a more fluid system where errors accumulate over time, but I personally favour D1 potion-chugging, something that I already felt missapplied in D2 a bit. (although I loved the big rejuv farming for EXTREMLY harsh situations, and the idea that buying healthpotions where for "smaller errors" and the rare rejuvs for big things.
I miss the "tension" of D1 so much, the way darkness and light interacted with gear and buffs, the way you needed to trick range mobs, to evade danger, the hectic potionchuging when making a to hasty move forward.
D3 seems just to fluid and gameplay wise unaccented, which they make up with other elements, though.
But everything s visible, running speed is so high, the tetris inventory is meaningless because everything is 2slot vertical, the skillrune dropping is replaced by unlocking which is even more boring limiting in the beginning than D2's skilltrees (not that I criticise the skillsystem in generall, the swaping skills is cool, despite me favouring the "hotkey -&gt; modifies mousebutton" over the "press 1 for skill trigger" system, the selectionscreens being BAD, and the unlocking)
I like the iea of punishing the player due to lack of reaction-time primarily, and stealing their gold secundarily, rather than having a median spicky healthreg throughout the dungeon and backup potions on cooldown. For one it is just a "trick" to hide "healthreg", which imho should be a stat, and not a feature. For the other it makes lifeleech a lot less interesting a stat.
And as a hardcore player I HATE that they removed dropping skill runes and replaced it by unlocking them per level.
To conclude:
I love a lot about d3, i hate a lot about it, and in many areas I am just disapointed, but it will still be fun even if it is more darkspore than Diablo1.
I liked the more spiky experiance over the gradual one, and D3 will be a grudge-buy for me, which is doubly sad, because I neither really WANT that game as much as a different one, nor hate it enough to actually happily not buy it :( :( .


To answer your question:
D3 removes a lot of "things" that some players disliked, but as a D1 fan it isn't the direction I want, but the game is still fun in it's own way. Just sad that D1 is now entirely gone.
I do the same thing to my friend from high school, he's not the most outgoing guy, so i like to steal his jokes, say them louder, and then look him in the eyes and say 'shoulda said it louder, bro; was a good one.' I don't do this to be a scumbag though. I'm trying to teach him the lesson that you've learned, because when he's off in college, all those new people wont ever hear his quiet hilarity.
** Steve or Greg, it's a matter of perception.**
Damnit, wrote you a long ass reply  and forgot to hit save...
 Shit...:)
&gt;the rejection of all authority seems ludicrous to me
Why?
&gt;I feel strongly that people should be rewarded more for their contributions.
I agree. We do not need hierarchy in order to achieve this. You confuse commerce with capitalism. Owners are rewarded *more* than the workers, while workers are the ones doing the most contributing toward the success of the company. This is a backwards system in capitalist ventures.
&gt;If you can organize and manage a gigantic corporation that ships products around the world, you should be paid more.
This is where you overestimate the value of ownership. Most owners have very little say in the success of their ventures. They merely had the capital to begin things. After that, it's up to the workers. 
&gt; Is it 'fair' that the owner gets a huge estate, vacation homes, and a corporate jet?
I'm glad you saw that it's "no". However it's not just slightly "no", it's a huge **NO FUCKING WAY**.
&gt;The service he provided by creating the company, however, far outweighs the outrage that anarchists feel when they think about how poor they are relative to him.
I find that this "service" is negligible. We don't need him at all once it is started. 
&gt;Authority, in its many forms, seems contingent to the emergence of greatness and virtue 
Authority just holds us back from being able to realize our own greatness. It tricks people into thinking that they need someone else's permission to do something that they know is right. On this one can't disagree. There are those few people that are just plain dumb and can't do anything by themselves, but *more* people are far more capable of doing the right thing without being told to do it.
&gt;States can marshall and maintain armies (...) don't get comfortable.
Just because we're anti-war does not mean we're pacifists. Some of us are, but they're the minority. Most anarchists are very pro-gun rights, are very comfortable with defending ourselves even with violence. I fail to see how armies are necessary. They only serve to further war, not prevent it. 
Especially in America, we are more than capable of defending our home turf without the need of the US military. Every country in the world should be the same way.
&gt;The modern era actually makes anarchy even harder to fathom when it comes to the latest methods of warfare. (...)warlords frequently have even less respect for human rights than states.
How is this any different than what we currently have? Please describe how George W. Bush is any different than an African Warlord... Because his military is stronger? Because his military wins? Compare everything with what these "warlords" do to each other in 3rd world countries with what the United States has just spent the past 11 years doing in the Middle East and Persia... 
Same shit.
Different sounding name.
Obama isn't much better when it comes to his war record.
The existence of powerful nations make war terrible, it makes it a constant threat. Smaller nations constantly feel threatened by the larger ones. Other larger countries just escalate their armaments to compete against each other.
Look at how dangerous it became to be a human post WW2. There has never been a time in history when every single human on earth ran the risk of dying simultaneously. This happened because of two powerful nations trying to compete with each other.
Granted, now it's too late. Nuclear arms exist. But I'm actually fine with a rogue general with one or two nukes rolling around with the threat of using them over two (or the ten that we currently have) nations having thousands of nukes capable of ending all life on earth.
**TL:DR** Don't confuse capitalism with commerce. Don't think that because we're anti-war that we're pacifists.
Absolutely not. The "cleanliness" of a dog's mouth is irrelevant; Dog mouths are a very different microbial environment than human mouths, which is a much more important issue. The human immune system is accustomed to the bacteria that live on the surface of our skin and in our mouths, which gives us resistance to any infection they might attempt. The bacteria in dogs' mouths is potentially foreign to our immune systems, making it more likely to make us sick. 
Don't let dogs lick your wounds.
This article hit the nail on the head, in that AAA games need to have action these days and that horror is not terrifying when you can defend your self. 
Dead Space 1-2, FEAR 123, RE4-5, SH Homecoming, Fallout (ghoul zones and all), Metro 2033 etc.,scares are just obstacles such that after a while you say:
"Hey its awfully quiet and nothing has jumped out for a while, better reload."
The reason why games like Amnesia is scary for the common gamer is that it has taken that weapon away and you have to outsmart the enemy.
The original SH games do give you weapons, but if you keep taking monsters head on
 *"You will die."*-Shao Khan.

So then you have to run, which gives you that tingly feeling on your neck like someones chasing and about to grab you. 
 Man (or Woman) up and play a REAL horror game. Indie devs will always make great horror titles.
When I was a camp counselor a few years back, one of my campers learned to wash his hands before he would beat the meat. Now, what happened was that we were all coming back from a previous hiking trip and getting ready for bed. Allegedly, the camper started to masterbate (with all of us in the cabin) and had not washed his hands. Yet, to nature's avail, we had crossed several paths containing a variety of poison ivy's and poison oaks. The following day, the camper woke up with  a horrendously swelled sack and potatoes. Took him to the hospital, and sent him on his way.

Wash your hands if you're gonna fap ,man.
So then what is the difference between diffraction and light bloom?  
Diffraction is what causes "starbursts" in long exposures with small apertures, and light bloom is related to bokeh which causes light areas to expand when out-of-focus light is behind a dark subject.  
My understanding of it is: Diffraction happens at the aperture, behind the lens and causes "rays" having the same number of angles as the number of blades in the camera aperture. Bloom is simply an out of focus backround/foreground which causes points of light in the image to become circles of light.  
Unless you mean that his finger wasn't doing the diffracting, but the edges of the camera optics were.  
[Diffraction](  
[Bloom and/or Bokeh](  
 I wrote a paragraph to refute a single word.
Too long - Didnt Read 
If I see a block of blah..........................blah..................blah.............. I go to the TLDR if its an interesting question, then I go back and read the whole thing.  
tell you'r friend you are in a relationship with this girl. tell him you are aware of his feelings for her, and you are aware this will cause some tension in your relationship with him, and his relationships with both you and girl. but also tell him you have confidence that your relationship with him is strong enough to overcome this.

tl:dr;aj: threeway.
Yeah, I had a spiel about that but I couldn't finish my thoughts appropriately so I just deleted it.
80's was a place where most of us remember the awesomeness of Saturday Morning Cartoons.. Most of those cartoons are tough to watch now--but back then they were believable. 
Timing wise, you had the lesser titles at 6-7:30..but by 8:00am, the classics started coming on and on every network (NBC, CBS, ABC) there was something. It got better in the later 80's.. Canada added YTV to that mix. I imagine Nickelodeon was the US equivalent. You guys also had Family Channel (Now Disney Channel)

Now this is what a saturday morning looks like
(useless) ABC is all live content, nature shows basically
(useless) CBS only has "under 5yrs" demographic cartoons, followed by an adult morning show
(semi-useless) NBC tries a bit harder but doesn't start their saturday morning til 10, giving 2.5 hrs of mediocre shows (and Babar) until afternoon sports.
(Little better, not great) CW is playing the anime card. Sonic X, Dragon Ball Kai &amp; Yu-Gi-Oh!--not saying its bad, its just a cop-out. They are literally just doubling up the hour with popular anime series. More content required.
(best, but no competition) Cartoon network tries the hardest with the most variance in shows, but they're literally the only network you'd want to watch now. 
(Downright Shameful) Nick is basically spongebob all morning, with a couple other titles thrown in.
*** If its 9:00am on a Saturday morning and you do not like watching Ben 10.. you better like Spongebob, otherwise you are not doing anything fun until Thundercats


My boss had us go into his supervisors office while she was on vacation. we filled her fridge with candy, (i mean 100%full so it poured out) and then proceeded to seran wrap everything in her entire office. when we were done with that we filled up roughly 500 balloons and filled up her office with those, and the kicker is we taped a fist shaped dildo on her chair at the end.
 seran wrapped the bosses office and taped a fist dildo to her chair.
Language was invented so we could better communicate our ideas/thoughts with the people around us. Dogs, for example, don't need to say, "Go to the store and buy some milk," because food gets put in their bowl every day. If there isn't food in their bowl, then they communicate with body language (running to the bowl, scratching at the bowl, etc) and/or barking. Now if they're saying, "Hey, put food in my bowl, I'm hungry!" or just using noise to attract our attention, we don't know. Imo, dogs are just like babies. They use indecipherable sounds (crying/barking) to express a need for something. By tone, length, and pitch, we may be able to assume (and assume correctly) what the dog is trying to tell us.
Personally, I don't think any other animal aside from humans have invented spoken language. A dog has simple needs, thus it doesn't have a reason to say, "Don't forget to pick up the dry cleaning," or, "Slow down, there's a police car behind you." Dogs have X needs, thus they need to be able to express X feelings. Humans have an infinite number of needs, so they need to be able to form an infinite number of sentences.
 Humans are the only species that actually need a developed language because there's no end to what we need to be able to say.
I always say this: people in the US live to work, which sucks. I grew up in Mexico and people there work to live. At parties or when you meet people, people don't ask what you do, they don't care because that's not who you are.
I've been living in the US for some years and am trying to live by these principles but it's looked at as lack of ambition. I don't give a fuck, however, since I don't give a fuck about money. In all fairness, I make decent money, which is why I'm probably not thinking about it, but my dream is to make enough money to pay off my student loans and GTFO. 
One day.

God dam it guys! Stop downvoting everybody with links. If they have a 25 pointer and you don't let them use theirs as it's not about YOU it's about all of us trying to get beer money or money from sites. How about not upvoting? Keep them at +1 instead of 0. It just makes the 'community' look worse.

This just happened to me and a bunch of friends. We went to a park that was closed, cops showed up, told us to leave before the rangers came, rangers came, we got ticketed. The cops were really cool, since we were honest. They know that these laws are bullshit.
My friend said the weed was his and I said the bong was mine. He got ticketed for 2 nickel bags (when we had about a half an ounce). I got drug paraphernalia. I could face jail time if hey want.  We both have court next Thursday. We have no prior charges at all. We are working, college students. We are the nicest people you could meet. 
Hopefully, the judges take it easy on us and get rid of the charges completely.
 Tried smoking in park with group of people, park closed, cops caught us didn't want to charge us and wanted to let us go, park ranger shows up and tickets us. Took it easy on us to be fair. Court.
Anecodtally it was Sergio Ramos who Navas knew from his time at Sevilla that helped him work up to/handle being home sick while with the national team, I think on that issue he has improved a lot so national team tournaments/matches are not a huge deal, but I dare say really living somewhere else fulltime to play for a different club would be a totally different story, especially if it was outside Spain. Within Spain, from Sevilla the only step up would be RM or Barca. If RM, Ramos could definitely help with the adjustment period but honestly, why pry a good player from his home at the risk of messing up his mental game and having him not perform nearly as well? 
If Navas went anywhere it'd have to be Madrid, but doesn't make much sense for him to move. Be nice for him to get some more NT playing time though, especially with Pedro out of form.
That's certainly understandable, but at the same time, I'm sure there isn't a single person on the team, player, front office, staff, whatever, that was part of those teams from the 90's. For the record I'm young enought that I started following seriously in 2006. I've seen some sorry-ass shit, but at least there has been constant improvement. Point being, I don't think you can reliably use past failures as a marker for future ones.
As for the fans, I'm sorry you've had bad experiences. In our defense, we've kind of been through the meat grinder this past decade. We've been bashed left and right from the national media, local media, etc. Hell some of my earliest memories as a Blues fan was getting taunted by Cardinals fans. I mean, wtf? That leads to a certain degree of resentment and bitter feelings. Sure, there are some grumpy old men out there (probably on StLToday) that pound you into submission if you step outta line, but I've run into plenty of those in my attempts to get into baseball. I do my best to ignore them. Hopefully repeated success like we had this past season will soften the fanbase up a bit ;)
 I'm sorry you had to go thorugh the Keenan-induced blunt trauma in the 90's. That probably would've turned me off too. But even the Red Sox overcame everything. It's doable. And as to the fanbase, I understand, and hopefully you'll run into the right guys from here on out.
I've heard a healthy amount to lose is ~1 lb. a week, maybe ~2 lbs. if you're a lot more overweight. Assuming the same rule applies, I'm guessing up to ~8-10 lbs. a month is probably safe? And to gain weight, just eat a lot of calories. A lot of carbohydrates helps. Eat eggs and oatmeal for breakfast, pasta and chicken for lunch or dinner, and more pasta (different kinds, like spaghetti or alfredo or parmasean)... Knowing how to cook really helps.  
**Eat lots**
No, no, no and finally NO! Complaining about repost is against the rules. Think about it this way, the first time you saw your favorite gif was a repost, your favorite info graphic, your favorite picture was also a repost. So you post a picture and a bunch of the current user see it and upvote. But after a few months there are a lot of new user, or just different user who didn't see it posted on that day.
If you see a repost you recognize downvote and don't complain, if you haven't seen it upvote
Really awesome in so many ways:
- you got a sweet PC
- it was built by your girlfriend
- you have a girlfriend
- she knows how to build a PC / presumably is into this kind of stuff
- Lian Li case screams high quality and class, love the looks
- I'm envious but at the same time very happy for you, grats :)
[Here]( the amount of a 1% (w/v) caffeine/PBS solution absorbed transdermally was 2.6 ug/cm^2 per hour.  This is a high concentration solution and was done with with a patch applied continuously and directly to a hairless mouse.
So, the amount you would absorb over an entire day would still be sub-milligram amounts, when a cup of coffee typically has about 100 milligrams.
 Less than what's in a sip of coffee.
I don't understand. I studied from 9pm to 7am for a chem final, slept for about an hour and a half, took a different, easier final, came back and slept for a couple more hours, studied from 1pm to 7pm and took my chem final at 8:30pm. My grade on the final was a 62%. After studying for so long, I felt pretty confident and digested the information well, and no, I wasn't tired during the exam.
 Studied for about 16 hours. Got a 62% on my chem final.
I had a professor who, at one point at the end of the year, passed out an attendance sheet saying "I won't answer questions about antibody diversity from anyone who isn't here." I figured it was no big deal for me since I was front and center of every class.
After that lesson was over, the sheet stopped coming around. I was already accepted into professional school, and that school asked me to stop by to fix some things up for next year. I told her I would be out of town on Monday, and if there's anything I need to worry about "Nope, just get the notes from someone." No problem.
After I got the notes, I stopped by her office hours for help on the material that I missed. She tried the whole "You know what I said about missing class." I told her that I had not only informed her that I would have to miss ONE class, but I sat at the front row in front of her desk. Eventually, she decided she would help me out.
HOWEVER, I paid $1000 for access to the professor and material. I don't care if I missed every fucking class all fucking year. If I walk into your office hours and there's NOONE else there, you WILL fulfill your obligation as a professor and help me on the material. I can't STAND professors that will go on diatribes about students not wanting to learn and the punish students because they judge them as not worth of their time.
 *College* Professor decided she wasn't going to teach students she didn't think deserved to be taught.
This is exactly what I did - I am 25.
I started working as help desk for iiNet which gave me great troubleshooting / phone communication skills (which you have now too).
From there I moved to a SysAdmin role for a small family company that did home users and small business, not the best pay but because its so small you have to do EVERYTHING. I learnt a lot about Windows Servers, VPN's, Networking, Exchange etc etc. As I was also doing a lot of service calls/on site work I learned good communication skills, which will put you leaps and bounds ahead of people in the industry.
I then moved to a bigger company, around 40 staff as the SysAdmin there. They threw me in the deep-end on pretty much everything, and I had to learn under pressure and on the fly doing crazy big jobs for bigger companies. I got a few MS certificates doing this (SharePoint, Team Foundation Server - what ever I implemented there I did a certificate).
Now I work for a big oil company with 50000+ staff and get to travel around to different countries, all based on my experience and a few MS certifications and good communication.
*** Get some MS certs, work at some smaller business so you learn a wide variety of things. Push your self and work hard and under pressure. Setup servers at your house and practice.. live and breath IT. Get experience, get paid big. 

I agree. like I said, is topped watching half way in when they wear telling him to put his arms behind his back and he just wouldn't. As my edit stated, it did escalate quite quickly and end up more maliciousness then it ever should have.
I guess my point may not be in the same vein as what people here seem to be arguing. My point is: avoid confrontation, and shit like this won't happen (most of the time).
Chicken or the egg?
Work conditions and ethics aside, you also have to consider that Wal-Mart has a relationship with manufacturers that is similar to a mafia-ruled state. With Wal-Mart being the biggest retailer in the world, and for a lot of manufacturers their only retail source, Wal-Mart has the power to set the bulk price. These prices are often so low that manufacturers are forced to lower quality standards.
 Shopping at Wal-Mart is a vote for sub-standard products.
This is all to relevant to me, I am currently unemployed living in the Bay Area and a month or so ago I wanted to start a business to install fencing for ranches etc.  Having grown up on a ranch I consider myself to be well versed in installing fences and don't consider it a very complicated task, just labor intensive.  My father already owns an auger truck, so start up costs could be kept to a minimum. 
So I assumed that I would require a contractors license and incorrectly assumed that it could be obtained relevantly easily, boy was I wrong.
I found out that:
"-Licensed contractors must demonstrate at least 4 years of experience/education in the trade for which they are licensed, be fingerprinted, have an FBI background check, and be bonded.
-Anyone performing construction work in California that totals $500 dollars or more in labor and materials must be licensed by CSLB.
-First time offenders are often issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) for misdemeanor charges of contracting without a license or illegal advertising. The NTA carries a maximum of six months in jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine."
Did I mention that the application fee is $300? And the License Fee is $180? Not to mention another $50 in DOJ fingerprinting Fees?  And without official work history from a fencing company I have no way of proving I have 4+ years of fencing experience.  Pictures of fences I have installed do not count.
And on top of all this I need a bond in the amount of $12,500 and contractor bond companies are almost as fun to deal with as bail bond companies.  So needless to say, I am still unemployed.
TL:DR; Attempted to start business, still unemployed. 

&gt; the people that commented are the people that voted and the people that commented generally wanted it
That turns out to be untrue, if you mean that the people who commented generally wanted it rather than didn't want it. 
I read each one of the 330 comments in that poll thread and categorised every one as "for the spoiler rule", "against the spoiler rule", "isn't about the spoiler rule" and "is unclear if it's for or against the spoiler rule". Then I rechecked all the unclear ones in the context of their other comments in the thread and recategorised them as for or against if I could work it out. 
It looks like the majority of people in that thread that commented an opinion on the spoiler rule were against the spoiler rule (50.9%) rather than for it  (49.1%)  - i.e. 1 more person was against the spoiler rule than for it. 
The results are here

For these ones below it wasn't clear (to me) whether their comment(s) that mentioned spoilers was for the spoiler rule or against it. 
* FANGO - talks about polling a lot but also mentions that he doesn't subscibe in order to avoid spoilers because people are shits and would post spoilers anyway, which implies he would be for a strictly enforced spoiler rule - but he doesn't explicitly say it. 
* mazing - sarcastically implies is against spoiler rule but doesn't explicitly say it
* Sandy_106 - their comment isn't really clear (and that's what I'm testing: the claim that opinions in the comments indicate that people generally want the rule) but the context of the comment they're replying to implies they're for the spoiler rule
* GT2860RS - Does touch on spoilers once but no real indication of which way
* TheDugat - I interpret his comments both ways, depending on which presumption I use: if I presume he's for it his comment makes sense, if I presume he's against it his comment makes sense. Inferring from his comment about people not wanting change, if he doesn't realise that the spoiler rule has already been in effect for a while then he's probably for the spoiler rule, and if he does realise it's already in effect then he's probably against the spoiler rule
Looking at these five again, I could guess and say FANGO, TheDugat and Sandy_106 are for, mazing is against, and GT2860RS I can't work out. Using those guesses the results would change to being that 1 more peerson was for the spoiler rule than against it. 
These ones below suggested the r/starcraft system instead
* [splidge]( - suggests r/starcraft system without giving opinion on our spoiler rule proposed here
* [FEiN]( - suggests r/starcraft system but also seems to vaguely imply they're OK without a spoiler rule (i.e. against)
* [wormania]( - suggests r/starcraft system and then in another comment they are baffled by someone else that is themselves baffled by people that don't want the spoiler rule, which to me heavily implies that wormania is against the spoiler rule. They don't explicitly say it though. 
If I add those three (very vague and subjective) implications to the mix as well, the results would change to being that 1 more person was against the spoiler rule than for it. 
And the raw tally is [here](
**TL:DR** 
* The number of people *clearly* commenting was 1 more against the spoiler rule than for it. 
* Adding the 5 people that weren't clear and guessing what they were implying gives a different result: 1 more in favour of the spoiler rule than against it
* Adding the 3 that were suggesting another option and guessing what they were implying gives: 1 more against the spoiler rule than for it. 
Whichever result you use, the perception that the number of people commenting were in general for the spoiler rule is wrong. The most you could say is that it's split 50/50

Short version:
In the lat 90s, Europe was ready to move past it's cold war state and into a united economy. The key they thought was to create a unified currency, this would mean when France did business with Germany who did business with Italy, no money would be lost when currency was converted. It would lead to easier trade and less "lost" currency due to currency exchange.
What Europe was not ready to do though was unite under a single government. This meant that while they shared a currency, the didn't share a budget. There were rules about how big defects were supposed to be, but within two years no country was following that rule. 
This meant though that some countries built up more debt than others, yet it was also kind of the same debt since it was the same currency. This caused uneven stress on the different countries, and meant that if Greece failed to pay it's debts, it would affect the credit of healthy countries like Germany and Sweden who are very capable of paying their debts. 
Think how angry people in the US were about "bailing out" Wall Street even though it was needed to save banks regular people rely on. Now imagine we were bailing out another country's wall street and how much more pissed people would be about that. That's why Germany and others doesn't want to "bail out" Greece without a lot of conditions (and even passing that almost toppled the governing coalition), and those conditions are very unpopular in Greece.
If Greece still had it's own currency, with their back to the wall they could simply inflate their money to pay their debt. It hurts people's savings but it sometimes hurts less than sudden and large cuts in spending/increases in taxes. Germany and other countries don't want to go through inflation because it would hurt their citizens who did nothing wrong, but Greece doesn't want to be forced into cutting its spending/increasing its taxes to cover its debt.
 Because most of Europe shares a currency but not a budget, unusual and uneven stresses because of uneven debt never seen before are happening that could cause lots of problems for everyone involved. So people are worried because there's no good answer because this has never happened before.
Actually, and I didn't realize this, but someone linked elsewhere that "Naniwa" was a historical name for one of Japan's capitals when it was in Osaka. So, actually, the whole thing makes a lot more sense in that context. In any case, time for my wall of text because I'm getting everything off my chest. Shooting my load, if you will.
The fact that there is such animosity between nations in East Asia is not just Japan's fault. Nor is it just other nations'. It's partly a misfortune of circumstance. Nation's aren't people, and you can't think of them that way. And so moving on from war is a very organic process which comes in fits and starts and pulls and pushes, and this process was seriously screwed up in Asia for the reasons I mentioned in earlier posts. If China and Korea were democratic countries after 1945, they probably would have put more leverage on Japan sooner after the war about the ways it wasn't living up to its responsibility. But they weren't. The governments didn't really care because they had other priorities or didn't care at all, and the people's thoughts in China and Korea weren't going to be reflected at an international level because of the anti-democratic nature of their governments. Plus the political division meant that these countries weren't really linked together all. There wasn't a lot of exchange. That's one of the reasons why most of these historiographical conflicts exploded in the 90s and not far earlier, and with such ridiculous passion (and sometimes violence).
&gt; they have defended the fact that oh boy, alot of Koreans, and people in general, wont like this for justifiable reasons.
**The only point I ever really wanted to make** was that I think these justifiable reasons are less justifiable than people would like to admit. East Asia has a history problem but its *not just Japan's problem*. By which I mean, it's not just a problem Japan has to deal with. Yeah, it makes a lot sense. I totally understand. Getting your country fucked up that bad, I get it. But after a certain point, its just a grudge. But it's not a harmless grudge. It not something that exists in isolation. It's like an international feedback loop of retardation. Japan needs to put pressure on its domestic right-wing faction to go the fuck away, yes. If that happened, Japanese politicans wouldn't have to worry about appearing weak or unpatriotic to its conservative vote and the pandering would go away and a lot of issues would probably resolve themselves. And people living in Korea, for example, need to figure out who they're really mad at, what they're really mad about, and why they're actually still mad about it! Koreans need to figure out why they make people nervous about drawing a picture of a guy whos been dead for 400 years. Don't they want people to not worry about that?! 400 years! That's like 13 generations! That's a really fucking long time ago! And I think saying that they're angry because of its connections to imperial Japan is a cop-out. It's *easier* to say that. It sort of makes sense, right? Invading Korea, yadda yadda... But that's what makes it "easy". Because it's not the same thing. And saying that two events separated by 300 years of history, involving two completely different Japans and Koreas and completely different people is both horribly ignorant of history, but it appeals to an emotional response that is entirely irrational, sometimes dangerous, and **completely unproductive**. If you keep thinking that way, you're only going to have the same shit problems you've always had!
If this was 1950, yeah, you could say that Japan needs to "own up". You could put it completely on them. But all those people responsible? They're dead now. The Japan of today has done jack shit. You can't treat them like the same thing. Japan still has responsibilities- being respectful, not whitewashing history, all that good stuff. But they're not the same thing. Why should I feel bad for the slaves my great-great-great grandfather kept? Why should a Japanese kid feel the same way? I would expect him to feel empathetic. To have a sense of tragedy and regret that it ever occurred. Do I feel the need to apologize to the Japanese for the atomic bombs? No. Do I regret that it happened? Yes. Time passes. Life goes on. It is entirely unreasonably to expect people today to feel as connected to and responsible for shit that happened 3 or 4 generations before they were born! It's just unrealistic!
Nationalism is dangerous and it exists everywhere in East Asia because it feeds into itself. It doesn't make the nut-jobs in other countries less crazy.. it sort of does the opposite, and vice versa. I mean, killing pheasants in front of an embassy over some unlivable piece of shit rock in the ocean? Because the Japanese government puts out the same press release they do every year saying that Takeshima is part of Japan? Like every country does in the region for all of their silly territorial disputes? For what? *Maybe* some oil and fishing rights? What the fuck should the average Korean care about that? The answer is they don't. Instead Japan exists as like some kind of boogeyman or political scapegoat slot machine. It should be a complete non-issue. Who gives a shit, they control it! But instead, you have Korean groups putting up billboards in New Jersey and Texas of all places saying "Dokdo is Korea!" And the world echoes back... "We don't give a shit!" and "What the fuck is a dokdo?" Saying that its reasonable for Koreans to be so upset over these issues is a cop out. It embraces ignorance. Lets take Dokdo for example. Koreans use Dokdo as a nationalist icon and they see Japanese claims to the rocks as echoes of its militarist, expansionist past. Which, I mean, sounds very appealing doesn't it? The Japanese dogs are coming again to take our land! Not this time! Right? It's very emotional! But it's also dishonest. Most people in Japan don't give a shit, and the only reason Japan still makes those claims because it has to if it wants to keep its other territorial claims legitimate (Northern Territories, Senkaku, etc...). Why do you think China will never give up hope of assimilating "Taiwan"? Because a) the CCCP has banked its legitimacy on the image that it's the protector of unified China that expelled the last foreign invaders and letting Taiwan go would be felt as a huge failure by its nationalistic populace and b) giving up Taiwan (despite the fact that it is by de facto its own nation) would give legitimacy to other separatist movements (Tibet, Xinjiang).
**Teaching people to see things for what they are is not being insensitive (although that depends on how you go about it)**. And while its not necessarily for others to tell people to "move on" its not stupid to call people out for the irrationality of their behavior.
Japan's got its fair share of right-wing idiots, but these right wing idiots are also very often denounced and criticized. It's not like the crap they pull is *uncontroversial*. Letting people *in every country* persist in their ignorant, simplified conceptions of complicated issues like textbooks and Yasukuni shrine visits only makes the problem worse. People shouldn't be defending their right to hate others just because its convenient or 'feels right'.
**Hate less mah niggas!**
Fake Edit: Oops I think I pulled an Orb!
There's several reasons why:
1.  Cost
2.  Speed - CPUs and memory squeeze out every bit of performance, with as little power as they can.  Adding more unnecessary things will only hurt performance.
3.  We don't currently have the hardware for faster CPU-memory interconnects except to add more lanes of QPI, or Hypertransport, which might not even be effective in the future when faster/better hardware is made available.
4.  The overwhelming vast majority of people don't upgrade that way, or can't, because they have all-in-ones, laptops or tablets, you'd be optimizing at cost for things that 99% of people aren't going to do.  External connections *do* work in the way you want, and so do many internal connections such as SATA, PCIe and Power.
So lets say you ignore all this and design it anyway.  So you have a 2000 pin CPU.  What do you connect those pins to and how?  Do you connect them to the memory sockets?  Well okay, but those are DDR2, so you can't put newer memory in it.  Okay, I suppose you could make an 12 inch long "future-proof" memory slot that has a zillion extra pins that do nothing, but that adds a ton of traces which adds a ton of cost, and introduces a lot of extra latency.  All so that a few people can upgrade their memory to something that won't actually benefit the CPU.
 Engineers are designing for "broader scope of longevity" where it can benefit most customers rather than 1% of them.
First off, OneArmJack proposes a socket 5000. The number refers to the number of pins (connections) that the processor makes to the motherboard. 5000 is insane. It's hard enough to route ~1k signals on a 16 layer board. If you want 5k, you're talking about having a thick, expensive board with more layers than most places can manufacture. That ignores the size of the chip too. For a replaceable CPU, you have to take those 5k connections and get them to a pin or a pad (with the pins on the motherboard like Intel does). An LGA-1366 CPU is 1907mm^2, extrapolating to a 5k makes the CPU 6980mm^2 or about 83mm x 83mm (3.3 inches square).
Even if you forget all of those considerations, one of the main reasons why manufacturers don't do this is that to add in all this space for compatibility is that it would actually make things more expensive for everyone. If they leave all that space in their current design, they have to re-spin the chip to add the new functionality in anyways so why waste silicon on leaving in a 5 year old memory controller when they can remove it and make the new chip smaller which gives them better yields and makes the final product cheaper? In addition, you'd have to do the same thing for motherboards. You'd have to have DIMM slots for each type of memory that you want to support because as the memory speeds get faster and/or your densities change, the layout considerations change. So the motherboard manufacturers would be wasting space on one or more DIMM slot groups just for forward compatibility. To top it off, these motherboard manufacturers wouldn't be able to actually test whether their boards support the future memory types since *they don't exist yet* and therefore have nothing to test against to ensure compatibility.
To take your SATA example, the reason you can have compatibility is that serial communication is simple enough that you can use the same wires (data pairs and grounds) and just make better serial communication controllers to signal at higher and higher speeds while retaining the ability to talk at the slower speeds. You can't use serial communication between a processor and RAM. Well you can, but it'd be dog slow since we can't run at clock speeds fast enough to get the bandwidth needed. They could standardize on a bus width, but you still have different timings and voltage levels to deal with. You could standarize on a controller format and that's kind of what happened before the CPU manufacturers started putting their RAM controllers on their CPU die. With LGA775 you can select between motherboards with DDR2 or DDR3 support. The gains that AMD saw using an integrated memory controller were too great for Intel to pass up and so they followed suit.
The main reason though is the pace of progress and expected life of the product. A roadway is designed to last decades so it has all kinds of margin built in. Ethernet infrastructure is expected to last at least a decade (probably at least two) so it was built with future compatibility in mind. Also, adding a few extra copper wires to a bundle is almost infinitely cheaper than adding a few hundred extra pins to an ASIC. CPUs double in speed about every 18 months and manufacturing nodes get smaller. This combined with the fact that pretty much every transistor on an ASIC has to be accounted for in order to keep yield at a decent level means that it doesn't make sense to build future compatibility in to an ASIC.
 CPU and motherboard manufacturers aren't conspiring to get you to spend $200 every 3-5 years for new memory/motherboard. They have sound engineering reasons for operating the way they do.
I'll just copy what I said in a [recent thread](
To me that fan fiction has always been at best a piece of poorly written emotional manipulation, and at worst the thinly veiled wish fulfilment fantasies of a disturbed mind. It's motivations and execution are comparable to those of a kidnapping. The protagonist makes it clear early on that he does not wish to meet Rainbow Dash, but own her.
&gt;*"There have been times I wished I had my own Rainbow Dash, or more realistically a plushie of her, to curl up in bed with."*
The point here is that he doesn't view her as another person, but rather as an object of emotional support. The setting is contrived to justify the conditions by which she is made completely emotionally and physically dependant on him. From infancy she is denied any contact with another living soul, the outside world, or knowledge of her origin; allegedly for her protection. The protagonist is the only sentient being she is ever allowed to interact with. These behaviours can be justified away to some degree if one imagines the protagonist as a victim of his environment. But remember that it is the same author who created this environment in the first place. The protagonist is absolved of blame in the eyes of writer and reader by responsibility being moved to the blameless universe. I hope that gets my point across.
 Poorly written wish fulfilment story that gets more disturbing the more you think about it.
In addendum regarding the amateur film(s) based on this fan-fiction, I do worry that if successful they may shift the outside perception of Bronies in an undesirable way by associating them with the aforementioned work(s).
I would suggest possibly a limit to the level you can enchant and making it a level 20 max with protection 2 being turned into protection 1 if you get it.This would let people get optimal enchants on there gear much quicker.With this in place there could be the mob limit plugin put in that would only allow you to have x amount of mobs in 1 chunk.It might still cause a little lag but thats the reason for donations and upgrading server hardware :p.I mean what server can run 20 tick rate 100% of the time with 0 lag on a crazy high FPS non stop, its a nice goal but it can't possibly be achieved without a insane hardware for the server or removing some natural elements of the game.Now getting back to the part of enchants....being able to enchant at level 30 only and a max armor enchant of prot 1 would solve a lot of things.Unlike a set of full protection 2 protection 1 can be gotten at level 1 and dose not max out the amount of EPF you can have.This causes more damage to be taken and less time to enchant.Now to get on to tools, at level 30 tool enchants you can grab your basic silk touch and i believe up to unbreaking 3 and efficiency 3.As for fortune enchant level 1 would be common level 2 would be rare and level 3 would be VERY RARE I'm talking 0.24% chance rare.People may say "But now we can't get enough diamonds" well your sort of wrong sort of right, With protection weekend it won't absorb much damage = less damage to your armor and getting more bang for you diamonds which ultimately = less diamonds.As for the rest of things you use diamonds on you won't waste 400 diamond son swords that you keep going for a OP sharp V fire 2 looting 3 that you have a 1.24% chance of getting.This would ultimately lower the same game stats to what it is now on a more noob friendly level.Sharpness 3 is the highest sharpness possible at that level and a sharpness 3 fire 2 is only 3.98% at level 30, going back to the sharp V fire 2 looting 3 god sword its about the same % as getting a sharp 3 fire 2 looting 3 at level 30.Add a few potion delays and maybe instant health 2 again and over all this would be a nice noob friendly add on :).(Bows would need a nerd though as they already can deal about 6.5 hearts to prot 2 in prot 1 thats a 1 hit)
Now to the problem of getting more people to events.Events of course would have to have a tone down in mob damage and rewards.Some things that could be good would be getting a fortune 3 possibly or maybe just maybe a sharp 4 fire 2.(this seems op to protection 1 but believe me coming from a server were there was no grinding and people had 1 sword they loved for life they got from donating this being a sharp V prot 1 let you live and win if you knew what you were doing)Another big prize at this point i would say would also be ender pearls since looting 3 would be the best looting you could get and it only having a 3% chance would be very good for a lot of factions that go through a stack a fight.With rewards that are good editions to even the newest of teams that a lot of new played could compete for would be very strongly to adding more action in events.
 Go fucking read it its got some good points in it!
I think you're nervous about the gender lines being crossed. The term I use: effemiphobia, is the fear of everything feminine, especially in men. Ask yourself why it's so bad for a man to act like a woman? 
Do you get sick around tom boys or girls who have masculine traits? 
Do you believe in equality of the sexes? 
If yes to both questions, than why is it okay for women to act manly, but not okey for men to act girly?
You sound like you're really trying to overcome your bigoted childhood programing. That's not always easy. Chances are you got some really serious messages as a young child that girly traits in boys is absolutely never okay, which is why your reaction is so severe as an adult. 
This may sound totally lame, but try imagining little kid you when you were taught this erroneous lesson, step in and tell your little kid self that your parents, though well intentioned, were totally completely wrong. Tell little kid you that boys and girls are equals, that there's no shame in being like a girl because there's no shame in being a girl. 
I'm a straight girl and I had to do this because my parents relationship definitely gave me the message that girls were weak and stupid and easily victimized. I was afraid of my own femininity for years until I was able to look at it in this light. 
 If men and women are truly equals then there should be no shame in  in being a girl, or being like a girl.

I probably won't pull this out if I get pulled over, to be honest. 
I've never been pulled over (knock on wood), but if I did, holding or not, I'd just go through the motions until it gets out of hand. 
If a cop pulls you over, asks for your license and registration, and you give this to them, it seems a bit suspicious, no? 
Here's my tip: Memorize the card. If a cop pulls you over, give him your license and registration, and do whatever he asks. If he starts asking questions and you get flustered, then tell him you don't have to talk. If he asks to search, say it's in your right to refuse. If he is holding you, say for dogs, tell him he can't hold you, and if you're not under arrest, you can go. If you get arrested... You get the point. 
You seem like your hiding something if you give them this and remain completely silent. 
 Memorize the card, and recite the necessary parts when needed. 
IANAL but you can't invoke your Miranda rights UNTIL you are in custody and they know they're going to ask you questions - which happens when they give you your Miranda rights and not a second before (unless they just don't give them). if they just pull you over or stop you on the street to ask you a question like they can every other person, you can blabber on about your rights and how you know them and wish to use them...but you should probably just turn around and try and walk away. the second they put a hand on you to stop you BAM - go into your speech.
the end of the card makes more sense to say first (ask if you're free to leave or try and leave slowly) since if you're free to go all that other shit is just you wasting your time
Your ass looks like it would feel like a cloud...
 NICE FUCKING ASS 
We already have laws on the books that allow the police to arrest or detain violent protesters, protesters causing vandalism, people who are participating in a riot, looting, remaining in an unlawful assembly etc...
Why make obscuring your identity a crime when you could make sentences for riot related crimes stiffer when you obscure your identity?
Say I'm in a protest outside of the embassy of my oppressive home nation. I'm showing my discontent and trying to get the Canadian government to take action. I have family back home and I do not want them to face reprisal, so I wear a scarf. The usual agitators show up and start trouble and the assembly is declared unlawful. Should I be arrested, and face the possibility of 10 years in prison? (I may be found not guilty, but I will have to endure my name being tarnished and spend thousands of dollars on lawyers and hundreds of hours dealing with the legal system.) However, if I'm arrested for smashing windows and I have a scarf over my face, we could make the sentence stiffer.
Why is protecting your identity important? In the days before the internet you could go out into the street and unless a police officer demanded you identify yourself - or you did so willingly - you could be anonymous. If I traveled from my home city to Ottawa to protest I was just an unknown face in a crowd. I had no worries of an employer or anyone else getting word of my actions. In the age of permanent, web hosted, on demand video; cell phone cameras; and rapidly developing facial recognition systems - everyone may know that I was at a protest.
Taking to the street and calling for policy change shouldn't be the business of anyone.
Why?
The same reasons that our ballots are private. Who we vote for, what we vote for, what we individually and personally support is no business of the state, our employers, or anyone but ourselves. Coercion is a very real threat in a democratic society. 
If I work for a fishery and I want to participate in a protest for stricter environmental regulations on fisheries - should I have to risk my job to exercise my rights?
*** make sentences for committing riot related crimes while masked stiffer instead of criminalizing masks themselves.  
There's lots of good advice here.  I'll add how I ended up doing it.
In the summer of 2003, I went to ROTC "basic camp."  I had never really run before but had to be able to run two miles under 16:36.  So I went to a .25 mile track and ran that pace as far as I could. At the beginning, that wasn't too far.  Over the next three weeks, I just kept it up and was able to run a bit further every time.
When test day came I finished my two miles with a few seconds to spare.  I started training at a pace equal to that time but only 80% of the distance. So I aimed to run 1.6 miles in 16 minutes or about a 10/min mile. 
Every month, my ROTC class would take another test. I would re-figure my 80% pace and just focus on keeping that pace. By the end of second semester, I was running two miles at 13:45 and training around 8:30/mile.
**** I guess what I'm saying is you need to figure out what's your maximum effort and train at some reasonable percentage of that.  Test yourself every so often and re-calculate.
Interesting question to answer. I started running at age 15, was about 5'8 and 185 lbs. Back then, couldn't run a single mile. Got progressively better, putting in about 20 miles a week at most during those first couple months. However, I always seemed to take a walking break. Grew to about 6' and lost about 20 lbs by the time my spring training rolled around. I ran over the summer, about the same mileage as I had before. By the time season came around (so 1 year total of running) I was at a 23:45 5k. That's when I noticed that I had seriously dropped some time (29:21 5k was my best the preceeding year). 
For me, took about a year to notice I increased speed. 
Mechanically, Dead Space 2 is (unsurprisingly) superior in most ways. Controls are smoother, guns have more variety and are simply more useful (Personally I've never enjoyed any weapon in 1 as much as the plasma cutter, to the point where in most of my playthroughs I've never bought another weapon, but in 2 I routinely carry 3-4 weapons), and the necromorphs are more varied. In this regard, DS2 did exactly what a sequel should do.
And yet DS1 is a much better game.
First and foremost is the character of Isaac. In DS1, he is a blank slate, with no dialogue, and only in the opening and ending cinematics does he do something you don't have control over. And yet he is a remarkable character. 
For some, he is a projection of the self-- Dead Space is incredibly immersible, and a number of fans I've known said that they feel like they *are* Isaac when they really get in the zone. EA had a stroke of genius here with the RIG system, allowing a necessary UI to exist, for Isaac to be aware of it, without breaking the fourth wall. And because you do have such a lion's share over the control of character, without encountering things to snap you out of the zone, it becomes easy to feel less like you're holding a controller and more like you're in a dark hallway, that a wrench was just knocked out of a toolbox and clanked against the metal floor, and that your grip on your trusty cutter is tightening.
But more than that is that Isaac's actions throughout the game tell a story of who he is, and who he becomes, as he deals with the infection of the Ishimura and the gradual realization of the implications that come with it. The first time you play through Dead Space, and you encountered a corpse, you probably left it alone. Maybe you toyed around with stomps, but even in a video game there is an uneasy feeling about desecrating the dead in such a way. But then, you learn of the infectors. Suddenly, there is no denying it. As much as you-- Isaac-- may have wished otherwise, necromorphs happen when there are dead bodies around. The only way to prevent them from being transformed, or at least to keep them relatively harmless if they are, is to sever their limbs. You take on the heavy burden of destroying these people to save them from the even worse fate of having their bodies used to kill and infect others. You realize that if you should die here, you will be in the same position as these people are, waiting to become one of those *things*. You find a few survivors throughout the ship, but nothing anyone is saying really makes sense. Are they trying to use you? Are they even there? You know the people of this ship have been hallucinating! It's something in the air, causing it. But, what can you do? You can go along with them, or curl up and wait to die, to become one of *those things*. But throughout the ship you do have one thing to go on, you slowly piece together just what exactly happened, through text and audio logs... And it's reaffirmed through these very logs that these necromorphs had people they loved, that they cared for. And they likely were forced to kill these very same people... Better be extra certain about the dismemberment, maybe take off the head too. Yeah, that should do it.
The ending, without spoiling too much, was particularly poignant. You came to the Ishimura expecting a simple repair job, and leave thinking everything you know is wrong. About the CEC, about the Unitarians, about the military, and about your own sanity. You've sunk to depths you had no idea you were capable of, or maybe you were there all along? Holding back those urges to be a respectable member of society, and the Ishimura allowed the real you to surface. Violent, ruthless... thorough. But most importantly? You came with everything, and you leave with nothing but your own flesh and blood, and you can't even be sure of that anymore. The story is the complete and total dismantling of a man, in a game that turns men into empty shells, relentless monsters bent only on creating more of their kind.
In Dead Space 2, and I will give the spoiler warning now because I simply can't talk about it otherwise, the story works in reverse. You begin locked up, strapped to a wall in a straight jacket. As the prologue progresses, you regain your physical sense of self. Your legs, your arms, telekinesis, your trusty cutter, your stasis module, and finally, your suit. In a matter of minutes, Isaac is restored physically, cementing the first step of reestablishing his identity.
Once again, he is forced by circumstance to rely on others for help and guidance. Interestingly, as each group finishes their role in restoring Isaac's mind, they are promptly discarded. Several die within moments of the completion of their role. His dementia is a special case. Every case ties back to the Ishimura, where he was stripped of his humanity. And yet, mentally, he is stuck there. As he fights to repress it, it continues to fill more and more of his mind, especially when he's forced to return to the ship. As the dementia becomes all-consuming, Isaac stops fighting. He accepts that he's been made into nothing, and from that point can begin to rebuild his mind going forward.
Ellie serves to provide a source of humanity that Isaac can believe in, to believe in something worth fighting for, and to aspire to return to. An entirely new character, yet embodying so much that he believed in-- A CEC pilot that just won't give up, representing the unflagging resolve of the human spirit. She sees the horrible abominations caused by the marker, and yet she keeps going. Near the end, he sends her off on a shuttle, intent to make sure she survives, if nothing else.
Isaac confronts the marker through his dementia, freeing himself from the hold it has over him. While heavily scarred, his mind is restored to as it was before the Ishimura. As the world literally falls apart around him, he feels at peace, and seems to accept the inevitable death awaiting him. Ellie swoops in and rescues him, and this time, he feels worth saving. He leaves Titan with a new life ahead of him. It won't be an easy one, especially with the information revealed in some late-game logs, but he can approach it as a whole human being.
 DS1 is a game about breaking down a man, and DS2 is a game about building that man back up. While both are good games, DS1 is a much better horror game.
Actually no, the magnet school was shut down due to overcrowding.  It is in no ways selective, and the application process? What are you talking about.  It is the top public school in ATL but that doesn't really mean a lot.  If you read more you'd have hear about the huge cheating scandal that ripped though our district.  Please stop telling me things you think you know about my school.  
Im in no way complaining about my school, I love it a lot.  I have a lot of learning up and growing to do. Yes thats true, i really have nothing to hide here on the internet.  I don't submit things that I wouldn't show to my mom, or that would be deemed illegal by anyone.  I don't like you're attitude. This isn't a stupid picture, I think its pretty funny.  Please develop what i like to call a sense of humor.  
why do you think you know more about my school then I do?
In my experience (I don't have a kid, so don't lynch me on this, but I've cared for other peoples' kids), saying "We need to talk" automatically switches people onto the defensive. If you go ahead and ask your question "Can you or the doctor explain x to me?" they are MUUUUUUUCH more receptive to vaccine inquiries. It was my first time taking care of an Autistic boy and when I took him in for shots, I downright 3rd degreed the doctor and nurse for almost an hour, but they were super friendly about it, whereas if I had presented the situation as an ominous criticism, they surely would not have responded in kind. Works in relationships, too!
*** "We need to talk" puts people on edge.
it's the fear of this that makes me hesitant to tell many people about my depression.  I can't always say my life is 'bad' and that is why I have these thoughts, my thoughts are just persistently neurotic. I've been dealing with my depression for about a decade now, and I was in and out of therapy/meds up until now, where I'm finally realizing I need medication and therapy and there's no way around it.
depression isn't about how bad your situation is, or the obvious triggers for your depression.  Depression is when you're either unable or unwilling to deal with whatever issues you are facing no matter how large or small.  Depressive thoughts come about when pain exceeds the means to cope with pain.  Some people have healthy brains, their innate ability to cope with pain may be higher than yours.  This allows them to experience 'real adult-life problems' without having the same depressive reactions you have to simply waking up on the wrong side of the bed. I've made two attempts in my life, and one of them was a result of waking up hating everything and everyone around me, getting drunk, and seeing the guy who my girlfriend of a year cheated on me with and having him act like he didn't know what I was talking about or who I was when I've conversed with him in the past before I was aware of what was going on.  From having been in a bad mood all day, being intoxicated and the night wearing down (which tends to trigger neurotic thoughts all on its own) to being indirectly insulted by a man who disgusts me, I finally gave up, and tried saying goodbye to a few people before taking bedsheets to attempt to hang myself.  I was found by my friend before I finished tying the noose on a tree in the back of campus.  Are these particularly serious issues? waking up in a bad mood, seeing someone I don't like and being insulted by them, or even being drunk?  perhaps the last one may be, but I've woken up in bad moods before and seen worse people and had worse insults slung in my face, faced harder situations, etc.  At the time though, I simply stoped valuing my own life, saw no reason to continue living since I had felt that happiness had not existed in my life for a long period of time and felt little chance of being able to feel actually happy. The things that normally would stop someone, friends, family, etc. I held little value towards and argued with myself that essentially, if I were to be dead, I do not have to deal with the pain of having possibly hurt these people.  Furthermore, at the time, I felt that the majority of those people didn't 'know' me or care much for me.  I still feel this way about many of them, and some have said otherwise to which I believe...to a degree.
but I digress a bit, my point is, what triggers depression is irrelevant.  That is my story, that is what triggered me not long ago, and thankfully I am now on medication and have found a source of happiness that reminded me that I can be happy.  Even if that source disappears, I will still be appreciative of the fact that I was able to be reminded that I can be happy, and that while my thoughts may be persistently neurotic at times, I do hold the capacity to be happy.  I find that my environment was irrelevant to what caused me to want to kill myself, I just wanted to escape my own thoughts, my own head.  I wanted to just be rid of everything.  That which triggered me I will readily admit seemed melodramatic and I would have expected more out of myself as someone who is a young adult and has been out of high school for a few years now.
I know that feel, been dealing with depression for over a decade.  That which 'causes' or 'triggers' the depression is irrelevant to the validity of that feel.
well, the fact that Cruddace wrote it didn't help either. Space Wolves came out a year before Tyranids so he could have easily done **something** about it. As for the Venoms... well it seems hard not to see that was gonna go somewhere bad so I can't argue against it. But once again I feel like a skilled Codex author could have figured something out for keeping his infantry alive in a codex that is **literally** ALL infantry
Cruddace is just as blameworthy here if not more
NIIIIIIIIIICE. hehehehe very few people will know this. (and I'll elaborate here. that's an aeon, which you find out in final fantasy X is a person who gave there life for someone and became a being of great power and can be summoned once they acknowledge a summoner as someone they'd like to be summoned by.) This aeon is a secret one that had been used against you buy a guy named seymour who isn't a summoner. later you find out by getting this aeon and going back into it's chamber near the end of the game that this aeon is seymours mother who became an aeon to give him power.
this is seymours mother.
I don't know. I could continue to slave away and try to squeeze pennies from books and some tv, or sign a multimillion dollar deal to pitch some soup. 
Hello soup!

Dude, this post is 5 months old. I don't care one way or the other anymore. I'm not implementing Windows 8 at work and Server 2012 is a ways off. By them time we move to Server 2012 Microsoft will have re-enabled the legacy desktop via a service pack. 
Pointing out your repeated spelling errors does not make me a "grammar nazi."  Grammar and spelling are two different sets of rules. Hoping that folks will be more professional and careful in their posts on r/sysadmin does not make me a "grammar nazi." It makes me somebody who considers this space a place for professional communication rather than another forum for lackadaisical spelling and grammar. I also try to avoid name-calling and childish insults because this is a professional forum. I'm sorry you missed that in the sidebar. 
 Correcting spelling is not correcting grammar.
&gt;The problem with being myself is that I'm naturally withdrawn and if I just play video games all day I will never meet girls.
When I say be yourself, I don't mean the self you don't like. Be the person who wants to talk to more people and meet girls, as that's what you said *you* want to do - well find that person and be them!
&gt;Even when I'm out with friends I still would much rather talk to the people I know than the people I don't.
 This is good stuff, to be more outgoing and talk to more people - but for what reason. Seriously if you don't need any more friends, then by all means hang out with the people you already know. A strange bonus is that you'll make friends anyway. 
EDIT: It's also common for everyone to talk to who they know simply because they're more comfortable being around people because (insert reason here), but you can learn to be comfortable around strangers if you'd like.

It's good you want to change, but firstly what's wrong with who you are now? I'd say it's obvious you haven't thought much about this, because you're going about it the hard way. 
Changing yourself isn't always a fun thing to do, but making change an ultimatum makes the process much more difficult to accomplish. Figure out who you are first, then you'll be better prepared to devise of a way that allows you to meet more people, a way that actually suits your style. Then talking to people won't suck as much.
***
What you are doing is not in congruence with who you are, therefore what you want to accomplish takes that much longer. 
I'm guessing it's to allow them to keep the pistol on target during rapid movements.  
When holding a pistol normally, pistol movement will generally be up-and-down.  This coincides with the bouncing motion of walking/running which throws off your aim.
When holding a pistol ***~~TACTICALLY~~***, your muscles want to move left-and-right, but the movements you are making are generally up-and-down.  So your pistol should move less when you are moving.
However, you still have a shoulder, so it probably doesn't do a damn thing.
**** Tactically doing tactical things with tactics.
On Reddit: They use similar tactics to SRS. Massive vote brigading (or botting) and invading threads, making arguments ad hominem, and circlejerking in unrelated threads.
In real life: I could write a bunch of stuff, but here are the basics:
I believe that the modern state should take over some basic functions. For instance, I think even libertarians agree there should be some kind of law enforcement to protect my life and my property. Why should it not also protect me when I have, say, a heart attack? What if I get ill and can't work any more? What if I simply lose my job and can't find another?
Then there are things that are simply much more efficient when done by a central authority, such as roads. Yes, you could have only toll roads, but that would both be a nightmare to collect (especially with the privacy implications) and it would be rather problematic to have five two-lane roads next to each other instead of one ten-lane highway. 
Yes, I know the founding fathers didn't account for universal health care, but they also didn't account for stuff like emancipation. Society evolves, and so should the role of the government.
A second point libertarians often make is to distance themselves from "corporatism". The problem is that libertarianism directly leads to corporatism, simply because of natural monopolies and oligopolies and the principle of economics of scale.
Are you going to be able to compete against Wal-Mart, using the same concept? No, simply because they sell so much they can buy a lot, and get bulk discounts much higher than you could ever get. Once Wal-Mart is in this position, they can only lose it if they either make a completely bone-headed business decision or the entire sector is going down the drain.
Related to that is that while it's hard to start poor and end up rich, it's much harder to start rich and end up poor. As long as you don't make any bone-headed decision, you'll stay rich.
While their wealth is not as visible any more as it is divided between a number of descendants, and they were eclipsed by others, the Rockefeller and Rothschild families are still filthy rich.
If you have a million dollars, you can invest that into a business venture. If you get back 1.01 million, you've made a profit of 10.000 dollars. If you don't have the million dollars, you can borrow it, but you need to pay back 1.05 million dollars. If the business venture makes 1.01 million dollars, you've made a loss of 40.000 dollars, and the guy who loaned you that money has made a profit of 50.000 dollars.
Wealth creates wealth. At some point, money doesn't come from your own work any more; it comes from the work of your ancestors and people who are working for you. You're essentially getting money for nothing. At this point, you could give the money to any reasonable person and they'd suddenly start to make more money without ever having worked for it.
To prevent a small elite sucking up resources for essentially nothing in return, you need to allow for wealth to be lost over time, or not be gained in masses in the first place.
Finally, the man is not some kind of perfect economic robot. If I can buy product X for $10 at my neighborhood store, or drive an hour (gas and car depreciation: $5) to buy it for $1, I'll still elect to buy it at my neighborhood store because while I might spend $4 more, I gain an hour to use on whatever I enjoy, even if that's a bad economic decision.
 Libertarianism is a pipe dream that doesn't work in reality.
Regarding "personal integrity" of Paul: For some reason, this argument keeps coming up although he has actually shown the opposite when it came to gay marriage by co-sponsoring the Marriage Protection Act, which runs directly counter to his otherwise reasonably consistent position of "states' rights". In essence, he's for states' rights, except when his religious beliefs make him not like those rights.
I'am sorry for the redditors who haven't played GW1 so...
In Prophecy the Charr ruling class ( The Shaman class ) thinks the Burning Titans are their god. I, because I truly am a badass, went and destroyed the power of the Titans.

Then the Shaman were sad pandas because with their "gods" destroyed they didn't really had authority anymore so they decided to follow new gods : the destroyers. Unfortunately I, and my companions which only slowed me down, because I was bored decided it was time to piss the charrs - again - and destroy the Great destroyer ( take that Primordius )

The Charr are a bunch of losers, they lost against the Ancients, then against Adelbern, then against me, then against the Dragons...

You can see for yourself what Ghazali says about Mathematics. 

TL/DR: Tyson is wrong.
Alright, this is not an excuse, but from a historical viewpoint, the Nobel Prize only started at the beginning of the 20th century, well into Islamic civilization's decline, followed by decades of occupation by the colonial powers and then decades more of questionable autocratic rule of Islamic lands. It is not surprising therefore that muslim lands tend to be lacking in the contributions to the sciences in modern times. Again, not an excuse, but an explanation of the Nobel Prize criticism.
____________________________________
On to your first question: AlGhazali was an interesting fellow and had a very interesting relationship with science and skepticism. In fact, it can be said that AlGhazali supported scientific progress in the muslim world, even encouraging avenues of research considered taboo, [such as human dissection](
AlGhazali was in fact a renowned polymath and philosopher. The reason people sometimes think he was against science is because he was very against Greek philosophy and his crowning work "The Incoherence of Philosophers" was a direct jab at Aristotlean metaphysics. He wanted, through his works, to steer Islamic philosophy away from Greco-Roman themes to more Afro-Asiatic methodology.
The basic gist of his philosophy of [occasionalism]( is that it is not scientifically correct to derive causality from even mundane events that are highly correlated. For example, bringing a cotton ball to a flame and the ball burning happen together all the time. He simply draws out this example and says that it is not correct to say the fire causes the cotton ball to light up. He says God does. God, according to AlGhazali is the cause of everything happening and the fact that he chooses to do things together makes them look correlated. 
None of this contradicts observable phenomenon. AlGhazali did not say you cannot deduce scientific "facts" from the study of nature. He simply changes the framing. He didn't want to widen the schism between religion and science. He wanted to bring them together. He wanted to replace the western thoughts of "whatever I cannot understand is a mystery known only to God" with "whatever I discover is proof of the wondrous order of God".
I may be building castles in the sky here, but in my belief, had AlGhazali's ideas made it into mainstream philosophical thought, the schism between science and religion, secularism and orthodoxy would never occur as it had in Europe. In AlGhazalean philosophy, formation of galaxies, planets, abiogenesis, evolution, are all compatible with the concept of God.
It is extremely unfair for Neil deGrasse Tyson to be criticizing AlGhazali as responsible for Islamic thinking's downfall. Think about it, can any one person's philosophy change the course of an empire single handedly? Unlikely. In fact, AlGhazali was deeply criticized and many works were published refuting his work. It was science true and true.
It is true however that Islamic thought did begin its decline after the 11th century (when AlGhazali lived) but Neil should've looked at a more likely reason for this: 1095AD was the first of 7 crusades by the European powers against the Islamic Empire. A country besieged is unlikely to invest heavily in science.

*** Tyson is wrong. AlGhazali was trying to repair the schism between science and religion by bringing both in line. But since his philosophical ideas are anti-Greek, he's been vilified.
If I found out there was a God, I'd like to know what it thought about humans in general. If it had any expectations, was it my responsibility to fulfill them? Did I do a good job? Will I get a chance to improve my record if it even matters? And why didn't it just make our responsibilities more obvious (or at least update them every 1,000 years)? Was the idea of a God being all powerful and omniscient just an unfortunate rumor? 
TL:DR: God would have a lot of explaining to do. 
Actually, the article says "that the definition of 'gateway sexual activity' is akin to the definition of 'sexual contact' according to the state's criminal law [...] kissing and handholding are notably absent from the criminal definition of sexual contact."
**** no it isn't.
Probably not as horrifying as some of the things in this thread, but here it goes:
When I was 12, my father got a job offer about five hours away from my hometown. He went to work pretty much immediately, while my mother and I decided to wait until I was finished with school that year to go live with him.
Fast forward to New Years Eve of that year. We go down to visit my dad, and since he was living with a friend, we decided to get a hotel room that we could all share and be comfortable hanging around there all the time and whatnot. 
Anyways, New Years comes along, we all cheer, watch the ball drop, etc, and then head to bed. 
As I'm laying there, trying to get to sleep, I can hear my parents talking, not a big deal...that was until their talking became moans and their bed starting to creak and move. I was fucking terrified. As a 12 year old, I didn't really know too much about sex at the time, and I didn't know what was wrong with my poor mother. It wasn't until a year later that I finally realized what had been going on.
Needless to say, I've tried to never share a room of any kind with them again.
Shared a hotel room with my parents. Heard them have sex.
I grew out an awesome beard because I was a snowboard instructor. It helps keep you warm while making you look like a total badass. Well I met this really hot foreign exchange student (Spain) in class and decided I should clean up my image. Well before I did that I shaved a sweet mullet and an awesome handlebar mustache. On the bus on the way home from campus a guy who looked exactly like me sat down next to me. He asked me what I was going to school for. I replied that I was going to be an electrical engineer. He told me I should drop out and become a truck driver. I shaved my mustache and cut my hair upon arriving home.
Guy with a mullet and a handlebar mustache told me to drop out and become a truck driver.
When I was 18, I moved from Texas to Iowa.  I was informed by the counselor at my high school (I moved between fall &amp; spring semesters) that I would not have enough credit hours to graduate in the spring, because Texas required so many fewer credits for graduation.
I asked my mom what to do, and she told me I should get my GED right away, "so I wouldn't lose my scholarship".  The scholarship in question was a full ride, tuition+books+room/board for four years to my first choice school.  I did as mom suggested, and dropped out.  Took my GED a few days later, and (big surprise given my 1580 SAT score, etc) aced it.  
A few weeks later, I get a call from the university, informing me that they don't admit GED students under the age of 25, and that both my admission and scholarship had been revoked.  I hadn't applied to any other schools, because my first choice had accepted me when I was still a junior in HS and offered me the scholarship at that time.  
  Listened to mom and dropped out of High School.
Same thing happened to me. My step-dad brought a Quaker Parrot into the new family. For whatever reason it didn't take a liking to me and would dive bomb my head whenever it was let out. After a while I learned to just not go into the family room when she was out. A few years later and I'm older, less afraid of the parrot and she doesn't attack me as much. 
One day I'm enjoying some TV in the family room, she's flying around getting some exercise and decides to land on my stomach. At first I'm caught off guard but I figure we're having some intimate animal-human bonding moment where I'll here a voice and we become best friends. (channeling Lana Cane) NOOOPE. She clamped down right on the top side of my belly button, giving me an instant belly piercing. 
Quaker gave me a belly ring. 
Alright, so I was in 5th grade when I went over to a friend's house after school. When we arrived, his dad had finished installing a new electric fence system for their german shepherd. He brought food out for the dog, and the dog was eating in the garage. His dad then told me to go see if the electric fence was working or not, **while the dog was eating**. I walk into the garage, being the little 5th grader I was. The dog charges at me, biting my arm and knocking me onto the ground. Within the next 30 minutes, I was at the hospital getting a tetanus shot. 
 Friend's dad told me to go into garage that was protected by an electric fence while their dog was eating, and got bitten.
I know of a man - Aime Gratton was his name - who tried this as a defense for killing five women and girls when his truck collided with the vehicle they were riding in. If I recall correctly, he was sentenced to eight years in prison but charges of impaired driving were dropped (he was convicted of dangerous driving causing death, I think).
So his defense worked. I even watched an expert for the prosecution admit during the preliminary hearing that Gratton could have emptied the liquor bottle found in his vehicle after the crash.
Of course, the strategy worked only because Gratton took off after the crash and wasn't found for several hours, effectively making blood alcohol tests worthless.
 if you take the advice offered to OP, be sure to hide in a grain silo for a while to delay the blood alcohol test from taking place.
My high school guidance counselor actually told me that I wasn't college material and I shouldn't even bother. I told him to his face that he was a stuttering lisp having fucking retard.
I didn't go to college, didn't see the point. 10 Years later and I own a house in one of the most expensive areas of the country, own my car outright and have a kickass job.
- HS guidance counselor told me I would be a loser, worked my ass off as I always do = success
Funny story I had a teacher give me similar advice about carrying around alcohol in your car.
He told us about a time he was driving home from a bar after having a drink or two and got in an accident. When he got in the accident he called a lawyer buddy and asked him what to do since he didn't want the added punishment of a DUI.
The lawyer told him to go into the nearby bar (not sure if the same bar or if accident occurred near a different bar) and to order a double shot of whiskey and give the bartender a $10 tip. 
He told him to do this twice, the reasoning being if he was breathalyzed there would be no way to prove he was drinking before the accident. By giving such a big tip he makes sure the bartender remembers him and can therefore back up the fact that he drank after the accident. If the cops ask why he went for a drink he says his nerves were frayed by the accident.
- I had a teacher give essentially the same advice as OP
"You should break up with him before you see his favorite comedian, that way he can laugh it off"
My sister wanted to break up with the guy she was dating but didn't want to hurt him that badly. Our little brother jokingly suggested that she break up with him before the comedy show they were about to see so he could laugh away his sadness due to the breakup. She took the advice as real advice and did just that. He was miserable and sobbing through his favorite comedian's set and the ride home.
- Comedy doesn't make a breakup less painful
Hot water does cool faster than cold water. If you don't believe it, heat up a pan so when you put a drop of water on it, the drop sizzles away, put the pan in the sink and cover it in water. You'll feel the pan is the temperature of the water. Do the same with a lukewarm pan and it'll still be lukewarm.

[Here's]( another article that says that staying up reinforces/preserves negative feelings towards them...

Well no, it doesn't, technically, lol. What it says is that "...sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories yet recall gloomy memories just fine."
So either way, really, you're fucked. 
EDIT: Well [here's]( a much more legit citation than NYT blogs or therapist interviews. Sleep calms emotions, which supports the idea that you should go to sleep when you're angry to calm yourself down and have an adult conversation in the morning. 
My mom, who was in the psych ward at the time, introduced me to a fellow patient.  "She's not ill anymore, she's about to get discharged as soon as she finds a place to stay.  You should take her to coffee, she thinks you're cute".
Then my Mom invited her to live with us until she got back on her feet.
Then Mom drank.
Then came the intervention. Mom was not well and the girl was insane.  We broke up.  She sucked an amputee's dick the morning before the break up and I will forever be grateful to him for giving me an out.  But he couldn't take her in.  Neither could her parents.  She decided to attempt suicide to get her spot back on the ward.  I fought her for the pills and got my ass kicked (but kept her away from most of the pills, thank God).
 The cops walked on me holding crazy in a full-nelson with pills scattered all over the carpet, with my Mom passed out upstairs and the dog barking like mad.
"You should pretend to come out of the closet as gay, that way you'll have a lot of girls get close to you and you'll easily make friends with girls. After a while when you've found one that you like, pull her aside and tell her that she's just such a beautiful and amazing person that you've fallen for her."
She was *100% serious* when explaining all of this to me.
*** Pretend to be gay to get a girlfriend. 
Was at a family meeting forcibly after I told my parents I wanted to move out. My aunt and grandma told me not to because I was going to end up pregnant, because it is the family curse. A year before, I was told to not to go to a certain college because I was going to end up getting raped and knocked up. I listened to their bs that time, but I was not going to make that same mistake again. I ended up moving out, going to  university, and ended up finishing school last week. I did not get pregnant. My aunt, however, did...
 My family told me not to do certain things that would eventually make me an independent woman because I was going to catch the family curse and get knocked up.
In Japan it is common to find electronic toilets. My sister was at a mall bathroom and we were waiting for her outside. She couldn't read the buttons on the toilet so she just pushed them randomly. One of them was apparently a courtesy flush, it just made a flushing noise and that was all. Another one didn't seem to do anything, but a minute later someone came in and was asking her something in Japanese and she had no idea how to respond. We later found out it was a Call Attendant button.
 don't randomly push buttons on Japanese toilets.
Everyone always told me to wait and lose my virginity to someone who cared about me. The only problem with waiting to lose your virginity with someone who cares about you is that you can still lose it to someone who doesn't care about you, but you think cared about you.
Just fuck everyone 
When I was in college after I had just broken up with my 2 year long distance girlfriend I was pretty fresh to the dating scene.  Fast forward a couple of weeks I'm talking to a cute girl at a house party but she excuses herself to go to the bathroom.  My buddy who fancies himself a stud sees that I'm no longer talking to the cute girl and after I explained what happened and that I figured she was just ditching me, he gives me this piece of great advice.
"Dude if a girl does that you should just wait outside the bathroom for her.  That shows you're persistent, girls love that shit"
Apparently he had read that girls were interested in persistent guys and that's how he interpreted it.
He was also a major creep I found out later, and terrible with girls as soon as he opened his mouth.
 Creepy friend mistakes stalking for persistence.  I didn't get laid
brief background:
Back in high school I was part of the creation of a Peer Mediation team. We went through some training so that we(meaning two of us as partners would go in) would sit down with 2 people involved in disputes to try to work things out before having to go higher(dean, punishment, etc). It was actually really cool. We would hold weekly meetings during lunch and one day after the majority was done, a number of us stayed behind to keep talking but the teacher that 'led' us left. So it was us and the school cop that happened to be there that day(we talked together on mediation's and that week a fight almost broke out during a mediation, so we were going over again how to make sure we know what to do in that situation).
Que the subject of pregnancy somehow being in the after discussion. What I witnessed next was pure insanity. One of the students was talking about how much more their teen sister will probably mature soon because she's going to give birth. This sounded ludicrous especially after her explaining how incredibly immature and irresponsible this sister is(outside of getting pregnant). Cop chimes in, not in the expected way. He went on a diatribe about how good it was for his brother to have fathered a baby as a teen, and how ANYONE that has a child INSTANTLY becomes responsible and mature. The FUCK. It may have been my proximity to a huge number of people with total horrid parents during the previous couple years, but I had to give some excuse to leave immediately because I just wanted to stand up and launch all out war on that opinion. Fuck that pissed me off.
 have a baby when your 14, you'll be responsible and mature because of it!
In my first college class ever, it was a huge lecture 500 kid type class. And the teacher told us if we have any questions, first ask our friends, then ask our TA's, and then if that didn't work, ask the professor. Well I would never go to office hours for my professors because I thought they all wouldn't want to answer any questions. After two years I finally went to my my first professors office hours, and we ended up talking for around two hours about the class, and my college education so far. He actually did care about me. I wish I wouldn't ignored that first professor from the get go.
 First professor in college told the class not to go to office hours unless its super important (it was a huge class), two years later go to office hours and teacher actually enjoys students going to his office hours.
About 3 years ago my second toenail began turning in and becoming ingrown (joys of getting older).  Taking good care of it helped, but it was headed to a bad place, and it constantly hurt when I was on my fee a lot.
Then about a year ago I was goofing around and stubbed it really hard on a table leg and heard a really loud POP.
Thought I had ripped my toe off....
Turned out I had hit the hardest part of the nail head on and broken it clean across the cuticle, and pulled it up away from my toe.
Sounds aweful..... actually a few weeks later it came off.  Daily pain was completely gone and now it is grown back nice and perfect and no longer ingrown.
 probably the only person to have a horrible stubbed toe that enjoyed it AND it saved me hundreds in copays and doctor trips.
Yeah, trying to do that results in an HTTP 502 error.
After reading up about this company, I feel like they're exacerbating the privacy problems with social networks.  It's good in that it might spark more discussion about how bad privacy is with social networks, but these guys seem like dicks.  I can't even opt out, which requires me to OPT IN in the first place.  What the purple fuck?
**** Klout can get fucked
&gt;"...alternative existence"
Disclaimer: I assumed you were referring to your own 'existence'.
As poetic and fitting as that sounds (I'll be stealing that term from you, btw :p), I find it a little misleading, for the story of KS never depicted YOU in some other - and in ways, unfortunately - false reality. KS tells the tale of Hisao, how he deals with his recently discovered disability, his attempts to fit in his new school environment, per se, and simultaneously endure the throes of love with one of five (awesome) women. As engaging as the story may be, it was never about you (that even makes me sad).
Also, realize in each story there is a fuck load of shit that really doesn't go Hisao's nor his partner's way. I would rather not go in to detail, although one example would be [spoiler](/s "Lilly's departure to Scotland"). You may claim that the love between the two had already been established, and that the travesty above simply detracted from it, but that is besides the point. These "happy" conversations you have with the girls in your class are, in fact, the first of the many stepping stones of which you must traverse to obtain your ultimate goal; love. Perhaps walking along said path with some won't end well or as you imagined (regardless how much you actually like the person), but be happy that the likelihood of [spoiler](/s "one who loves you as much as you love her leaves to another fucking country") is pretty damn low.
I do recognize the fact my logic is convoluted and a little stupid, but I felt from reading your post that you were under the impression these "happy convos" with girls is what takes away, or prohibits, from loving them - or learning to do so - [spoiler](/s "like leaving to fucking Scotland did to Hisao and Lilly"). The only way Hisao got to know, and eventually passionately love each girl in KS was through "happy talks". One's inner beauty is exactly that: inside them and, for some, hard to find. The thing about Hisao's story is that it the intrinsic beauty of some girls sort of fell right under his nose. You're going to have to do a lot more leg work.
Somewhat irrelevant =&gt; Life's a bitch and then you die.
EDIT: Realizing the text above is how I came to terms with the fact all KS will ever be is just a story, and a damn good one at that. 
I don't think rape is funny because its acceptable. It is funny precisely because it is unacceptable. For me, r/WTF is essentially a subsection of r/funny. This also true of most of my close friends, none of whom think rape is acceptable. I cannot explain to you exactly why, although [George Carlin comes close.](  [Sacha Baron Cohen's recent interview]( expresses a similar sentiment. That is, how he finds humor in people or acts that he **simultaneously** finds despicable.
This is not to say that there are some people who laugh at this post because they think that rape is just another form of recreation, but to automatically equate finding humor in this post with supporting rape culture is to make massive unfounded assumptions about a shitload of people. Its ok that you don't think this is funny, but you need to realize that not everybody shares your sense of humor. For example, it would be *unacceptable* to *assume* that someone who laughs at a holocaust joke is a Nazi.

laughing at rape jokes ≠ thinking rape is acceptable
Awww man sorry to heat about that. I'm glad that your dog is ok. It might sound a bit odd, but I wish your dog a happy birthday. I could tell that you really love your dog. It's things like that that give me hope for human kind. My sister had a chi huahua mix dog, yes it barked a lot, but he was one playful and affectionate little fella. Long story short I have really jerk neighbors and a man that was fixing the apartment on top of ours saw someone visiting those same neighbors and since the bottom apartment (ours) had a small yard our dog was playing there. Well the guy that was fixing the aparments saw the same people that visited those dick neighbors break the fence and chase the little guy around into the street. That was the last that we saw of him. He was probably dognapped and I fear worse. We tried to get the authorities involves, but nothing has come of it. All this happened while my sister was at school. and what I really hate is that I was in mexico at the time (still am)  so I couldn't really do anything about it. And what really burns my ass is that my sister heard those same dick-ass neghbors gloat about how the dog wasn't there anymore. We never even did anything to them to provoke this. I'm glad to hear that you care about your dog so much and went through such lengths to find him. Dog is man's best friend. If I had a dog he'd be my absolute best companion.
 I'm glad you care so much about your dog. My sister's got dognapped while she was at school. Dick neighbors glad about it.
It was New Year's Eve, 2007 I believe. My dog had just squeezed his body between the narrow slip of dirt and the fence. Just as he got out of the yard I glanced out of my window to see is he was ready to come back in side. I saw him run into the vast woods behind my house. I ran out after him. I fallowed his trail of dog prints in the very thin layer of snow for as long as I could. I came across a field with now snow and the trail was gone. As I was walking back through the pitch black I heard a very loud yelp from my right. It was my dog Boomer. I ran and ran, the yelps got louder, I was becoming very close. I ran through a muddy swamp. I sunk down to about waste deep. I was stuck. The temperature was around freezing. I managed to grab a branch and pull myself out. My legs were going numb. About 100 yards ahead there was a peninsula,when I got to it I heard one more yelp. It was the loudest. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever heard. I thought Boomer was going to be gone forever. Just then I saw a small figure of an animal lying in a small field (not the same one as earlier). It was Boomer. As I drew near Boomer looked up at me, it was the happiest moment of my life knowing that my dog was ok. I found a way home on dry land and carried Boomer home. I lit a fire and lied him down to get warm. He was covered in blood and dirt. I took a quick shower and got changed. I drew a warm bath for Boomer to get rid of the dirt and blood. All the blood came off. Not his blood. All the dirt came off. It seemed like there was no cuts or broken bones. While I was drying him off he looked up at me. One eye was all red and puffy. I had no idea on what was wrong. First thing in the morning I brought him to the vet. There were puncture wounds on the back side of his eye. It would be impossible to fix. The vet said they could put in a glass eye but it wouldn't look natural. The vet also said that they could just remove the eye and sew up the socket. I deiced it would be better to just let them sew up the socket. Boomer is still as playful and energetic as he was when he was a pup. On June 17 he is turning 11. 

: My dog got his eye punctured and it drained, so the vet sewed up the socket.
On some level it makes sense, but there is a number of problems with this approach:
1. Usually such caps are not clearly advertised, they might be mentioned in some fine print or not mentioned at all. You buy 'unlimited hosting' but get a really limited one.
2. There is no way for a customer to check or control everything; limits might be specified in completely arbitrary, meaningless units so customer simply cannot understand which plan he needs to upgrade to. You don't know whether they just have shitty, overcrowded server or your site is indeed too large for shared hosting.
3. This particular formulation, "20% of total server requests" is very vague and misleading. Is it calculated against maximal server capacity, or just relative to other users of this server? So, if they have unusual low traffic you'll be punished, WTF? Does it take into account that serving small static files is incredible cheap, while dynamic pages can be very resource-hungry?
4. The right way is to throttle requests, i.e. make site loading very slow if it gets too many requests. Ideally it should just deprioritize site, but allow it to consume all spare resources of server.
5. Traffic spikes are usually temporary, i.e. link is mentioned on some high-traffic forum and will be visited a lot for a couple of hours, then going back to normal. Good web hosts take this into account: they have enough capacity to handle traffic spike, but if you don't have constantly high traffic they won't punish you.
&gt; Also, when you sign up for hosting, unless you pay A LOT of money, you will be capped in terms of resources that your site uses.
There is no such thing as hosting without caps at all, but if you purchase, say, VPS, typically you are not limited in terms of how much requests you can serve. You are free to have 100% CPU and memory utilization all the time. (And in this case you can clearly see how much resources were allocated for you.)
Yeah, it costs a lot of money -- like 5 or 10 bucks per month.
I once rented a dedicated physical server for $25/month. Obviously, I could do absolutely anything with it, only network traffic was limited -- 1 TB per month.
tl; dr: Shared hosters generally like to screw their customers.
The difference, for me, is that the concept of a 'god' isn't inherently entwined with something definable, measurable, and provable. A 'god', to me, could basically be anything with a significant power over aspects of this universe that link to creation/destruction, causality and some form of 'fate'. If a human were to create something to give them similar mechanisms, I'd probably argue that they could undertake the definition as well. If a human were to have similar mechanisms that allowed them to do the same on another world, it wouldn't be too much different than what we know has happened here, as far as they're concerned. It's like that old saying that there isn't a functional difference between god and an all-knowing, all-powerful wizard: it's just a semantic that we've attached a far greater meaning to.
Fairies have a less arbitrary definition, although perhaps still a subjective one. The fairy that comes to mind when I think about such things is a small humanoid creature with wings and probably lives in a forest. I have never seen, nor heard about such things existing with accountable evidence, and as such, I have enough reason to disbelieve in the concept. Dragons are similar.
Regarding the whole 'invisible, intangible, omnipresent rhinoceros' thing that some people like to spout as evidence against god/God, I'd say that if you change the properties of something that much, then it's a pretty weak argument for it still fitting the definition of what we know to be a rhinoceros.
Ghosts are a bit trickier, since the definition of a ghost isn't quite so fixed. To some, it's a physical manifestation of the soul of a dead-person while to others, it's some kind of nether-being that enacts its will upon this world in the form of flickering lights and radios that consistently play Frank Sinatra without human intervention. My disbelief in this would probably be more of a choice, seeming as I can't disprove the concept entirely, but it's still a premise that is largely defined as something that exists (through some manner) on this earth. I have never seen the physical manifestation of a dead person to my knowledge, nor have I seen lights flickering supernaturally and Frank Sinatra playing from beyond the grave. As such, due to my own lack of personal experience and hearing of first-hand accounts from reputable sources,  I disbelieve it
'The Matrix' bit, or something comparable to it, is a great question to ask agnostics. My own take on it is basically [Chuang Tzu's famous poem about butterflies.]( I do not know, but for all intents and purposes, I am. (At least, as far as I think I know.)
Edit:  'God' is a loosely defined concept that could be linked to at least a few scenarios. Faeries, dragons etc have a pretty fixed definition to them, and no there's no evidence to prove that such definitions currently exist. Ghosts, and similarly slightly more arbitrary definitions could very well be a matter of personal choice based on experience. A 'The Matrix' scenario is, as far as I know, functionally unprovable but unable to be disproved as well.
I'm so happy for you.  your "too long didnt read"  was a little  (derp)
&gt;SH 1-3 were giants among mediocre games
You have no idea how disappointed I was playing 3 after 2. 3 could have been AMAZING, instead it was just good. I actually preferred SM and Downpour to it. Why? The protagonist was somebody I liked and the story was better. Not to say I disliked Heather but Harry is my favorite SH character (James is great too but an unhinged asshole at that. Your not meant to like him which is what made SH2 great for me)  I really wanted more of Harry in 3 and was sad to see his only appearance is just the body model of James in the chair from SH2.
&gt;Also, "the later games suck" is purely your opinion. Some of us like, and even love them.
Thank you. Always love your posts. 
I don't see all the hate for the new games. Origins was meant to be a larger PS3 game made on the Unreal 3 engine but Konami wanted a portable game made in a short time span. Why do you think most of Team silent left after 3? Konami asked for too much and expected to be delivered too soon. Hell SH 3 was only released a year after 2 that's the type of bullshit that can fuck up a franchise. 
Shattered Memories was a response to the fans that Origins was ''Too like the old games'' The monster design was lacking and the enemies were not threatening at all but the story and  art/sound design won me over at the start. The sound track is amazing.
None of the SH games are perfect by any means (Yes even 2!). After playing Downpour you can't say there not trying!
On about BOM is being made by WayForward. There track record is amazing and there making an Adventure Time game and when they were announced as developer for it people were cheering.  
God this post has gone on for too long.
**Stop expecting every new SH game to be Silent Hill 2. SM tried something new it worked IMHO.**
Apparently you can't compete with the propaganda machine of public school. I can guarantee you that no one who has actually studied this at the University level down voted you.  In fact I would go out on a limb and say that no downvoter even bothered to read the Wikipedia page about it. Instead of reading your comment and then investigating why you might say that, people just got angry that even the smallest element of their worldview was being challenged, in the arena of subjectivity no less. 
tldr - don't write anything on reddit that people don't already agree with or they will shit on your internet points. 
&gt; ‘The Committee To Revise Evolution From Textbooks petition removal of archaeopteryx from 6 textbooks.
I don't see what the big deal is, since Archeopteryx [is no longer considered]( a transition between dinosaurs and modern birds, with some doubting that [birds are even descended from dinosaurs](
&gt; birds are found earlier in the fossil record than the dinosaurs they are supposed to have descended from.  That's a pretty serious problem, and there are other inconsistencies with the bird-from-dinosaur theories.
Stephen J. Gould himself has complained about the inaccurate presentation of horse evolution in texbooks:
&gt; Once ensconced in textbooks, misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent, because, as stated above, textbooks copy from previous texts. (I have written two essays on this lamentable practice: one on the amusingly perennial description of the eohippus, or “dawn horse,” as the size of a fox terrier, even though most authors, including yours truly, have no idea of the dimensions or appearance of this breed)
As well as the paleontologist David Raup:
&gt; some of the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information—what appeared to be a nice, simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic
For whales, you have a [fully aquatic whale]( found at [the beginning]( of the transition sequence.  Unfortunately, you don't find the **real reason** for disagreement until the last paragraph:
&gt; The professor of genomics at Seoul National University Jang Dae-ik said "the problem is that the writers of the science textbooks have neglected the new materials on the theory of evolution over the several decades. It even contains the references to Ernst Haeckel’s recapitulation theory which has been disproven a long time ago.  This kind of lapse in up-to-date knowledge invites such an attack."
** Fix your science, then people will trust it.**
Me and friends parked along side a highway in my hometown so we could walk to the local fair. Everyone did it, law enforcement saw nothing wrong with this. I was 16, new at parking and had parked too close to the white line of the right lane. I help my friend out of the back because the car is a two door and right as we go to shut the door and start walking my sister screams from the other side of the car and my only instinct was to fling out my arms and flatten both me and my friend against my car as a semi drove passed us going about 70 mph in a 45 mph. I would say that it was a two foot difference (maybe less, but for the sake of not exaggerating) between me, my friend and the semi. The moment the semi was roaring passed me was the loudest, most frighteningly horrific moment of my life. But the weirdest part was that all I remember feeling was the complete rush of a what took only two seconds to pass us lasting for what seemed like forever. Had I not flattened us against my car, we probably would have been a tragic story on a small town newspaper.
last minute flattening against a car saved me and a friend from being hit by a semi.
Here are some attempts at answering that [
- about 2.5 acres of forest.
I've never heard of that technique. I always thought you knock them on the "head" and then chop them in half. Or the brutal Chinese method of putting them in the fridge until they stop moving and then ripping the top of their carapace off before butchering them.
 Chinese people have figured out how to skin crabs alive.
The healthcare challenges are much larger than simply insurance and policy. 
If all hospitals performed like the 100 Top Hospitals, expenses would decrease by $5.5 billion. According to the American Hospital Association, 60% of hospitals lose money on Medicare and Medicaid patients.  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements average 12% below the cost of care.  
A 2010 Inspector General's report found that 15,000 Medicare patients DIE each MONTH due to preventable errors.  What does this mean?  It means we can estimate that about 400,000 people / year get sent to the morgue when it was totally avoidable. Not only was grandma killed by accident, but providing inadequate and inefficient care is expensive! Medicare inpatient expenditure equates to $4.4 billion spend on care associated with unnecessary adverse or temporary harm events, which does not include additional costs required for follow-up care.  
At the end of the day, what's up?  If all hospitals reduced their operating costs to be on par with the 10% most efficient hospitals (while maintaining quality care), it would save $73 billion per year.  Nevertheless, most hospitals are not taking the necessary steps to decreases these costs.  It should no longer be acceptable for a hospital to not be actively engaged in improvement or cost saving efforts.  
**More people die from preventable medical errors each month than in 10 years of OEF / OIF. Preventable medical errors are damn expensive.  Let's get working on it.**
El problema con las encuestas independientes es que, por mucho que nos muestren los resultados que quisieramos, no enseñan un muestreo del todo muy acertado de todos los mexicanos
Las de internet por ejemplo, solo las pueden responder aquellos que tienen internet y usualmente son contestadas por aquellos que estan informados del asunto de todo lo que sucede en las redes sociales, la gente con acceso a una computadora es minoria y todavia ver cuanta de la gente que usa internet se ocupa en ver asuntos de politica
Las independientes lo que hacen segun se es preguntar en la calle a las personas, como [esta]( donde encuestan en plazas concurridas de diferentes estados del pais (como el zocalo en el caso del D.F.) en estos casos no esta bien representada parte de la poblacion que por ejemplo no tiene tiempo para pasearse en alguna plaza porque trabaja, los que viven a las afueras de la ciudad o los que traen carro y prefieren ir a otro tipo de lugares. O sea, gente en distintas capas de niveles socio-economicos, que difieren en educacion y en lo que ocurre en el pais. Mucha gente que se les va, por decir un ejemplo, es la gente que desafortunadamente es ignorante de asuntos de politica y termina siendo acarreada por EPN, y es lamentable porque como ocupan la mayor parte de su tiempo trabajando para muy apenas poder sostener a su familia no tienen tiempo o a veces interes en informarse bien. 
Entonces el rollo es, buscar una encuesta que haga sondeos de forma aleatoria en las diferentes entidades del pais, en los diferentes niveles socio-economico, que corrijanme si estoy equivocado, pero entiendo que esa es la metodologia que usan las encuestas oficiales/mainstream/etc
**edit y ** tendriamos que ver que metodo usan las encuestas independientes porque las que al menos yo conozco, no usan metodos acercados a la precision como los metodos que usan las principales encuestas (que les paguen un dinerito para despues maquillar los resultados es otro rollo)
I met Steve Nash when I was a child. When he moved to Dallas he coached my step-mom's soccer team in the off season. Nash was actually such a good soccer player he could have played professionally. He was dating one of the girls on the team and coached until the basketball season started. He still showed up to a couple of games and signed my the cast I had on my broken leg. He always had a younger kid with him who didn't have a family that he hung out with and was a mentor for. For that reason alone I have and always will be a Steve Nash fan. Great player. Better man.
 Met Steve Nash through step mom's soccer team. He's a good person. 
I met Kobe Bryant at a restaurant once - we'd accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that).
Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says "I'm so sorry, but we'd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we'll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you'd like while you're in town." My wife and cousin were both like "Yeah that's cool." and I kind of played the asshole a bit.
"I'm sorry, I just don't understand. We've been here for 15 minutes - we've just ordered. Can't we finish our meal here?"
Then out of nowhere Kobe Bryant shows up next to the manager and says "Paul, these guys can finish. We'll be at the bar. I got some time."
And I (being a big Kobe Bryant fan) said "Oh wow, uh... I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table."
Kobe Bryant was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Kobe Bryant and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.

**TLDR I made sweet man love with Kobe Bryant**

EDIT: Yeah I didn't write this story, the original is with Peyton manning. Just clarifying because it seems people are upset about it
I was eating Breakfast the day after the Thunder beat the Mavericks in game 4 this year at a restaurant named Mimi's Cafe. As we were looking at our menus I look up and I see James Harden out of the corner of my eye. My mouth just dropped and I pointed at him. If you recall this was the day after he dropped like 26 or so on the Mavs. My parents were trying to figure out what was going on and then they realized it. About that time James looks over at me. What was my reaction? I waved. He didn't wave back. I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm special. It was easily the least cool thing I've ever done in my entire life. 
James Harden probably thinks I'm the biggest creeper in the world.
Was at south beach, ordering chicken wings  saw dwade walk by asked him for an autograph, he looked at me and saw "Naw man not today" oh okay whatever I thought. Walking a block ahead I see dwade cheesing big time with 4 chicks.
dwade is a dooshbag...unless u have tits
Walking through Times Square and notice a big dude ahead of me. I get closer, and I realize: holy shit this guy is HUGE. I get closer and realize HOLY SHIT ITS MARC GASOL. I don't meet a whole lot of NBA players, so we cross paths and I end up just staring at him as we walk by, like this is a commercial for shampoo or something. Ten seconds later I realize this is my only shot to say something, so I turn around and yell "MARC GASOL!" So I may have failed to actually talk to Gasol, but I did draw the attention of everyone in Times Sqare. TLDR I'm a douche.
My best friend got me club level tickets for the Rising Star Challenge as my birthday/Christmas/Valentine's Day present. At halftime, I went to go get a drink and popcorn, and since I'd never been on the club level before, I was kind of wandering around looking for a concession stand. I saw Marc Gasol. We made eye contact for a solid three seconds. He kinda looked like he was in a hurry so I didn't ask for an autograph or a picture. After the game we saw Marcus Morris signing autographs for kids and taking pictures with people. When we found the elevator, the guy who got on in front of us just happened to be Dikembe Mutombo (the elevator was crowded so we waited). There were two really drunk guys who kept yelling, "YEAH! MUTOMBO!" and he just smiled and waved.
I met Dwight Howard autograph signing last year. He looked exhausted, and had a black eye from the game the night before (against OKC, I believe). He was taller sitting down than I was standing up.
**tldr**; I didn't *technically* meet anyone at Rising Stars. Also, Dwight Howard is very tall.
Buried but this is a good story involving **meeting CP3 and Jay Bilas bricking a free throw** so what the hell.
***I got to hang out with Chris Paul on my 12th Birthday while he was still at Wake Forest.***
**Backstory -** It was 2003, right before Paul's rookie year, and I was at Wake's basketball camps all summer. This one was a father-son deal over my birthday and my Dad ends up telling Skip Prosser (Wake's Coach) it was my birthday. 
**Later in the day** - After the daily wind sprints, Skip looks around and calls up [Jay Bilas]( who was there with his son. He tells him if he makes this free throw, we don't have to run anymore. **Jay bricks it.**
He then looks into the crowd and starts calling out my name. I'm thinking "*Oh shit, I'm gonna have to take a free throw in front of all these people*", but Skip brings me up and says that if everyone sings happy birthday to me as loud as they can we don't have to run anymore. Kids were literally screaming the song. All the players thought this was hilarious. **Chris stuck out to me because he made a point to come over and tell me happy birthday after everyone else had left.**
**The good bit:** After this, all the players on the team (Chris is the only one still in the NBA) started giving me special treatment. I got photos with everyone, CP signed everything I shoved at him, and I worked with him on my ball-handling. I remember he was dribbling two basketballs back and forth between his legs like it was nothing while he was giving us instructions for the next drill. 
He was a really nice guy, and pretty short, I think he is right about 6'0. But even before he went to the NBA his ball handling was mesmerizing.
**- CP3 sang Happy Birthday to me**
I live in Minnesota but was on a family vacation with the family in Cali. We were eating outside at a subway in Malibu and I couldn't help but think this guy at a restaurant next to us looked like Kevin Garnett. This was his post-minny era but I still thought it would make good conversation to say I was from there and a big fan. I never got that far. As we were about to leave I go up to the fence of the patio he was eating on and ask if he is KG. He gives me a "yeah" with the heaviest accompanied sigh he could muster. Then the waiter tells me to leave so he and his wife (maybe gf, idk) could eat in peace. I can understand why me intruding on his lunch would be annoying but it was still a little disappointing. 
 heard Kevin Garnett is a douche, confirmed it.
Haha! Thanks. My boys and I have an awesome relationship; the perfect blend of playful and respectful. I am only 34, but I try to stay young by getting involved in the things that they like. This way I can see what they see and offer advice from their perspective. 
Thanks for the compliment, I love being a Dad!
While I agree with the central point of this article, it would help the author's point if he was more focused.  It doesn't serve the central argument to tack on a blurb about the GOP attack on climate science near the end of a discussion about a GOP attack on gathering demographics data.  I understand the parallel the author was trying to draw, but out of place bits like this make it easier for the not-yet-swayed to throw the whole argument out on the basis of political and personal belief. 
- Focused ideas have fewer edges at which to tear.
Ok looking at the facts here:
**Based on the dog:**
Well Fed, No signs of famine, coat shiny. The dog doesn't display any signs of rabies or such. Not to say that the dog doesn't have any illness it just can't be seen.
Stance is retracted almost cowering/submission. Ears folded down, doesn't display an offensive stance. This is possibly due to the WTF amount of pepper in his eyes though.
**The Police:**
Highly casual, the officer in question doesn't even change the direction or stop to face the dog whilst using the spray. None of the officers look like the are in any sort of imminent danger due to lack of concern. No display of fear or heightened emotion.
Would like to know why two officers have their pepper spray out, without more context it's hard to determine. It would only take a very small shot of spray to deter the dog, no need for two cans to be brandished. Anymore would be considered inhumane.
For two police officers to be carrying pepper spray out at the same time with no immediate threat is highly unethical and could warrant some form of punishment. Two police officers should not be brandishing any sort of weapon as such whilst there isn't any threat to themselves or others. Weapons are always a last resort, regardless of the situation.
Officer in the front looks as if he is distracted by something in his hands. Regardless of what the man is distracted by, if the dog had shown any form of aggression (barking, growling) or posed any sort of threat it's human instinct to identify your threat and it's threat level. Even so if his partner had required to resort to pepper spray to defend himself the other police officer should be well aware of the situation.
**** I'd say the officer has given the dog a quick one shot as a deterrent. Dog's are unpredictable and often it's hard to judge their hostility. The only thing that worries me is why the officer at the back felt the need to brandish his spray at the same time whilst it's obvious the one in the middle warrants no sign of distress. Either he is scared or he needs to be re-evaluated psychologically.
 
Oh no.  Not this.  This is the same stuff that gets drug out at the festivals every single year.  It's that attitude of "If you don't have a copy of "Nun Slaughter 4" then you aren't a fan and you shouldn't be here". Yes, there are some people whose taste is questionable on this sub.  There also will be people whose taste is questionable if you find the magical land of Horrorshire.  It's just the way people work.  Some folks are going to have different opinions than yours.  That's not a bad thing, it's just a thing.  
I'm in my 30's and lived though what you consider the golden age of horror.  There was some great stuff.  There was also some terrible stuff...just like modern horror.  Just because it is older and came at a time of awakening for the genre doesn't automatically make it better.  
I've been going to Fantastic Fest for the last few years and there is some really tip top stuff being made today, granted, a lot of it doesn't get any kind of mainstream attention, but it's out there.  Just because it is modern, doesn't automatically make it bad (House of the Devil for example and I thought...although nobody else here seemed to think so...that West's followup The Innkeepers was pretty great too...for different reasons though).
You also have to keep in mind that Reddit, being on the internet, is worldwide.  As a result you're going to have people on here who don't have easy access to, or awareness of, all of the great horror movies of the past and present.  The kid growing up in rural Nebraska whose only resource is First Lutheran Video Rental isn't going to be as informed, but by getting some of the more accessible things, they are heading down the path.  Instead of just dismissing someone as dumb for liking Paranormal Activity explain to them why it's easy, forgettable fluff and then suggest to them an alternative along the same lines that actually has some merit (unless that movie happens to be Thankskilling...if someone likes that movie, they simply don't understand the genre and you need to back away from that person while trying not to provoke them as they are more than likely a dumb animal in a human costume...I kid, I kid...kind of).
Remember, Reddit is user generated, so if we are able to spread the word and teach these folks to fish instead of giving them fish, then feasibly the quality of the sub will improve.  Leaving it will just put you somewhere that has even less posted than is already posted here and more than likely that community will suffer similar issues, just along a different spectrum, since it will also be populated with people who happen to have opinions.  Exodus will also simply aid in further weakening this sub.  It's lose-lose.
 Think not what /r/horror can do for you, but what you can do for /r/horror.
That's basically my viewpoint these days. Most of these atheists on reddit are just as bad in my opinion and my best friend is a diehard christian. The reason I left the faith was more of a personal reason. The thought of sinning being impossible to avoid while everybody/god judges you just puts a ton of weight on my shoulders while most Christians insist that the faith is supposed to be a relief/privilege.
Furthermore, the fact is the the bible was written by human hands and the new testament is basically a revision written by a bunch church officials. I can't deny that the bible teaches some great practices, and I can't deny that many of those church officials who wrote the new testament completely believed and sought after a better society, but it disagrees with me fundamentally. When I was a christian I tried to create this "connection" with god for years. I'm a skeptic by nature and I was keeping my eye wide open for any evidence that there was anything there while being careful not to fabricate anything just because I was desperate.
Those were years and years of failure. I sang loudly, I cried in desperate attempt, I held my hands up, I joined church groups, and I looked for help from various wonderful religious people in my life (pastors, relatives.)
The fact is for my entire life everybody told me that all I had to do was believe and open my heart for jesus and I would have a relationship with god, but the fact is that I was committed, hard working, and passionate for years and every minute of the way I never got a single shred of evidence that I had achieved some sort of spiritual connection. I kept asking myself why It was impossible for me while every-day all around me people were "saved" and talking in tongue and feeling the power of jesus when I was apparently excommunicated.

So, Long story short, I finally gave up and tried a different view that did not drive me into self hatred. I tried a view that has more solid evidence and things I can understand step-by-step. As a general rule I think most Christians have just convinced themselves that certain feelings are actually from god, but I still have the same feelings I just call them different things and I think they're caused by by different things.

The truth is that the world is not really a nice place and Christianity/religion can be a great masking/coping system for many. The only real reason I get upset with Christians is because I have achieved a mostly non prejudice way of viewing people of different races/religions and most of the time I'm thrown out for treating Muslims equal to Christians. (mainly because of my location in the world [bible belt])

The Reason I am agnostic and my views on religion.
I retain faith in the cast and remaining writers that it won't be a horrible travesty.  I try to remind myself of that, anyway.
The number of shows that reach a broad audience *and* are really good is exceptionally low in the scheme of things.  Maybe Community has the potential to be one of those exceptions, although again, the fact that they're moving it to Fridays pretty much guarantees its demise after the next season anyway, so I don't really see the point in claiming they're trying to broaden the audience.  One point of note as I see it is that, as most seem to realize, Community is embraced by internet-savvy people who are watching online more than on TV, so to them the day of the week doesn't matter so much.  Despite that though, many of those people are the ones who are already watching (and, much like with Arrested Development, interest is constantly spreading via the internet), so what does it mean to reach a broader, more profitable audience by putting it in a crappy timeslot when nobody is watching TV?  They seem to be paddling in two different directions.  However, I'm just some dude who watches shows; I'm sure the people more intimately involved see something I don't.
As far as Harmon's involvement, Community has been a show where every episode was exciting because they were all so different and fully and individually realized and you never knew what you were going to get, and it's pretty apparent that was mainly due to Harmon's vision.  Unfortunately, this is exactly the kind of thing a broad audience generally doesn't seem to like when you look at the sitcoms that *are* successful, so it seems pretty clear that from now on it will not be the show that we all grew to love for the reasons we grew to love it.  I suppose we shouldn't hope for the same magic it has had for the last three years, but maybe we can hope for it to at least stay true to the core dynamics of the show as far as the group goes, and that might be reason enough to keep watching.
Any time I think about the way Community has been struggling I'm reminded of Scrubs, which managed to live for nine seasons (sure, maybe eight, depending on how you look at it, but I still loved season 9), and I've always thought it had a very similar spirit.  But I think what kept Scrubs alive was its firmer grounding in a recognizable and familiar context, something that Community doesn't necessarily adhere to.  I think that's why Community struggles to find an audience, and at the same time, it's why I love it even more than I loved Scrubs.  So my prediction is that the new Community will focus more on a core group of friends and their experiences at a community college and less about completely outlandish parodies and experimental formats which have nothing to do with college or reality.  I just hope they don't try to turn it into TBBT, turning the study room into Leonard's apartment, hammering away at boring, obvious love interests, and constantly mocking the dorkiness of the characters.  (Sorry TBBT fans, I really don't mean to hate.)
 Half-drunken rambling about Community, resulting in nothing.
I'm the OP's girlfriend, and I'm really annoyed that anyone thinks this is a marketing ploy. This is an honest and true account of our experience with this toy. The reason he gave links for the toy and the lube were just so that we could give other people our recommendation. 
Both of us are frequent commenters on /r/sex. Obviously, "Madison" is an alias (and this username is therefore a throwaway), but you can see from my other account- sexinthepark -that this is true. 
r/sex is a place to write about personal experiences and share them with others. My boyfriend did a spectacular job conveying the intensity of our experience with this toy, and you are discrediting his writing because it is *good* and because he gave links to the products we used. 
**TL:DR** I am the OP's girlfriend, and this is *not* a plug (no pun intended) for Aneros, he just wanted to share our experience with it. 
The problem with listening to "people on the internet" is that they don't actually know what they want. And they sure as hell don't actually want it hard.
Players today don't know what they want - they just know they're bored with WoW and its clones. Which is why there are so many "WoW-killers" that don't really go anywhere. They might get off the ground and into the green, but they don't skyrocket. 
Ultimately I believe what players want is a feeling of accomplishment after an hour of play, WoW was very, very good at this. You logged on, you ran a couple of quests or a dungeon and you got a level or a piece of gear for it - it's only when they tried to exploit that mechanic via the daily system that people slowly began to realize they were being taken for a ride on the Psychological Exploitation Pony™, being given the feeling of reward, without an actual reward (Tokens.)
The problem with the kind of game you're looking for is that it would require its playerbase to have patience, something gamers aren't known for in the slightest. In order to get that feeling of reward they would need to invest days, weeks and months to see anything, rather than an hour or two. EVE works very much like this, you can log on for a few hours in a day and make a few million ISK (EVE's Currency,) and you don't really feel very accomplished, but a month down the road when you've trained enough skills and saved up enough ISK to buy that Battleship you want is where the reward is.
A game that takes that long to deliver a rewarding feeling won't be super popular. EVE has a pretty healthy playerbase, but it's not big, and it's viewed as a non-competitor by the bigger (and more hyped-but-ultimately-failure) titles.
 You really have to look at it from a psychological perspective, rather than a mechanical, idea or development one. People play games to get away from real life, where reward takes a lot of hard work and effort, and they don't want their games to function the same way.
I agree with you; particularly with your last point. OP's description of a supposedly 'horizontal' progression exhibits elements as what he describes as 'vertical.'
I'd also like to add that despite arguing otherwise(based on his comparison between the two models of progression) there will effectively still be a divide between start-game and end-game as obviously becoming an individual of fame and prominence in the game he describes, or as it can be compared to, **'leveling up'**, would still require quantifying the amount **x player** has done **y task**, or **'experience'** as most gamers know it. 
We will still see the clear divide between end-game players and otherwise(city governor - city guard.) I'd like to think about it as essentially a medieval era simulator whose problems will inevitably include the aforementioned problems with games possessing the 'vertical' progression concept. Additionally on the development side, mechanics-wise, this will be a very difficult game to create and the period of time it needs to get to the point where the game's efficiency will be substantial to unlock its potential is especially vexing. I'd like to use EVE as an example as it's pretty much the game I'd like to believe OP is describing albeit in a space odyssey setting. You can be a 'guard', a 'brigand', a 'worker', and a 'king.' Anyone who's familiar with EVE's history could attest to that.
As for OP, your game will eventually just cease to feel like a game. I agree with a lot of [SpectralShift's]( ideas in that it will probably become very EVE-like, as otherwise it will suffer population imbalance and consequently economic instability. 
Video games(RPG's in partuclar) have always been a tricky to make and we're still pretty much at that point where logic and algorithms and the capabilities of coding are struggling to keep up with our imaginations. We'll get there eventually but until then, I'll probably stick to pen and paper as my preferred medium for role-playing.
**** I disagree with some of OP's points regarding progression in mmorpgs.
**EDIT:** You have a typo, you say? Take a proofread then see me in the morning.
I am guessing you were not alive in the 1950's.  I was, and something that is easy to misunderstand is the social effect of segregation.  I grew up not knowing even a single black person.  Racism was a very natural feeling when one has never known any black people in that environment.  Only many years later when I got to know and become friends with black people can I say that I have gotten past racism.  
tl'dr  [Governmental policies forcing desegregation]( worked.  
My dog, Honey (an apt name as it describes her coloring and her disposition), is absolutely terrified of thunder due to a near-death trauma she suffered a few years ago.  This was kinda my fault.
The sky was kind of overcast that day, so I let Honey out, thinking she wouldn't want to be out long if it started raining.  A few hours later I had to leave for work.  "No big deal," I thought, "someone will be home in 45 minutes to let her in."
4 hours or so later, at like 7:30, I get a call from my stepmom on my work phone (something she's never done before), frantically asking the last time I'd seen Honey.  She hadn't come home for her supper at 4, which was unheard of for her.  I told her I hadn't seen her since about 11.  When I got home it was after dark, and I joined the rest of my family outside calling for her.  No luck.  This was Thursday.
Friday and Saturday were kind of a blur - when we weren't working, we were searching, printing out signs, calling shelters and asking around the neighborhood.  I must've apologized to my stepmom fifty times.  She told me that it wasn't my fault, anyone else would've done the same thing.  "Yeah, and if you were the one who did it, you'd be on this side of the conversation," I said.
"...Good point."
By Saturday night the guilt was too much and I couldn't be in the house anymore, so I spent the night with some friends.  Sunday morning I got a call from my stepsister saying they found Honey.  I immediately asked if she was dead, and was told no.  "Then where the fuck was she?!"
Apparently she'd gotten herself stuck inside a storm drain, which had then filled with rainwater.  She probably went inside to get away from the thunder, which already made her nervous.  This pop dog was stuck for three days in cold, filthy water.  The only way she kept her head above the surface was by resting her front paws on a ladder, so all of her weight was on her back legs.  Apparently a young couple was walking their own dog and hears Honey crying, so they found her and called the police, who got her out.
As soon as I hear all this I rush home to see her and start crying.  My dad and stepmom lit a fire in the woodstove (this was in July) and she was laying on a blanket in front of it to warm up.  She started crying when she saw me and clearly wanted to get up to get pet, but couldn't manage it.  She tried to give me her wrinkley-nosed doggy smile that looks like she's about to bite you, but all she could do was make her face twitch a bit.  I spent the next hour just loving on her and saying I was sorry.
So yeah.  Ever since then, Honey has been absolutely terrified of thunder.  She needs to have her face tucked into a person she loves, I guess to remind her she's not alone like she was for those three days.  I try to be the one to do it, since I'm basically responsible for giving one of the world's most lovable dogs PTSD.  
 Left dog outside during cloudy day, which turned into storm.  Dog hid in storm drain, got stuck, could have died alone, slowly.  Dog is understandably traumatized.  
Sorry for the long post, I always think of it when I see dogs afraid of thunder.

This is actually bad for the dog.  Because you're cowering with them, they don't have a strong point of reference to take as alpha.  This will cause them to challenge you and cause other behavioral problems later on.
Instead, invest in an anxiety wrap and try to find ways to make a positive experience out of the storm.  If they ever get distracted or non-fearful, praise them tremendously and give them a treat.
- let your dog handle its own fears because comforting it is going to have an adverse result
They'll end up like forced memes usually do: hilarious to the masses, disgusting to the few. Many people will find them hilarious (OMG that can't can't spell, lol how original!) while a small few will say how they've been around since for ever.

 locats as advertising is a terrible idea so it will most probably work, while a small number of people hate them.
I have two.
1. "Don't date that girl."
2. "Don't *marry* that girl!"
(yes, the same girl)

*** - I'm an idiot.
Oh shit girl listen let me tell you kids are a hoot - I'm not trying to tell you you're wrong about having kids just please hear me out on this story.  Why just a couple months ago the local elementary school installed a tetherball court.  Motherfucking tetherball - the sport of champions!  I couldn't resist and I went down there and had a grand old time playing with the kids at recess and there was only minor police interference about me being at their recess game.
It really reminded me of my elementary school days at Butterball Lakewood Pre-Junior High Elementary My Dear Watson School (I promise I'm going somewhere with this).  I was the BOSS at tetherball.  Every single day I was out there dominating game after game like my pet lions dominate my crappy housecats at hunting video games which is a great meataphor.
I spent hours refining my skills and getting better; hell, my dad even installed a sick nasty pole in my backyard so I could practice on my own after school (I was a cool kid.  I also would practice board games against myself before I realized how often I cheated).  
Anyway I remember one horrible day.  I pulled off one of the sickest stops you'd ever see man it was so legit you just had to be there to believe it.  But as I smashed the ball with all the force I could muster the 4th grader, Kevin, I was playing, foolishly moved his face into the way of my rampaging ball and got knocked out.  He collapsed hard onto the ground and I knew I was in some serious trouble.
Mrs. Frumples, the lunch lady/playground supervisor, came charging over.  She scowled at me and ordered me to the principal's office.  I was terrified.  I was a perfect student - I was never in trouble.  But here I was, facing down the door to Mrs. Skeletor's office (despite the racist inference I'm sure you just made, she was a super duper nice lady.  Her parents just thought it would be funny and He-Man and the Captains of America had just started being popular with the children so you know how it is).
Sweat was pouring down my faces as I sat in front of Mrs. Skeletor's desk.  I took a jolly rancher from her stereotypical candy jar, but put it back because I felt guilty.  And it reminded me of something.
She smiled warmly, but critically, at me.  "Do you know why you're here?"
"I hit Kevin..." I mumbled, my head hung low.
"Yes," she began, with a sage-like timbre to her voice, "and you feel pretty bad about Kevin, right?"
I nodded, still refusing to make eye contact.  She continued, "Kevin's going to be okay.  It's only a minor concussion and so he'll be back for Game 7 against the Celtics."  This lifted my spirits, although not by much.
Tears welled up in my eyes as I continually replayed the moment in my mind.  "I'm not crying," I said, "it's just raining."  This was a lie but I think she bought it.
"Wait a second," she said suspiciously, "didn't you use that excuse in another story?"  I got flustered and nodded angrily.  Mrs. Skeletor, a dangerously genre savvy woman, stood up with fright and backed into the corner.
"What's going to happen to me?!"  She screamed, "what horrible twist is going to come dropping out of the sky like a bomb?!"
As I turned me head to ponder the useful suggestion she just gave me, I failed to recognize the commotion happening just outside the office.  I was just about to transcribe a hilarious event involving a wasp bomb which is cool and involves wasps and explosions when He-Man burst through the door.  Due to the unfortunate mix-up back at the Superman and Friends summit, he vaporized the harmless and friendly Mrs. Skeletor.  I thought it was a pretty lame way for her to die, but I am bound by the law to transcribe these events exactly as they happened and am not allowed to embellish to my heart's desire.
I attended her funeral later that month.  It was so sad.  I had this vast gamut of emotions that I had to run through.  Excitement and competitiveness about tetherball, uncertainty and fear when I hit Kevin, remorse and guilt as I sat with Mrs. Skeletor, and extreme sadness as I stood at her funeral.  
Kids are freaking swell and it's really important to at least experience what it's like to be with a kid in every stage of their life.  They don't have to be your kids and you don't have to raise them from birth, but the emotions you experience from being around them will be completely beyond any of the emotions I previously described.  Take how strongly you've felt those emotions before and multiply it by a huge factor (roughly based on the number of kids you have and their gross weight it's a good formula but a work in progress) and that's what kids can do to you, even as an emotionally dead adult like most of us are.
** Kids are a source of incredible emotions far more powerful than anything you've ever felt before in your entire life.  Mrs. Skeletor did the best job raising me those 27 years that I could have possibly asked for.  She was an amazing principal and I owe my scholarly success entirely to her.**
Men can't multitask.....bitch please.
I have never met anyone that can multitask like me, I'll be writing a text paying attention to the tv and talking to someone.
Yet my last gf would go into another world while reading a text and be completely incapable of anything else until she is done reading.
I'm a male who can multitask better than you, just because sex and the city said men can't multitask does not make it so.
Edit** spelling
This is most definitely still a prevalent gender stereotype and a really stupid one. However, in the particular situation you mention, I wonder if the fact that you continually take on these tasks creates a loop of sorts, and people are now asking you to do them not because you're a man, but because they now perceive you as "the person who does X task". 
I'm female and work at a software company, and have become the go-to person for non-technical people on my team to ask for help with OS and hardware problems, in spite of the fact that there are other people who know much more about these topics (as a note, all the other "techie" people on my team are male). It's just because I once volunteered to help with a few of these issues, and people began to see me as the person who solved those sorts of problems.
** It's definitely true that gender roles can cause women to be perceived as less technologically adept, but in this case there might be a benign explanation too.**
Earl has what is takes, he really does. The talent that he's shown at such a young age (shit most of what we've heard he wrote when he was 15, 16).
The most challenging part of most artists careers is the sophomore effort. EARL was obviously impactful and I'm sure Thebe knows this. He understands the immense expectations that are on him and I hope he's not taking it lightly.
He's handling it perfectly, if I do say so myself. His press releases have been few and far between and he's keeping his musical endeavors on the hush hush. Instead of living in the glow of his previous work he's pushing himself, writing, recording, collaborating with a large variety of people that he wouldn't have been able to fuck with without EARL. Basically, he understands that people are listening and he's honing his craft to make his message impactful.
I don't doubt for a minute Earl's potential. I don't doubt his work ethic. I hope he can keep everything together and most importantly, keep his sense of self. He's gotta stay Earl while growing and adapting to his new circumstances.
Sorry I'm lit up right now..
 Earl can do it, and all signals point postively.
I played Mesmer for about 3 hours, and tbh, F2-4 are SO NICHÉ in when to use them. When fighting a boss, usually the debuffs are so minimal compared to the damage, it's pointless, and on normal mobs, you can get 3 images up instantly and burst like 60% of their health instantly, maybe instakill if you stack some weakenesses/buff the damage through traits.
Mesmer *should* be more difficult than it is, because of the lack of actual uses of F2-4. You only use them when soloing a champion monster, or the like. Other than that, they're pointless.
Edit: Grammar
According to 2 devs, Isiah Cartwright and Jon Peters, the necro is the most difficult to master. I will edit and post links once I find them. It will be a few hours since I am at work.


Personally, There has not been enough playable time to be able to say which class has the highest ceiling. If you did not sleep and played every hour possible, you would only have ~60 hours to play, which is not enough to decide upon the difficulty of individual classes. I will say this though, when looking at difficulty level, you need to look at the traits and how difficult getting the right traits to mess together is within each class, along with the mechanic of each class, the skill floor of each class, and what skill ceiling are you judging, If it just overall performance great but a support based build for a guardian is going to be easier than a support based build for a ranger. A glass cannon build will be easier for a thief or ele than for a necro. A control necro is going to be easier to build for than a control mesmer. All of those are just random examples of how different classes are able to do the same thing but they still excel at different things. Comparing the difficulty of a glass cannon thief to a glass cannon necro, the necro wins, not as easy to put together.
 Each class has their strong points, damage, support, control. If you are going to judge a class you need to look at how easy the trait allocation is and how effective each build is. Judging just based upon classes without experience within each class is a joke. Each class has their difficulty and with only ~60 hours of possible playtime, there is no way for us to know.
I'm thinking Mesmer and Engineer will be some of the hardest to master and will have higher skill floors than other classes  (but this could be just that I don't think I have the right thought process to play those classes well).  They feel like they can do a lot of amazing things for the creative person ready to think those things up.  
Well I'll say Ele will be near the top too, but that's because I plan on maining one and I want to feel cool.  I think it will be a challenge to atunement dance well, so that you are always using the cool downs in a timely manner, but I really don't feel it will be that hard to remember all the skills.  You only get one weapon so the ele won't have more skill than most classes do in other mmos.  It might be hard for someone new to mmos, but not for the veterans.  
Everyone keeps saying necros will be really hard just because the devs say so.  Maybe, and only maybe, to master, but I imagine that they won't be too horrible.  Its like when I write short stories, what I write and think I said, isn't always what other people read and think I meant.  
I bet truly good warriors and guardians will be hard to find.  The ones that amaze you and you truly fear.  There will be tons of average ones, ones that just go incrediably tanky or all out dps, but the ones that will be able to fend off 2 or 3 vs 1 and do moderately decent damage will be  a sight to see.  
I bet there will be a lot of good thieves out there, but thats because a lot of devoted pvpers seem to like rogue classes in other mmos and they put in a lot time for practice.  
I don't know... tbh.  But I'll vote engi or Mesmer for hardest to truly master (and not just use one decent build that will certainly be spread all around the internet within a week of release).
I can't thank you enough for your kind words guy and girls. The reason I am on them is because after visiting my dentist I was prescribed codeine painkillers. I used them as prescribed for around two months, had my wisdom teeth out and the prescription stopped. I understood I would feel crappy so just hoped for the best and knew I could do it, I was wrong. I started to self medicate myself with over the counter lower strength tablets contains codeine. They contained 8mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol, taking around 10 at a time to get the same buzz as with the pure codeine tablets. The overdose line for paracetamol would be 20 of these strength tablets, I would do around 50 a day, not good. I started to get an ache in my right side, just under my ribs. I had an ultrasound and it confirmed my worst fear, my liver was feeling the pain and had started to swell. After the appointment for the ultrasound I jumped on my motorcycle (ninja 600) and visited a drop in centre for opiate addiction. I had various tests and counselling session and buprenorphine was decided as the best thing. My councillor informed me that I could purchase something called codein linctus which is a cough suppressant which contains 15mg of codeine in 5ml of syrup, I abused this too, easily downing a full 200ml bottle in a day. I had that for around a month and eventually saw the Doc yesterday and picked up my prescription for Subutex. You allow it to dissolve under your tongue and its one a day for however long you feel you need to start tapering it down. It feels great to be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel and although not fully off opiates, this is by far the best option for me. I would warn anyone not to get hooked on over the counter codeine drugs as it is just not worth it, I have lost years to it and the shame runs deep. Get help and talk to your loved ones as a problem shared....etc. again I would like to say thanks for your kind words, much love through the webs pipes for y'all.
was on drugs, took loads,sought help, life is getting back on track.
Drugs are bad m'kay!
P.s weed is fine ;)
I'm going to give an honest opinion here and say that while it is good that you have recognized your problem and are taking steps to move yourself away from your opiate addiction, using an opiate to come off opiates is counterintuitive for good reason. Continual stimulation of your opioid receptors by any opiates, whether natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic will maintain the downregulation of said receptors. It is this receptor conditioning that leads to the physical and mental symptoms of withdrawal when opiate use is discontinued. When anyone resolves to fight back against their opiate addiction this is an undeniably good thing, but in my experience it should be accompanied with an understanding that they're going to have to be okay with not feeling okay for some time, and understanding that there is no miracle drug that will make the transition to sobriety a walk in the park. Methadone, buprenorphine or any other synthetic opiates used in opioid dependency treatment lengthen the quitting process, in many cases creating a new dependency (sometimes indefinite) to the now-prescribed, more powerful (higher binding affinity) synthetic "cures" to the original addiction. I contend that it is in the best interest of the physically addicted to use the support of family and friends to discontinue any opiates, endure the short-lived physical withdrawal, and through the process of the long-lived mental withdrawal develop the psychological fortitude to stay off of opiates in the future. The relapse rate is high for those who pursue treatment for their dependency, and when (if) the day comes that they decide to taper off and stop, they will still be left to deal with the inevitable withdrawal. With you having been addicted to codeine your withdrawals would be relatively mild and manageable for anyone with a strong inclination to be free of their addiction.
Opiate addiction can be overcome without the use of opiate-based medications, and this is arguably preferable for developing a lifelong plan of abstinence. 
This should either be [spotted] or have a story/more info posted. Please indulge the latter as you're too late for the former.  
- Give me context.
Seems the Romans had already constructed the [Afsluitdijk]( and reclaimed [Flevoland]( in what is now called The Netherlands back then &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
It always bothers me when these so-called ancient maps don't accurately display the correct historical geography. [This]( would be how The Netherlands looked during Roman times.
**TL/DR; Geography of The Netherlands is not historically accurate.**
I'm glad we could clear that up.
I'm sure NASA has people working for them who have evaluated many scenarios and determined that paper binders as an alternate source of information are useful.
Or are you claiming that NASA doesn't hire top-level experts?
 People at NASA who actually do have experience have decided they are necessary.
Yeah, as a guy I accidentally did this to a female once.  I wasn't intending to hurt her or anything, and I stopped myself before anything happened.  I had just got out of a relationship, and a girl I had feelings for before that relationship moved back into town from out of state.  We went and got coffee, and just being my honest self basically told her that I wasn't available emotionally.  I didn't ask her for sex, but I did invite her over and I did plan on trying to make a move.  But I stopped myself because I did really care about this person, and I truly wasn't available emotionally and I couldn't use her as a rebound, I didn't want to hurt her or ruin our friendship so I told her I couldn't see her until I got my shit together.  Then she got married and had a kid lol
this guy might really care about you, but give it a year or two for him to get over it before going on a date or sleeping with him imo
&gt;Just anything or everything interesting you've gone through or seen while travelling.
Lol that is extremely hard to do because there's so much I did the past 4 months that I don't even know where to begin. But here are some highlights that I saw/did
- Cycled down the world's most dangerous road in La Paz, Bolivia
- Did a pampas tour through the amazon jungle in Bolivia and saw a lot of wildlife
- Hitchhiked my way up the Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) in Chile Patagonia
- Trekked through the amazon jungle 
- Saw glaciers and trekked through Argentina Patagonia
- San Pedro
- Learned the tango in Buenos Aires
- white water rafted
- met a ton of interesting people and went on some crazy adventures with people from around the world
That's the version of it. [Here's my public facebook album collection if you want to see more, I organized all my pictures so you can see one city at a time](
I'm about to do the 5 day 4 night trek to machu picchu tomorrow as well!
I have two. 
In grades 7 and 8 I was bullied really heavily which lead me towards suicidal thoughts and feelings, staying home "sick" from school because I couldn't handle the bullying or the fact that nobody (no teachers, other students) were doing anything about it, despite it being obvious in classrooms and during lunch breaks. One night I had decided I had enough and wrote a note and everything and took some sleeping pills of my mom's. Thank God that I didn't take enough to even make me sick and I just fell asleep. The next day I was very *very* upset that I hadn't succeeded, but my parents had found the note I left on my desk and immediately got me help and I transferred schools.
My second:
This was in the 12th grade, I was in a relationship that had started out great and I had fallen in love and all that. After a few months my boyfriend of the time had started to get controlling, saying I wasn't to hang out with certain people (some of which had helped me after my attempted suicide) because he "didn't trust them" and so on, and I was naive and in love so I listened, and gradually it go to the point where I had to be texting him every waking moment, doing things I wasn't comfortable with and having sex when I didn't want to. I was in this controlling and emotionally abusive relationship for almost a year when I walked away from it. 
After both these events (with varying degrees of time after them) I felt *much* better about my life and they helped me grow and mature as a person, and I learned that even when things feel hopeless they get better.
**** A failed suicide attempt. Walked away from an abusive relationship.
I was not, by any means, a skinny child. I mean, I wasn't orca fat, but I was, what my mom sweetly dubbed "big boned." Careful folks, apparently a lack of exercise plus an abundance of food that was either deep fried, covered in cheese or filled with a creme of some kind can lead to gigantism. And not the good kind. 
But I digress. Though not the athletic type, I did play little league for a number of years. I remember I was in the Peanut league (sometimes referred to as "Coach Pitch") where the coaches, well, they pitched. I remember it like it was yesterday. The coach tossed the ball underhand (not cause I was the fat kid. Oh, I was, don't get me wrong. But they had to pitch that way to all the kids). So, anyway, the ball is coming towards me. Assuming I was going to strike out, like I usually did, I swung. And hit it. Very very far. I kind of stood there, shocked, while everyone around was screaming at me to run. 
I'm not sure when it actually clicked, that I had hit my first (and, to date, only) home run (well, baseball home run). Probably as I was coming around third. I know, you're all wondering, did I slide into home? Of course not, because god forbid I do anything with grace. I tripped over it. Fell down, half due to the tripping, half due to the fact that that was, quite possibly, even up until now, the most I had run in one successive sprint ever. (2012 edit: This is no longer true. I have since run two 1/2 marathons and a 5k.)
I have no idea if my team won the game or not. And I'm relatively sure I struck out during my next at bat, or was thrown out at first, as tended to happen as well. Seems I've always had issues getting to first base.
Anyway, I look back at that moment as my one shining sports accomplishment, my own little Babe Ruth moment, and smile.
- I got a home run when I was a fat kid. 
Every time my 3 month old has smiled at me

Edit: Actually there are many more as well..
- A summer day I was a child comes to mind. I woke up early, put on a summer dress, walked out the kitchen door, felt the sun on my neck and the warm grass under my feet and went to check if there were any new bugs in my bug trap. I still remember the feeling of peace and joy and freedom I felt that day.
- When my mother baked a separate birthday cake for me that I got to eat all by myself! (slightly smaller than a regular cake, but it still took me a few days to finish it!
- The times my grandmother helped me sew Halloween costumes
- When I let a girl go in front of me in a line for a gift from Santa at my ballet schools Christmas party and my gift ended up being much better than hers. (the parents had all given a gift each before hand for santa to hand out, and I had helped my mom pick it... a big bag of all my favourite sweets, and that was the gift I got, the last one in Santas bag! The best part was that it taught me a lesson about being kind to others.)
- When I became best friends with a girl in my class who was contemplating suicide. I don't think she would have gone through with it, but I know I made a big difference in her life at that point.
- When my parents received a letter from school offering that I skip a year due to my good grades. (I didn't as I was dancing a lot in my free time so we thought it would be too difficult)
- When I got accepted to the Royal (...) Ballet School
- When one of my teachers there looked me in the eyes and told me she knew I could become a *great* dancer. 
- When my first niece was born and I got to hold her and she fell asleep in my arms
- When I, in my final year at the ballet school decided to give up my life long dream of becoming a dancer. I had been struggling with the decision for months, when I finally made up my mind a lot of pieces fell into place.
- When I met my husband for the first time after having talked with him daily online and on skype for more than 3 months
- When I saw bookmarks of pages with engagement rings on my husbands computer (while we were dating)
- When we had chinese all you can eat buffet right after getting engaged and we started to plan our wedding and our future
- When I got accepted to a fashion and textile design course, despite not having any formal training
- When my dad lost over 30lbs in 3 months and cut most of his medications in half
- When I got married
-When I had a horrible case of nausea and diarrhea, sitting on the toilet while vomiting in the bathtub, and after vomiting blood we finally went to the hospital. I've never felt that weak and disgusting. but my husband was there with me through it all, holding me and comforting me. I've rarely felt as loved as I did then.
- When I got my first positive pregnancy test
- When my husband and I went to my first ultrasound on our 2 year anniversary and saw our tiny little baby for the first time
- When I felt the first proper, big kick during a lecture at university
- Second ultrasound
- The birth of my beautiful son, natural and drug free. Two special moments were when my husband took my hand to hold it while I was pushing, despite all the warnings he had been given by acquaintances, and the second when he said he could see the head and I tried to look and realised I was in such a position that I could see it too. I felt no pain from that moment until after our baby was born.
- When my husbands name was announced as the winner of student elections for one of the jobs as sabbatical officer at the university we are attending.
Those are some of the top ones until now.. I'm sure I have many more to look forwards to :) 
*** I've had a very good life so far
Wow, so predictable. The 1-2 sports games and the shooter(s). Like my ex girlfriend's little brother's friend. He's twelve and telling me how I have to play real games. I guessed that the only games he has are FIFA, NHL and CoD. Who the fuck was right? Me. 
I played CoD, but not just for the online. I actually played through the campaign unlocking achievements first. I made sure everything was completed. I went to the online. Everyone camps with a noobtube or follows you the entire map until they stab you and then somehow the other team has 10 helicopters. I don't think there was ever a moment when someone actually used a gun. The only fun I had was campaign because the AI is much more intelligent than all the people who did my mom and who apparently can sense that I'm "gay".
I'm saying CoD is a stupid game at all. It's just as strategic as most other games. It's the "gamers" who play it that I have little to no respect for anymore.
So you only played Red/Blue. You really have not experienced the franchise at all. I've seen [a guy beat a team of 6 legendary Pokemon with a Magikarp]( I mean, if you really just think it's just 
&gt; You go get 8 badges then kill the final 4, and level up one or two pokemon. [...] you know what beats what, but you can still beat the game without ever knowing about it.
then you have no idea what you're talking about. You said it yourself
&gt; Multiplayer &gt; Single player I play through the story fast to get use to the game then go online.
So you obviously noticed the differences between the online and campaign. Perks, weapon customization, RPG leveling system, nukes, care packages, helicopters. 
It's the same crap with Pokemon. People rush through the story and get their ideal team of 6 and compete online. Personally, I play most games for the single player value because there are a lot of douches that ruin the online, but there are exceptions. 
Before you go telling people that the games they play are stupid and for children, take a second to consider what you know. You're criticizing a series you haven't played in over 14 years yet you seem to know enough to say it's not complex whatsoever. Just to give you an idea of what you're lacking in knowledge:
* Attacks can be Physical, Special, or non damaging. With that said Pokemon have the Attack and Defense stat which deal with Physical attacks and Special Attack and Special Defense which deal with Special Attacks. The latter is from Generation two (Gold/Silver/Crystal), they split the Special stat from gen 1 into sp. attack and sp. defense.
* Pokemon (as of Gen 2) can hold items. From berries which can heal a certain status problem like Paralysis automatic upon infliction, give them more health when they're low, help with resisting certain attack types, allow them to evolve when traded while holding said item, can help EV for certain stats (EV training is explained later) etc.
* Every Pokemon has a different distribution of Base Stats. Some have higher Base Attack while others have higher Speed, etc.
* Pokemon now have natures (as of Gen 3) which means they have a higher total towards one stat and a lower total towards another stat (some natures are neutral and don't affect stat totals). 
* Since Red/Blue (although I will only explain the mechanics as of Gen 3 because they were changed), you can EV (Effort Value) train a Pokemon so that it gains a total of 252 points / 4 (because it takes 4 of these special points to get a +1 towards a stat) and each stat can only get a total of 100 effort points. You can have a Pikachu with a really high Special attack if you trained it accordingly versus someone else who has a Pikachu with a really high Speed instead. 
* There are also IV points. Some Pokemon can have from 0 - 31 points towards a stat naturally from birth (yes, you can breed Pokemon as of Gen 2. I also realized you probably don't know, but there are 5 generations now). I haven't familiarized myself with this concept yet, but you can chain breed your Pokemon in order to get perfect IVs (31 points) for all their stats.
* Pokemon can get PKRS (Pokerus) as of gen 2 which is a virus that helps Pokemon gain more EV points.
* Also as of Gen 2, Pokemon have a 1/8192 chance of being shiny for example the Red Gyarados above. Also, Pokemon have genders. I forget if genders still affect the stat distribution. I know they do in gen 2.
** Yeah, exactly. I still have to cover quite a few things in the game. Here's one more for an idea. There's a Pokemon named Feebas which can only be found in 6 tiles on a certain route in Gen 3. These tiles change randomly. Also, to evolve it, you need to max out its Beauty stat first (in gen 3 and 4 you can enter your Pokemon in contests and they have Cool, Smart, Cute, Beauty and Tough stats along with their attacks adopting the same types instead of being elemental. Pretty lame, but they appeal to female players I guess).**
**Now go click the link to the Magikarp victory I put further up.**
All these guys are joking of course.  Any rider worth his salt buys a new pack of Biltins every month or so.  Where I live you get made serious fun of if you don't have these.  Don't even consider other bearings when these are an option. 
 sarcasm
I definitely do believe there's such thing as human superiority, since this is the backbone of the whole evolution theory. There's always a certain factor that has a better chance of survival within its environment, which could be intelligence, muscle strength, agility, etc., depending on that certain environment.
However, that doesn't mean one should purposely treat others in a negative fashion because they seem not to have specific outshining factors. There is a biological reason not to do this for humans. Mistreating your own superiority leads to a decrease of social status on which humans greatly depend, without significantly increasing most other factors. Mistreating others is psychologically experienced as negative behavior by most humans, making them disallow you to utilize them in a voluntary way.
**** Some individuals may factually be superior to others, but being an asshole about it has no positive result for others as well as the individual itself.
There are plenty of options :D
If you want something ultra portable for at school you can consider the 11" sager which has a 650m 2gb gpu by nvidia. It can play sc2 on ultra which is kinda beast for its size. [Check it out here](
HP has the dv6t and dv7t (15.6" and 17.3" perspectively) but to really get a whallop out of it, it'll be around ~1100-1200 with their 33% off coupon. Personally, they treated me like garbage so I won't ever go there, nor do I ever really feel whole hearted in the recommendation.
Again, I'm not too sure what your needs are to be honest, but [here is a good place to look](
There are plenty of resellers and custom builders, you can kinda figure out who works best for you by contacting them individually. I went with LPC due to them having the best communication to me and well, the best discount too :P
Only thing about a custom builder is they usually only do really expensive builds, just a heads up.
Hope this was helpful!

For me it was an old family friend that almost constantly thanked god for the people she worked with. or for the sun shining. or for the nice rain today. 
The majority of the time it wasn't even my tragedy, but due to the amount of her posts, there was almost always another friend going through genuine sorrow at the time. 
I think in times like this we can equate the feeling to that of jealousy. I know when my cat (of 21 years) died in my arms, I almost wished I could be consoled by a god. I wished I could think "she's in a better place" or "I'll see her again". But I know she's not and I know I won't. At least in my instance she had been in pain for quite a while, so I had that thought to help me. I wish there was something I could say that would help you, but I'm afraid the most I can do is remind you that you have a lot of empathetic readers right now, sharing in your sorrow. 
TL;DR
had friend that spammed god posts, super annoying.
my cat died. super sad. 
wish I could offer you more, but otherwise we're all feeling empathy for you.

I know that, in the America we were all told existed in middle school, we wouldn't have to worry about things like this. But if you know you live in a part of the country where your employers can and very likely will fire you for not holding Christian beliefs, it might be a good idea to, I don't know... not bring atheist literature to work with you? Especially if you're relying on that job to feed your family. I mean, it shouldn't be that way, but it is, and ignoring that's probably not going to work out all that well. Principles won't put food on the table. Fuck it, I'm an atheist, and I've openly pretended to be a Christian in order to get work.
 If you allow your employers to know you're an atheist in the rural Bible belt, you're gonna have a bad time.
It may not be for you personally, but for those who choose to take them in pursuit of of a goal physique or level of strength, it's worth it. 
nb4- "They're unhealthy!" The health risks can be mitigated and minimized with appropriate use. Do some people use them incorrectly. Certainly. Is that the fault of the drug? No. If it were then we should ban most pharmaceuticals. 
nb4- "They're like _____ (meth, cocaine, ect.)" Lol, no they're not. Steroids and the like are used by individuals to bring them closer to a goal, whether performance or aesthetic. They use them because they want to be better at their choice activity. No one starts taking meth with the goal to be a toothless meth-head. Do some people take typical illegal drugs like meth, speed, or cocaine to enhance their performance? Sure, but really that's the exception, not the rule. Most illegal drug users take them for the purpose of getting high; not to be better at something. 
 If you don't like steroids don't take them. If you don't like people who take steroids, stop watching most professional sports. 
Only freeze them if you're planning on double or triple bagging them (vacuum seal them??) and are 100% certain that air cannot ever penetrate the bag they are in. Condensation will not be a good thing in the freezer. This is my previous post on the "freezer misconception":

**TL:DR- "As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely."**
The redditor grunts in frustration and shuts off the flashlight, letting the darkness envelop him and swallow his mass whole. This has been the third time in a row when his nightly expeditions to acquire kittens have proven fruitless and he was getting quite frustrated. He thought about going on one more circle around the neighborhood but it would be getting light soon, his legs were complaining about fighting a losing battle with gravity for so long and he really wanted to avoid having to explain his black spandex to a passerby again.
The redditor turned around and with a sigh of exasperation trudged back to his house. The trek to his room was uneventful--the stairs groaned, as always, but his mother had long since become immune to the noise they made when the redditor went out and subsequently returned from his quasinightly escapades. The ghastly noises the kittens made when taken away from their mother and out of their native habitat could still wake her but for the last two nights, as tonight, her sleep went undisturbed.
The redditor plumped down into his chair (it complained, a bit quieter than the stairs but there has been a notable change in frequency as the chair has grown up along with the reddit's mass) and decided to massage his ego this night by logging into 4chan. 
Using one hand to sip on his week-old big gulp impatiently, the redditor used the other to play absentmindedly with the napkins scattered next to the yellowing keyboard as the computer and subsequently 4chan both prepared themselves for the horrors they would be required to display for the next several hours. The redditor decided to check /b/first for any new camwhores and immediately grinned when he noticed that somebody had actually already posted--and wow! a timestamp! The redditor's hand moved automatically down to his crotch before he remembered the spandex. Grunting in frustration and unwilling to get up from his comfortable seating arrangement, the redditor used what meager strength he had (as well as a convenient plastic package nearby that formerly used to house an action figure that now adorns the top of the computer speakers, a mute witness to all the daily horrors perpetuated in this den) to tear a sufficiently large hole in the fabric to gain access to his member. He clicks 'reply" and scrolls down, his hand gaining a bit more momentum, until.....he notices something weird.
Is that.....? No, can't be. 
.....Is it?
The redditor keeps gently stroking his member but uses the other hand to zoom in on the face. It seemed vaguely familiar. He has definitely seen it before...
he navigates away from his already open reaction pics folder from his previous 4chan visit that afternoon and scrolls absentmindedly through the pictures he has surreptitiously taken during his rare visits into society in daylight. he grins when he remembers the context of each picture--the girl at the library...somebody in her underwear in an apartment...a family picnic...a girl at the arcade...The redditor grins when he remembers all the karma he has gained from these posts all those years ago...
..wait...
..he scrolls back to the arcade picture, studying it intently...that face...it can't be....
he clicks back to the 4chan post, then to his arcade picture, then back to the 4chan post, back to the picture...it can't be but...it IS! HOLY SHIT! IT'S REALLY HER!
His tiny mind awash with all the new possibilities this has presented him, the redditor threw back his head (as much as his almost nonexistent neck allowed) and laughed maniacally into the ceiling.
After a few seconds, he remembered about his mother and cut his celebration short.
His forehead creased with consternation as long-dormant analytical cogs began to turn behind it. He refreshed the page--the girl still seemed to be posting and the timestamps seemed legit.
What was the best way to take advantage of this development...?
 Incest!
the tapered mag leads to one side, that just does not make sense and the 1911's magwell  does not have total clearance all the way to the front of the grip. Note also that the barrel of a 1911 clears the frame of the gun and yet that is not visible. I would not discount the fact that either are fakes, in fact I believe they are.
 you are wrong
 Note I am a 1911 collector

edit: also the grip safety on that 1911 is too shallow to be safe.
edit 2: for anyone not familiar with arms, look at the .45 cartridge next to the 1911 (the gun on the right) there is no way that cartridge would fit in the mag well, not to mention it being inside of a magazine
No, there's no medical background check as far as I know. But, have you ever had a medical screening for a job before? It's by far the most thorough application process that I've ever been through. Unless someone is severely depressed, psychotic, violent, needs medical care that Peace Corps cannot provide, they will pass the medical check. Bipolar people can be in the Peace Corps. If they lie and are found out, however, they can be Administratively Separated. Honestly, it's in every volunteer's best interest to have the most informed medical care possible during PC. I don't see much incentive to lie on the application, unless they are really disturbed, in which case they will not make through training (and maybe not even staging). You will meet some crazy motherfuckers, though.
*** There's most likely no psychological care in your host country, so there will be plenty of crazy people at your site, no matter how many you bring with you from the US.
this is why I use Hulu.
Support that which supports you..
People complain about hulus ads, but I find them infinitely less annoying than any other system.  There is one ad that I keep seeing, 30 seconds of nothing but ocean sounds and ocean views. the 2 seconds of'this relaxation moment brought to you by: blah.'  Its actually really nice.  
Plus I do like the brief moments to pee and think about the show. 
Hulu even supports a desktop app for Linux.  Its very nice.
they cut my charge for the month since I helped bugfix one of the issues.
TL;DR
Hulu supports Linux.  And they seem to be extremely helpful and willing to give perks to those who help them.
I would much rather support hulu than Netflix because of this.
Some battles you can't win.
This might just be one of them
Both Israelis and Palestinians are of semitic origin - both inhabited the land at the time of the bible - the Palestinians converted and were Arabicized while the Jews were not.
Judaism as a monotheistic religion was actually not created until about 600 BC. Archeological evidence paints no evidence of a great invasion and taking the holy land from the Caanites as it is painted in the bible. Rather, it rose among the semi-nomadic bronze age tribes in the Levant, between the Phoenicians in the north and the Monitu in the south (and various Arabic and Amaric tribes to the east).
The region was a crossroads for the Empires of the era - Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans and Arabs, and the tribes of the region rarely ruled themselves, and never formed a grand power like it is hinted that Salomon ruled. It was also a crossroad for trade that the Phoenicians brought in. Any genetic study will be messed up by the fact that there was lots of intermarrying, taking slave wives from the conquered people.
 Palestinians and Jews mostly share a common ancestor, that originated in the regioin. 
Yeah, this. For example: as they lifted the trophy in Soccer Aid yesterday one of the celebrities (don't know who) had exchanged shirts with the losing side. While a nice display of camaraderie at the time it looked a bit daft at the ceremony and will look even worse in the commemorative photos.
TLDR - it's all about consistency.
I think so, here's my reasoning.. 
Two numbers share a divisor if the same number, let's say 4, can go into both numbers. Another way to think about that is that the same number, added to itself a lot, makes the other numbers (so each number would be a bunch of 4s).
So in the case of 12 and 44, they share the devisor of 4; 4*3 and 4*11. 11(4)-3(4)=8(4).  
To think about it algebraically, any two different amounts of x will equal another amount of x.
So in the case above, 11x-3x=8x.  
So to test out of two numbers have a common divisor which you can factor out and cancel out [44/12=4(11)/4(3)=11/3], you can subtract one number from the other one.  
However this is only really useful when you have two numbers that aren't easily factorable in your head, but when you subtract one from another one, you get a number that is.  
Did that help?  
**two numbers with a common divisor will be different amounts of that divisor (x) and any two different amounts of x subtracted from each other will equal another amount of x**
I'll go over this point by point.
First, graphics in ME2 vs. ME3. ME3 wins by a long shot. Not because the engines are better, they're about the same; but ME2 had some mess to it that ME3 did an excellent job cleaning up. There's an annoying heavy weapon you carried on your back in ME2 that was like a permanent backpack on you and was ugly to look at. They got rid of that in ME3 and only revisited it when it was necessary. The overall beauty of the ME universe is very well shown in ME3 with long shots of the landscapes you visited in missions. It looks pretty fucking good. ME2 does this very well as well but ME3 takes it to a whole new level, like a good sequel should.
As for character customization, again, ME3 wins. ME2 was very limited in it's customization. Not so much with armour, but when it came to weapons and skills, there was a distinct set you fell into when you selected your profession. There was a good reason for this however. The original ME1 was crazy with character customization. There was too many options for skills and many were unnecessary and flat, way too many armour pieces, and a shit ton of guns. It was a lot of fun, but come ME2, there was need for change and they cleaned up the whole thing really well, and may have oversimplified things. ME3 found a great balance. It took the simplicity of ME2 and the variety of ME1, merged the two, and made it great.
For combat, it can be more personal for some people, but again I feel ME3 wins. Combat in ME2 can be really slow paced, I remember having engagements last minutes in ME2 while engagements in ME3 last seconds. A slight difference, but ME3's combat engine went away from the RPG elements of ME2's combat, and went deeper into a more shooter based feel. this is bad on easy difficulties, but great on insanity and hardcore mode. You felt good when you beat an enemy with awesome powers and a good aim in ME3, as opposed to having to burrow through chunks of shields/barriers, armour, and finally health on every single enemy in ME2. Combat was basically the same across both games, but ME3 was just paced a little faster. As far as I'm concerned that was a good thing.
Open worlds though, are where ME2 left ME3 completely in the dust. I don't know for sure which one has more explorable space, they're probably about the same. But, ME2 had so much more to do, and so much more you could get out of it. Every thing you did in that world gave you something with a direct result. Getting minerals for upgrades, completing missions to gain team members, then more missions to gain their loyalty, then more missions because "why the fuck not" made the exploration aspect of ME2 the boss. ME3 had none of that. The only bonus stuff you could do gave you war assets, which were useless after a certain point. Things that were explorable in ME3 didn't have much substance to them either. You would literally fly over something, press the A button, and get war assets. That was it. When in ME2 most things actually had missions attached to them, or at the very least you would have to scan over the planet for a while before getting the gratification of more stuff.
TL/DR: Graphics, customization, and combat ME3 wins; ME2 gets the open world. Read up for explanations.
Hope that answers your questions well enough
Facebook ads are not about conversions and selling. The sooner people get past that the sooner they can take advantage of it.
Facebook ads are all about brand awareness, getting your company name / product out and having people discuss it. It is for building a following of people that like and/or believe in your product, pretty much the same thing as building up a mailing list. Once they have 'liked' your page you can advertise your product for free to them via posts and links. They then (if you do it correctly) share these 'ads' with their friends.
Virtually nobody browsing facebook is actively "shopping". They are chatting to friends, catching up etc. If you want to target people with money burning a hole in their pocket use google, google shopping etc.
**stop expecting to sell anything to people who are not shopping. Brand awareness is the name of the game**
Then you've made a terrible mistake. The jump is essentially the prescription that species change in to other species over time. Fish to dog. Dog to Catdog. You're basically thinking of the Pokemon[ Ditto]( which has the power to morph its shape in to any other pokemon.
Consider instead a metaphor using the pokemon Ditto in a way completely contrary to Pokemon's original intention:
Assume for the moment that today's geneticists are generally correct that the genes in all organism point to a common ancestor. That common ancestor is Ditto. But Ditto in this case is unable to morph in to anything. Rather, its fluid, simple form is open to considerable adaptation and mutation, over time, and, most importantly, it divides like crazy. Like bacteria do.
The Ditto population lives in a not-really-but-somewhat homogenous state (more like a bell curve, which is the level of genetic variation usually seen in organism populations). Any sort of significant environmental change could split this population in two, or three, or twelve, etc, distinctly separate populations. If the average genetic variation of a population does not supply the necessary number of adaptive organisms to counteract population losses in this new environment, then it's likely that that population will eventually die off. 
So let's say of the twelve Ditto populations, three survive. Next let's assume that the environments for each surviving population is sufficiently different from the others. That would mean the genetic variation bell curve norm will be different for each population, as each environment shifts the adaptive fringe to the center of the the bell curve. This is what you'd call micro-evolution through natural selection. 
But recall that they divide like crazy, being the bacteria-like organisms they are, and not the mammals that they aren't which produce anywhere from 1 to 15 babies instead of 1000 to 1,000,000 subdivisions within the same time frame. What you get is an amazingly large and exponentially growing bell curve, with incredibly vast genetic variation. Each encounter with new environments continually divide this growing population between adaptive traits that are passed genetically.
When you get a mutation in one of these dittos, the mutated ditto doesn't produce one mutated baby, it produces thousands, if not millions of these new mutations if the mutation is satisfactorily better adapted to its environment. Considering that this remains within the realm of micro-evolution, it is a satisfactory theoretical process supported by observed bacteria cultures. 
But now, don't do this for ten years, or even a hundred thousand years, but instead hundreds of millions of years.
Some ditto populations will eventually develop mutations that allow them to better absorb energy from sunlight, forming the basis for chlorophyll, which will eventually turn these populations greener. These populations will further subdivide and grow their populations wildly, increasing the genetic diversity within their populations, and changing environments will continually separate and shift fringe mutations to the center. These populations will divide to a form a predecessor to moss and fungus. This population will divide in to early types of moss and fungus. These early moss and fungus types will further divide to varying degrees of moss and fungus. The fungus will divide in to fungus that lives in water and fungus that parasitically clings to organisms. And these parasitic fungi will divide in to fungi that attaches to mammals and fungi that attaches to insects.
[And eventually you'll get a fungus that parasitically infests the brains of specific ant species, takes over their nervous system in a pseudo-zombified state, leads them to their impending death to a location suitable for fungal growth, then anchors the now dead ant as a sort of macabre grave-marker for the ants who are next on the list.](
I had too much fun with the last paragraph.
All in all, Macro-evolution does not describe the process from fish to lizard to rat to man. It describes the process of man to less-man-like-man to man-like thing that shares common ancestor with other man-like things (apes, chimpanzees) to things that are much less man-like that shares common ancestors to mammal-like things to common ancestor that shares vertebrates all the way up to the original Ditto population.
 We don't jump to new species. We fall in to them. Or, more accurately, we divide in to them. And not in to species, at first. First we divide in to Domain, Then Phylum, Then Class, then Order, then Family, Genus, Species. Species are the ultimate specializations of very long processes.
Your statement is so full of jingoist nonsense it makes my head spin.  Let's step thru it.
* Armchair pundit.  How is this different from you commenting on this Reddit?  At least he is making a living out of it, while you most likely do something else for a living.  Right?  This is just a pointless attack that means nothing.
* "knows nothing of what it means to be a soldier".  What qualifies you to know what it takes?  Does one have to be a soldier themselves to know this?  If so, that means in order to judge a thing, you must have gone thru it.  So who can judge the death penalty?  Who can judge a murder?  Only other murderers?  This makes no sense.  Of course we can talk about soldiers and our foreign policy without having first hand experience.
* "thinks he can judge the worth".  No.  He's not doing the judging.  You are.  You are applying a word that is fraught with emotion and media fantasies with absolutely NOTHING to base it on besides that fact they had joined the military.  So some asswipe that gets himself killed drunk driving while on leave from a base in Japan is a "hero" to you?  Because that is what you are claiming.
* "people who are dying for the freedoms" What?  Who, exactly, is dying for his freedoms?  Since 9/11, I have seen freedoms taken away left and right.  Also, I was under the impression that our freedoms weren't given to us by the government or the military.  We have them, we were born with them, given by the "creator".
* "that he takes for granted".  I assume you are a mind reader as well, since you know how this guy feels about his freedoms.
*** Stop living inside what you imagine to be other people's minds and read a book.
To the brother:
Dudebro, by the time I entered my freshman year of college i had 6 of 7 girlfriends cheat on me. So head my advice my friend. If someone cheats on their significant other then obviously their heart is not fully into the relationship. Now I know from experience that when it happens it sucks. It seems like there is nobody out there who can be like her and make you happy. But trust me, there is someone. Someone who will be fully committed to you. 
But sadly here is the catch. That special someone doesn't wait around forever. If you stay in this relationship you may end up missing your shot at landing an absolutely amazing girlfriend. A girlfriend who would never cheat on you and that would make you so happy that your ex would quickly pale in comparison. 
Breaking up is tough, trust me. I've been there. A HELL OF A LOT OF TIMES. Yea, it hurts like a bitch at first. Surround yourself with friends and try to get your feet back on solid ground. Take some time to stay single and evaluate what you want and don't want in a relationship. Once you realize this then look to who fits what you want. And go from there however it may be. And honestly sometimes that amazing someone may just fall right into your lap when you're least expecting it. 
Billions of people live on this planet. There is someone out there that is perfect for you. Trust me. Just for fucks sake man, don't let the chance of being truly happy pass you by. 
Because happiness is one this every person is entitled to. 
(Apologies for any gramatical errors and such, after the fourth longneck my fingers don't work as well.)
 Don't let this relationship ruin your chance of being truly happy with someone else.
What I do is just hold it underwater when I get the color I want.  Then after I am done soaking it I pull the stencil off.  Pulling the stencil off takes 30 seconds at least for small stencils.  With the bleach still on the shirt it might bleed into your design if you pull it off then.  
no the stencil stays on when you dunk it underwater.  It is safer to pull it off after you soak it.
&gt;To give someone advice about what food to buy at the grocery store, the North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition says that you need a dietitian license from the government.
This is sensationalist, and you know it. From the NCBDN:
&gt;**It has been reported that that the NCBDN finds talking about diet without a license to be a crime**.
&gt;The Dietetics Practice Act says nothing about “talking about diet.” Standing alone, talking about a diet, advocating a diet or sharing one’s own story regarding a diet is not a violation of the law, nor has the NCBDN ever communicated anything to the contrary.
Also from [the guideline itself](
&gt;**GENERAL NUTRITION INFORMATION**
&gt;Persons who are not licensed to practice dietetics/nutrition in North Carolina can provide general non-medical nutrition information ...
&gt;Under 21 NCAC 17.0402 the Board shall deem an unlicensed person who provides nutrition information or education to be in compliance with G.S. § 90-368(9) when: 
&gt;(1) The person does not hold himself/herself out to be a dietitian or nutritionist or imply orally or in writing or indicate in any way that he/she is a dietitian/nutritionist;
&gt;(2) The person does not provide nutrition care services or nutrition care activities which have not been delegated to him/her by a licensed dietitian/nutritionist;
&gt;(3) The person provides nutrition information on or about food, food materials, or dietary supplements, and does not provide nutrition information on the nutritional needs of the consumer;
&gt;(4) The person provides nutrition information in connection with the marketing and distribution of the food, food materials, dietary supplements or other goods to be provided or sold, and does not provide nutrition information in connection with the marketing and distribution of nutrition services;
&gt;(5) The person provides nonfraudulent nutrition information which is based on scientific reports and studies, is not false or misleading, and is safe; and
&gt;(6) The person provides nutrition information on food, food materials, nutraceuticals, dietary supplements or other goods in accordance with federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including but not limited to G.S. 90, Article 25.
(which is the attitude Steve took, per his site) -- You can talk about nutrition and diet. You *can't* form a practice in which you act as a dietitian and manage people's care as a dietitian would. You can give opinions, write blogs, and offer advice. You can't take on clients, tell them what to eat, and manage their nutrition in a professional way. The fact that his blog is still up, in compliance, and articles are still being written should be proof enough of this, as well.
Also, even if pot smoke *were* acid-forming, and it were a problem, the last thing you would want to do is add **more** acid. That's like saying, "Hey, you know how gasoline catches on fire? The best way to remedy that is by dumping more flammable shit on top of it!"
** False premises and bad logic make for shitty arguments.**
He doesn't scale better than any other ad carry, his damage only scales with CDR while ad carries scale with ad,atkspeed,crit chance and life steal eventually ad carries with the right positioning can duel amost anybody including Urgot, i haven't done the math myself but ad carries have the best scaling in the game and Urgot isnt an ad carry and scales poorly compared to other tanks/offtanks
TL:DR: 6 item carry is a couple times stronger that urgot, don't get me started on Vayne and Tristana
No one else has mentioned this, so I'm going to give the tough love and put it out there. You just admitted to verbally and emotionally abusing him.  It sounds like there is more going on here than simply smoking and drinking.  
I always recommend marriage counselling in these situation. It sounds like you're not very happy with your life and/or the direction it is headed and are trying to fix it. That is great and being sober will probably help this as well. However, you cannot expect him to change over night and you cannot possibly delude yourself enough to think that weed and alcohol are the root source of all of your problems. 
if you were a man and beat the shit out of your wife this would be a very different situation.  You are obviously acting irrationally in many ways and seeking professional help is not a sign of weakness. Hope everything works out for the best.
It actually has nothing to do with the FLAME diagnostic framework. People only drew that conclusion because both the scripting language used, Lua, and that random framework are Brazilian. [FLAME]( - which is an acronym - is a network measurement tool. Tidbits:
* FLAME the tool is Linux-only, Flame the virus is extremely Windows-specific.
* FLAME the tool uses Lua to send network packets for measuring purposes, Flame the virus uses Lua to bind together reconfigurable modules written in C++ or C and compiled down to machine code.
* According to the researchers who made FLAME the tool in Brazil, the code snippets from Flame the virus published by Kaspersky are not from their source code (the source is actually *not* publicly available).
The real story: in the modular system that is the Flame virus, the bootstrap/installation module is called "Flame", so the researchers saw calls to "InstallFlame.dll" and the like.
 It wasn't Kaspersky, it was the virus's developers.
I was watching Star Trek First Contact one day. I think when James Cromwell goes into space and first sees the Enterprise, he exclaims, "SWEET JESUS!" in a comedic way.        
         
A little while later, my sister walked in and relayed some sort of trivial information to me, and I decided to respond to her in the same way. It amused me.         
            
Now, I frequently respond to her in this way. Especially in response to boring stories.         
           
 [This.](
Sir, nowhere in that inane ramble did you make a clear and concise argumentative point. You both agreed and disagreed as to the merits of my evidence to disprove the theory in question, without an actual conclusion. I can understand the spelling and grammatical potholes, but trampling over the decency over a clearcut and concise sentence is a shame to written language. In regards to my mention of several "Bonds", I was simply attempting to differentiate the actors. 
And now I return to my main point of my dissenting opinion, it's a book series. Yes, that's right, James Bond is the creation of author Ian Flemming. From Sean Connery up through Timothy Dalton (that's four switches in casting of the lead character), movies were based on the novels and short stories where the character of Bond was one person. I could further express my points, but I grow weary of this talk.
You sound like an idiot, and the character is from a book where he was only played by one person.
I'm not asking you to sympathize with her. I'm just pointing out that it's not unreasonable to think she regrets not making something for herself instead of becoming dependent on someone else. 
I've been completely independent, with my own job my only source of income to pay all my bills and feed myself (barely, too). I've also been completely *dependent* on someone else. I did nothing while they worked and brought in the paycheck. And to be honest, it's not a good feeling. It's nice not working at first, but in the end you just feel like you're throwing your life away. I actually got very depressed because of it. At least the experience made me appreciate work a whole lot more, so I never feel the need to complain about it. People always think they want to be able to just sit around the house and do nothing all day, but it's really not that great.
 You shouldn't feel bad for her. But you can't assume she doesn't have regrets about her life decisions because it's not as good as it would seem.
yeah rofl no kidding. im old enough now that my mind has a built-in bullshit filter and i skipped that paragraph after the 6th word. I actually went back and read it out of curiosity after your comment. my reaction: "oh good, my bullshit filter is still working!"
 zhanglao is asked to tell us why his major is not worthless and full of hot air- he responds with an overly drawn out paragraph with no actual answer. Unsurprisingly, his response is worthless and full of hot air.

Gameplay wise- I am currently leveling both a gunslinger and operative (scoundrel equivalent), main trees being gunslinger-Sharpshooter, operative-Concealment. The mechanics are VERY different.
As a scoundrel/operative you are pretty much a melee class with a ton of utility. I'd say you have more stuff to monitor during combat as well, looking out for Tactical Advantage procs and ability cooldowns.
Also, stealth will significantly alter your leveling experience (for me anyway) as you can pretty much stealth past all non-essential mobs. Yes you miss out on a chunk of XP but you can always catch up with PVP, FPs, and the bonus series' . 
Gunslingers on the other hand are ranged and relatively stationery, but like others have said the burst damage is the best I've seen so far (I also play a Sorc and Merc).
- yes they are extremely different so go for it, but do make one of them an Imperial Agent because the storyline is amazing. I personally feel the Operative fits the espionage flavour of the IA better.
Ooh, that's a tough one - I would try to avoid having her attend meetings with your mom unless it's absolutely necessary (which is probably how you're already doing this), and 'de-program' her after every meeting she does attend. Also, take her to a Unitarian Universalist 'church' as soon as you get a chance. They have an excellent religious education curriculum for kids that teaches respect for ALL religions, highlights the common themes and parallels between religions, encourages critical thinking, and distills the essential moral lessons (minus the theology and mythology).  As a secular humanist myself, I feel right at home in the UU culture.
My kids have attended plenty of meetings at the Kingdom Hall with their grandmother as well. Age 4 is old enough to begin understanding (a) people have very different beliefs about god, the universe, and everything and (b) there's a time to discuss those beliefs, and a time to quietly respect them without comment.
- Supplement your daughter's JW experience with an alternative religious view - I vote UU! Say lots of good things about respect, tolerance, diversity. She'll get it.
I think they run limited supplies on purpose. I mean every gun they make is sold already so why change. It creates a high demand for them, helping spread the word about their products and also keeps people interested in the company while they make new items. Hell, I found out about the KSG and RMR-30 while trying to find info/availability on a PMR-30 (which I still want). 
tl;dr
I think Kel-Tec produces limited supply as a marketing ploy.
As one of the more opinionated folks on the subject, who isn't rather fond of minecraft, I have to say the distinction has been made rather meaningless.
I've debated with kiwibonga tooth and nail about his engine not being voxelly, textured voxels strikes me as going too far. But I can't describe his shotgun stuff as anything other than a feat of voxel brilliance. Especially that the bones are stronger than the flesh, master work.
The lines are too fuzzy. Besides, the textured voxel folks are using *very* similar data structures to us. The marching cubes folks have been throwing around the word voxel for decades.

As well as, health. Diabeties, Bone density, kidneys, TEETH. No reason IMHO to drink that much sryup. Just start slowing bring it down, honestly after stopping soda syrup you will realize how gross it really is.

I get the feeling you're not really trying to see my point here.
"Luckless games" - tend to get solved and require very complex mechanics to keep a game interesting. The only reason chess is still played is because it's got so many pieces and movement options; this keeps most players from being able to memorize every single situation and its best move. Mistakes are regularly being made, and that's what can decide matches.
However, for games that are on the less complex side or partly based on non-intellectual skill (hand-eye coordination, reaction time, accuracy, multitasking, etc..), a random factor can help keep the game from feeling like playing a checklist. "If A, do B. If C, do D or E, depending on X."
Let's take a real-world exampe, in the shape of the two-player boardgame [Mr Jack]( 
Short synopsis: 8 characters with different abilities on a hex board, one of them is the killer in disguise. It's up to one player (Jack) to protect and hide the killer's identity, the other player (Inspector) tries to eliminate suspects and ultimately catch ("step on") the killer. You do this by moving 4 characters every round and positioning them "visible" (in light or adjacent to other character) or "hidden" - Inspector moves two and Jack moves two. You pick which characters to move from a random draw of 4 character cards. After every four moves, Jack has to reveal whether his killer character is visible or hidden.
Already, there's two mechanisms in place that keep the game varied:
- The killer is picked randomly, so sometimes it's the guy that can move police barricades around, sometimes it's the one that moves 4 spaces instead of 3 and can move through obstacles. This changes the killer's options in trying to escape.
- The random draw of 4 character cards makes it so that you won't always have the same characters available on that turn. Suspect A + Cards BCDE plays quite differently from Suspect A + Cards AFGH. Doing some quick math (which might well be wrong), there are 8*(8*7*6*5) = 13440 distinct game setups possible. That's only the first turn. This random draw is repeated throughout the game, meaning you will never ever play an identical game.
The combination of these two means that it is nearly impossible to memorize how to play this game, and every round comes down to on-the-spot judgement calls: There are too many different openers to feasibly create an "if X then Y" flowchart to play by. The best you can get is general 'themes' and a good feel for the game - skill.
If these mechanisms did not exist, I could win that game 100% of the time just by intently studying one of these flowcharts without ever having played the game: there would be an optimum move for every point of the game, and it would be the same move every match.
This is the reason why so many games feature random chance *as a tool to create gameplay situations*. Note that the above boardgame does not feature any random outcomes at all: every outcome is left up to the player's ability to call their opponent's bluffs, see through their mindgames and smartly position their characters. It has zero "luck" by your definition, but quite a few random factors by mine. It's also about the most competitive 2P boardgame I know.
** If you want to design a game that's fully skillbased and you want to make it accessible - you will need random elements to keep the game from being solved. If not, you will have to make it sufficiently complicated. Complicated is not always good.**
This happened to me, only I was the guy. She was all over me at a party one night and we shared numbers and met up about 2 weeks later.

She was a bitch and stand offish the entire night. Wasn't adding much to the conversation, and just seemed like she wanted me to fail. She said "no" to every plan I offered, and just dragged her to a bar outside near the lake. 
I would've rather had her cancel on me and lie to me than to show up and pull some shit. You're not fooling anyone with a little trick. I ended the night at 10pm, because I became bored as well.

In your jurisdiction, MSFT may reserve the right to assert their patents over anything. They were using this to profit off every device sold in the U.S. which has an implementation of their craptastic FAT filesystem on it.
DotGNU had their last release 5 years ago. At that rate, by the time they hit 1.0 the patents have already expired.
Then there's the practical aspect of it. Who are they going to sue when they want to extract royalties for say, ado, linq and windows.forms? The mono devs would just remove the encumbered bits and MSFT would've gained nothing. Would they sue distributors? Most distributors are bundling it with their Linux distros and they would just drop Mono in a heartbeat. MSFT gains nothing. Would they sue users even though most of them are likely to be customers? Even though some of those customers would have a patent "war chest" of their own? I don't think a legal battle like that has winners, there's nothing to gain. All of those unstandardised namespaces can be replaced with alternatives, end-users don't care. With FAT, there's at least actual end-user benefit of having an implementation of it on a device shipped to the U.S..
 A lot of software is encumbered in the U.S. if you care to dig through the patent office, not just Mono. None of this matters in practise.
This too shall pass, every girlfriENT and wife has those days, and it fucking sucks. I just try to remember that the best days of my life still haven't happened yet - and that gets me through the worst days.

I'm throwing all the stuff at you I wish someone told me at your age.
You have a limited amount of time on this rock, everything you do eats away a little of that time. Right now, it seems like forever, but if you keep thinking that, it'll slip away. Determine what will make you more awesome as a person and do it. It takes time, effort, and dedication, but in the long run, it's worth it. 
Out of shape and want to be fit? Exercise a little bit more every day. 
Want to be more confident? Fake it until you make it.
Want to eat less crap? Make minor changes, bit by bit. 
Want a better job? Excel at the one you have, and keep moving up.
Maintain your life: Your car, your self, your home.
Know your flaws intimately. Know when and where you fuck up. Pay attention not to what you fucked up, but the events that led to it.  
Don't worry about failing. Every time you worry about this is one more opportunity for success that you let slip by. 
Spend time around good people that you can gain and learn from. Don't spend time around poison people that drag you down. 
And, possibly the most important one, the only person's opinion that matters in the long run, is your own. You are the only person who can ever make you happy. If it doesn't make you happy now, if it doesn't help you do things that make you happy, if it won't make you happy in the future, or if it's not the repercussion of doing something that made you happy in the past, you really need to decide if it's worth your time and energy.
** Be awesome.**
do not spend all of your youth trying to be as ridiculous as possible, for you will be cursed to spend all of your older years trying to be as normal as possible. 
amazingly, it works the same in the converse sense as well. thats why we have old men on harley davidsons and people who partied too hard in their youth trying to go to back to school and have a normal life.
balance, all things, my friend.
I don't quite understand the benefits of this build; you sacrifice a ton of damage, but you don't gain enough defensively to out right tank anything.. so you are still kiting I would imagine?  What are the benefits of this over a standard glass cannon? 
Just to do a bit of compare-contrast with my glass cannon DH: 
I have half the life per second you do, but I also have lifesteal on my weapon that is similar to yours, and I attack more quickly.  Add to that that my sharpshooter damage is twice as high and I would imagine that I have similar or superior health generation.  Where I think your build truly separates itself from the glass cannon is in the vitality and resistances, not in health regeneration.  
Now, the resistances of your DH are about 250-300 higher than mine, and that gives you about twice as much [damage reduction]( as I have on level 63+ mobs.  Add to that your health being twice as high, and that leaves you with roughly 4x the effective health that I have.  Now, my question is why not focus on that instead of the whole life regen thing; furthermore, if you enjoy the life regen through life on hit in your build, why are you using a crossbow instead of a faster attacking weapon?
What if, for example, you itemized for resist all/vit/attack speed/dex?  You'd have massive mitigation, and tons of life regen through your NT and lifesteal, and in conjunction with a guardian turret + shadow power (gloom) + preparation you could probably tank small packs of mobs.  
It seems like you're attempting to make a lifesteal tank, but why not go full tank at this point because you're already dropping massive amounts of damage for effective health anyway.  Furthermore, in your experience, do the defensive stats you have seem to make much of a difference in comparison to a glass cannon?

Not a day goes by when I dont walk into my stores 'Ladies' room to find a nice bowl of 'shit &amp; menstruation surprise'. The women pee on the floor, leave nasty track marks in the bowl, refuse to flush, leave the sinks running, lock the stall doors from the inside, drop their pads/tampons on the floor, &amp; vomit next to the bowl instead of in it. The mens room just needs to be swept usually.
TL,DR-women are gross. 
Former Nuke-ET on a fast attack sub. Not gonna lie, there were times when it sucked. The school work, while not especially hard, is concentrated and fast paced. Life at sea is challenging to say the least. But it helps that you are not alone, and the guys you serve with become closer than family. I got to see and do a lot of cool things. The work itself is interesting and rewarding. 
And in the 16 years since I've been out, I've never had a problem finding a job. Most of us former nukes sailed through college.
Stick with it. It's totally worth it.

All things considered (and with extensive consultation with very very fuzzy math) you still have about 90 potential trait decisions to make (and obviously a much bigger number of combinations) so customizability hasn't suffered as much as some may fear. This does have some upsides too, as now the clearly "more powerful" traits require more investment into a line to unlock.
It ALSO means you're coerced into taking some more utility traits from time to time, and while you might WANT to completely ignore traits that help the part (like revive based ones) now they may be the best choice in a certain tier and I can only hope would lead to more team-play.
 At least it isn't Diablo 3 guys.

Not sure if I just interpreted the video differently than most everyone, but it only seems that it's tiered in regards to what skill you can UNLOCK at a certain time.  So you have to purchase 5 of the first tier to unlock the 2nd, and so on.
However, you can still equip any unlocked skill in any one of your three utility slots. 
Not sure if people just saw the words "tiered" in the title and assumed, but it seemed fairly cut-and-dry when he went to equip his unlocked skills and all of them were available for each slot. 
 Changes nothing in terms of balancing.  Please calm down
Given that there are way way way more skill points available in-game than there are skills, I feel like it's more of a way to guide players and allow them to experience and explore many of the skills they may not have bought otherwise. This results in players experimenting more with gameplay styles, which is never a bad thing.
it's a very minor setback to you creating your optimal build, don't worry about it.
Looking at from another perspective, as someone who just finished grad school in a healthish field over a  year ago, I would suggest that you absolutely don't do *any* other work but get your degree. Its not an undergraduate degree, your responsibilities won't be just taking tests and nothing else (usually, if its health related, but I'm not quite sure what you're going for) but you will do independent research, maybe teach, and write publications. All of these things take *way* more time than they should, and can't be brushed aside like that paper you write at 4 in the morning or test you pull an all nighter studying for.
Graduate school is a grind. And it can be hell when things aren't working out. There will likely be a point where you hate it, and will want to quit, so don't give yourself a reason to. Heavily indebt yourself if it isn't payed for or you don't get a stipend, try to get fellowships (if you don't have one) but don't do anything that will make you stay in it longer or could affect your chances of graduating. You will just be inflicting psychological pain on yourself. 
*** If you try to do anything during grad school other than grad school, you're going to have a bad time.
I wish I could put a spoiler tag in this subreddit, because some folks won't want to read any further.  If you're queasy...stop reading now.  If you're eating...stop reading now.  If you're queasy and you're eating, you're pretty much fucked if you read any further.
* About 3/4 of the dancers you'll meet are pigs.  Baby wipes everywhere.  Tissues, makeup, glitter, all over the place like the "accessories" section of your local porn shop fucking blew up.  In the change room you'll see girls anal flossing with baby wipes, just to make sure there are no willnots hanging off the poop deck.  You'll see them come in wearing sweats and no makeup.  Shocked the everloving hell out of me to see a dancer who I thought was a solid 8 turn out to be about a 4.5 without her warpaint on.  Kinda ruins the experience of going to a strip club after this.  One needs awesome powers of suspension of disbelief to ever walk through the doors of your local ripper shack again.
* I was in the booth one day, just after opening.  A few early birds had come in, and one fella was getting a couch dance.  I didn't see the beginning of this, just the aftermath.  According to the dancer, she was giving her customer a little ass show, as per his request.  Bent over at the waist, she had her hands on the table in front of her.  Customer was enjoying the show, but would put a finger in his mouth and suck it wetly.  She just thought it was weird and kept going.  She flipped her hair over her back, and when she was facing forward, buddy tried to jam his spit-lubed finger up her ass.  I heard the noise she made...it was quite possibly the strangest sound I've ever heard come out of another person.  Half squeal, half scream, and you could tell this wasn't a happy noise.  I heard the doorman on the stairs, I put on another song and ran over.  Doorman had buddy by the belt and the collar and was walking him not-so-gently to the door.  His feet were trying to touch the ground, but it looked like he was miming running.  Unfortunately, the doorman didn't have his hands free to open the door, so he improvised.  I would imagine that the Poop Invader had a goose egg for a while.
* The dancer's change room/locker room was behind the stage, and didn't have a washroom in it.  More than one girl peed in the garbage can...and that sucked balls because chances are, the DJ would be the one to change it.  I walked back there to give a quick roster check to the three girls back there.  This one upstanding young lady was pinching a loaf in the garbage can while the other two were doing their makeup and chatting like this was totally normal.  "Hey!  Fuck off!" I said at a loss for words, "You know I'm going to be the guy who has to change that, right?"  She just giggled and continued pooping.  I spoke to the manager about it, and she told the dancer she would have to change the bag.  The dancer quit on the spot.  Guess who had to change it.  FML.
* Another time, I popped my head back into the change room (you'd think I'd learn), and there's only one girl back there this time.  She was in an odd position, and I'm not sure why I didn't clue in right away, but at this point naked dancers had zero effect on me.  In one fluid motion she removed her hand from her crotch, clutching a lightly reddened tampon.  I left.  See, dancers work 3-7 days a week, 4 weeks a month, and sometimes Aunt Flo comes to visit.  They'll cut the string off the tampon and insert it...fishing it out later.  Some will just stuff the tampon string up there as well...but there have been a few incidents of the cotton pony's tail sticking out of the barn...so most girls just remove the string.
Aside from this, I think it's just seeing behind the curtain that fucks a guy up a little.  Knowing that the girl on stage probably isn't a sex-crazed exhibitionist who wants nothing more than to tease the living hell out of you for a few songs...realizing that some of these girls will be going home alone, or to a deeply dysfunctional relationship...that hurts seeing that shit.
All this aside though, most dancers are amazing people.  Women with thick skin who can soldier through the idiotic comments of the morons who sit in gynecology row (shit like "TAKE IT OFF!!"...well no shit, what do you think she's gonna do? Or the ones who try and convince the dancer to go to a "party" with them afterwards.)  There are a few who are all kinds of different flavours of fucked up, but most of them...if you didn't know they were dancers, you couldn't pick them out on the street.  Well...other than the fact that most off-duty dancers will be wearing loose-fitting clothes, hair tied back in a ponytail, and very little makeup.
*** Strip clubs are messed up places sometimes, dancers are people too.
First of all, alcohol does not kill brain cells.  Not in moderation anyways, that's a myth.  If you become an alcoholic that will result in lost brain cells, but that might not necessarily be the amount of alcohol consumed as much as the addiction aspect of alcoholism.  Tobacco has similar effects on brain development yet cigarettes can be purchased as early as 18.  Also there is no strict defined line between psychological stuff and stuff that physically affects your brain.  Stuff that happens on a purely psychological level such as stress can indeed lead to physical changes.
There is some logic behind the 21 drinking age, but it's more about the safety of the roads.  I don't have statistics to back this up but in traveling to different countries I've noticed there's many fewer young drivers.  In the States every kid these days gets their license as soon as possible.  It's no coincidence either that legal drinking age does not vary by state either despite not being a federal regulation, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act decreases funding for state highways from the federal government in response to lower drinking ages.
*** the high legal drinking age was meant to prevent drunk youths from injuring others while driving, not for their own safety.
&gt;Why should someone be able to rake in hordes of easy cash simply because they are female and are attractive?
You're not addressing her question, you're bitching.  Even in the context of untrained employment, the lucrativeness of stripping relative to the work you've done isn't relevant; if that were your only cause for protest, you should also be upset with the tips that attractive female (and male, for that matter) bartenders/waiters make.
Additionally,
&gt;The stigma is well justified. It's not honest work
What's not 'honest' about stripping? You're aware that it is a legal vocation in New York (and most states), yes?
&gt;My point is that stripping yields such disproportionate gains, and is only an option for her because she happened to be born female with good looks
'Disproportionate gains'? Bullshit. Have you ever heard of the word 'economics'? People are willing to pay more to see boobs than they are to eat a pizza. Attractive people willing to strip are in more demand than pimply teenagers willing to deliver pizza. Your irk is not with strippers, but with society. 
**** Stripping is a profession, just like trades are. Being attractive is a marketable skill, just like being smart/strong/educated is.  Get over it.
tardy ninja edit: "deliver pizza" tagged in for "bake pizza".
Stripping to pay for college is just kind of sad. When it's years down the road and you're in a career that your degree got you, are you really going to be proud that you stripped to pay for it? I know I wouldnt.
Also, don't be surprised if most guys won't want anything to do with you and that the ones who will will be scumbags.

 You can't turn a hoe into a housewife
Just want to comment that many girls accidentally get into drugs because the atmosphere in a strip club is "party' and "fantasy". This two mindsets do not encourage sobriety. Most people in the club are buzzed or beyond, or strait up self medicated.
My sister was no tee totaler when she started at 18, but it was intimidating and started doing Xanax to cope at work. Then Ecstasy came out and she was using that and coming down with the xanz.
Then she started using oxy long before anyone knew what it was or that is was so addicting, because being in six inch heels every night was wrecking her feet and knees.
I saw a smart, beautiful girl turn into a girl who was snorting 150 bucks a day in oxy etc, now she is a felon (just from having rx drugs with no rx in her name, each pill was one felony, she had three), lives with a one legged old bastard in a trailer park and can barely keep track of a conversation. 
She will probably never be completely clean from pills again.
She doesn't think she has a problem. She's washed up at 40. I love her.
The risk is that you are there to provide a fantasy, and only the girls who get on board with that mentally are the top earners. Everyone has tits and ass, and most of them will sell it, instead of working all night, they go out to eat, go back to the hotel, and three minutes later they have their grand. 
Paid by the hour, not by the song, you see.
If each song is 20 bucks, 3 for fifty...that's a shitload of hustling. And rubbing. And nasty chat. And bad breath. And germs. And pawing. And misogyny.
stripping only seems easy to men.

I'd say see it a larger timeframe.. Decide if you think the stigmatism of being an ex-stripper fits with how your future self might think back at your choice now. Side effects of stripping usually include keeping secrets and sometimes fight rumors that doesn't fit your style years from now, or even be true.. and then you [french fry when you should have pizza.]( 
 Don't.
In my experience, I moved to a liberal college city in a liberal state where I felt I could be as me as I wanted to be without having to face those negative reactions OP mentioned. But about a year and a half after moving to that town, I bonded quickly with a friend I met and I decided to come out to him- you know, just to clear the air as I hadn't officially come out yet. He told me he didn't want to be my friend anymore, as simple as that.
That was a very difficult realization to get over, that I could be in a community in which I felt very safe and still have to occasionally deal with that kind of rejection. There are a couple other examples, but nothing too much worse than the one above.
Whenever a hint of nervousness or anxiety tries to creep up, I remind myself I'm brave for being who I am, and I remind myself that I live in America: I deserve to be who I am, and to receive the same rights as everyone else in society. If ppl have problems with me, they can go fuck themselves: I love my partner and I love myself, and that's all that matters.
 I love where I live and who I am, but sometimes there's shit you have to deal with.
*&lt;It's an x-post from /r/Soccer ( where I was advised to post it to other reddits to get wider audience as well - after many props to my dog, I figured the photo may belong here :)&gt;*
Dear Redditors!
As you may know, this year Poland (along with Ukraine) is a host to UEFA Euro, one of the biggest football (or soccer ;)) events in the world. Football is my passion since I've been a baby and I'm conscious such an opportunity will probably never appear in my homeland again (not in my lifetime, at least). Being on the new National Stadium with all those thousands of people, shouting my throat off cheering for my team is something I so very much wish to pull off. Something I always only watched in TV and suddenly it seems to be possible to try fot myself! However, getting the tickets in the cheapest categories is almost impossible (even though I'm monitoring the market nearly 24/7 from last year November, when the sales started..) and the better ones are so much unaffordable for me. The championships begin in two weeks so I was starting to lose all hope when suddenly a great thing appeared!
So, getting to the point - one of the Polish companies started a competition in which they fund one of the competitors a VIP package for the semi final for three people - which means, I could take my parents, improbably huge football fans as well, with me! To have an entry, one has to depict the answer to the question "How ready are you for cheering the Polish national team?" and put at least one bottle of the vodka this company sells in his picture. Then, after the voting, the top 10 pictures go under the jury meeting where they select one winner. The competition started three days ago and lasts till June 17th so I would greatly appreciate any support till then!
My entry in full res is here:  (it's also the thread's photo). As you can see, I displayed some of my collection of Polish national team-themed accessories - bedding, towel, pillows, pendrives, key fobs, national shirts, hats, scarves and so on. Along with me is my dog (also dressed as a player :)) and I'd like to assure you I was pouring water to his bowl, not vodka :) Beforehand, I thoroughly cleaned the bottle to make sure there is no alcohol left in case he drinks it while taking photos ;)
So, if you find my story and picture interesting, please do these three simple steps:    
1. Like the profile:     
2. Accept this app:      
3. Click the red thumb-up icon in the lower left with "Głosuję!" ("I vote!") beside under this link: 
If you could do this, I would be so very grateful! It's a great opportunity and it simply tears my football heart apart when I think I could miss an event such big. Thank you so very much in advance :)
**In the comments on /r/Soccer I found out that this info may be useful for those of You who would like to help but decide not to vote because of having to accept the app: "If one does not feel comfortable voting because of having to accept the app, please note that you can accept it, vote and then delete it from your Facebook - it won't affect the vote as far as I know :)"**
* :) So: I've been loving football with all my heart since I was a child, I can't afford costful tickets and the cheap ones are unobtainable, there is a competition in which I could win tickets for me and my parents, two paragraphs above is the instruction how to vote for me. If you do, thank you good Sir/Madam! :)*
You'll often hear two different definitions of inflation. 
1) The increase in money supply
2) The increase in prices
Here's an example which includes both.  Suppose a nation has 200 million people and $2 trillion circulating among its people.  Then suppose that nation gets another 100 million people and prints another $1 trillion.  In this scenario, it's possible for prices to still say the same because each person could have the same amount of money. Is that inflation?  Well, there's more money out there, but prices remain the same.  For my post, I'll go with the common definition, that *prices increase* over time.  
Why do prices rise at all?  It's a complicated process, but I'll do my best to summarize it. It involves the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and deficit spending.   In order for more money to enter circulation, the Federal Reserve has to print it.  How and when do they do it?  *They can only print money equal to the amount of Treasury bonds they purchase*.  What are Treasury bonds?  They are created when the US spends more money than it receives in taxes.  In order to make up the deficit, the Treasury asks "Hey, who wants to loan us money, we promise to pay you back", and people say "I'll loan you tons of money if you give me X% more years from now."  
So suppose you decide loan the US government $10000 for 10 years at 3%.  The Treasury gives you a bond, you give the Treasury $10000 and the government immediately spends your money on the country's budget.  In the year 2022, you say "I want my $10300 now, here's my bond." The Federal Reserve can choose to jump in and say "We'll take that!"  They fire up their printing presses, print out $10300 of new money, exchange it for your bond, and then destroy that bond.  The end result is that now there's a new $10300 in circulation. 
So that's where new money comes form.  The Federal Reserve works *extremely hard* to try to print just the right amount of new money.  They want to print out enough to keep up for new population trends.  They also want to print out a little bit more so prices rise by about 2-3% a year.  This is purposely done.  The rational is that if you try to keep your money in the bank for decades, it basically loses purchasing power, and money in the bank doesn't help the economy.  So, with 2-3% inflation on hand, people are encouraged not to sit on money, but to invest it or spend it.  That keeps economies going stronger.  If inflation hits higher amounts, such as 5%+, people start exchanging cash for gold, property, and other goods, with the hope that they won't lose wealth.  But doing this also slows economies down because money isn't being used efficiently enough.  
 The Federal Reserve prints new money because the Treasury Department printed bonds because the US government had deficit spending.  
She hates going out in public, and her displays of violence decrease drastically around strangers unless we're at home. In middle school we once had open gym together (Only once, thankfully) and during that time I was reading a book in the corner. 
She ran over and asked me to play dodgeball with her, and I said "I can't I don't want to break my glasses". So she grabbed me around my upper arm right above my elbow and raked her nails hard.
I ended up walking to the office crying from the pain with blood running down my arm. They asked who did it and I told them "my little sister". They just said "Oh, sisters" and bandaged me up. Any other student relationship would have likely gotten a detention or trip to the principal's office for harming another student.
I'm not sure how well professional help would do if she refuses to go to the appointments. Years ago we had been sexually molested by our ex-step-brother and family tensions were running high (because no one knew and didn't believe it when I told them) my ex-step-mother suggested we go to a therapist to "straighten them up". 
It was rather ironic that she planned her own ousting, since the therapist believed my side and said she'd have to call the police if I didn't tell anyone about it. (Long story there, not really related to this)
But my sister refused to go to counselling to talk to the therapist about anything. Drawing, school, family, she'd just sit there and stare the whole hour if she had to go. Eventually they stopped trying to convince her to go, and just let her stay home.
*** (Just in case) She's not violent in public often, because she doesn't really go out in public for anything. And she's refused counselling adamantly in the past so no one in my family would be willing to try again.
Especially right after a breakup, you can feel very discombobulated by the sudden giant change in your life. Try to avert that by establishing new routines/goals. 
Be the guy that makes the plans with all your friends, which gives you some planning to concentrate on, and then a lot of fun and sociability as well. Changing some other part of your life might help as well, so that this change in relationship isn't so glaring. By this I mean something like challenge yourself to eat better, start that hobby you are always interested in, talk to those interesting people at work who you only see there, etc...
 Keep your life eventful and moving so you don't have time to let yourself hurt.

Friend of mine had a girlfriend that *loved* getting eaten out. I mean, literally. She would stuff these fruitella sweets in her, and ask guys to eat them out. Now my friend *really* digged this. He would put all kinds of things in her (mostly sweet) and then suck, bite or finger them out, then eat it.
On an occasion, he was out of the country for two months. He did an educational minor abroad. On return, he and his girlfriend naturally resumed their vaginal gastronomy. To "celebrate" his return, she put in the first thing he'd ever eaten out of her: fruitella sweets.
He told me he remembered very clearly that they bought a new roll of them. They were strawberry flavoured, his favourite. She put three of them in, one by one. He, exploding with sexuality (it had been months mind you!) could not contain his drives and just started eating her out.
While eating her, he ate the sweets. The strawberry flavour had been completely absorbed by the girls juices and, combined with his saliva, almost formed some sort of kinky cocktail. The first sweet came out, the second, the third, *and the fourth*. He didn't realize it at the time. He assumed one of the sweets must have broken in two, something like that.
Two days later, he had to see a doctor because all of these blisters in his mouth. They would ache like hell. He described it as having the feeling of having burned your mouth by drinking extremely hot soup, all day long. It was excruciating.
He was told he had contracted herpes. The fourth "sweet" he had eaten upon return had actually been a case of "hard herpes" that had drifted into his girlfriends vagina. She cheated on him while he was away.
Friend contracted herpes by "eating" sweets out of his girlfriend.
 For Pyramids, maybe spiders? Creepers wouldn't make a match for any dungeon as they'd blow shit up. Or, Zombies to simulate undead pharoahs? If Jeb could (not exactly needed) but make a Pharoah skin for the Zombies spawned in the pyramid. They could drop sand, sandstone, or a Golden Sword rarely, and Golden Chestplates even more rare, too?
  For Jungle Temples, maybe Cave Spiders? As usually jungles are full of poisonous creatures and such, so..Cave Spiders! Like the above, if Jeb could make a reskinned Cave Spider, that'd be awesome. It could be maybe Greenish to blend in with the Jungle trees. They could drop spider eyes, fermented maybe, and rarely, vines and cocoa beans
 *** - For pyramids, possibly spiders or zombies. If Jeb could reskin zombies into pharoahs, that'd be awesome. Pyramid zombies would drop sand, sandstone, or golden swords and golden chestplates.
 For Jungle Temples, maybe cave spiders as jungles are full of poisonous creatures and such. They could be reskinned to be green.
They'd drop (fermented) spider eyes and rarely drop vines and cocoa beans.
I've observed the same thing with liberal stories. Seriously, I've started hanging out in r/politics's "new" section and it's funny, it's like everything starts out (including comments) immediately getting down-voted if it holds a strong bias (be it liberal or conservative stances) until it it somehow manages to get more people's attention - stuff that makes the front page of the subreddit does have a liberal slant, but I figured the majority reddit's user base probably has a bit of a liberal slat.
**tl:dr** I just always figured there were more liberals here.
TV Series: Game of Thrones. It's on HBO, also a book series. This specific post is a picture of Miss Rose Leslie a Scottish actress that plays the character Ygritte in the show. Her character is known for being the love interest of a major character, Jon Snow the Bastard who is sent to an area known as 'North of the Wall' where he finds the aforementioned Ygritte. Common phrases of hers are "You know nothing Jon Snow" and "Help help, I've fallen down a well and dragons are going to have to come defeat the Others before this series can be concluded."
Redhair, blue eyes, nerds.
Wait, is this lady in some TV show or something? 
**DAT JAWLINE**
I think that's kinda an overreaction... We have a lot of people in the military here in the US, and I imagine a portion of reddit is actually US Military. I know a good friend of mine who is in the marines uses reddit all the time to keep up with news and see cute pictures. Furthermore, the United States really does like respecting and supporting our troops overseas. 
I think posting pictures of deployed or returning troops is pretty far from pro-military propaganda. As far as I can tell, it's just feel-good stuff that strikes a sentimental note for people who have friends and relatives deployed. I'm against war, but I sure as hell support our guys who are fighting it. They're human and need outlets like reddit and cute puppies. I am happy to upvote a post about a veteran coming home to his dog, etc. I find it sweet, heartwarming, and touching. It helps me remember that my friends and relatives who are overseas will be coming home eventually. 
It doesn't make me, or anyone else pro-war. It might make us less anti-troop. But if that's the goal, is it really that nefarious? 
I think most redditors agree that war is bad, but does that have to imply to our troops being bad? 
 I think these posts are just military people trying to connect and enjoy themselves while they're in a hellish situation, and they're upvoted by people at home who appreciate the sentiment. I don't see why the government would spend money sharing pictures of cute puppies. 
I have a degree in English Literature. The correct answer is ALWAYS to use the pronunciation that would make you sound like less of a douche. More often than not, this is the common pronunciation. Unless you're in a situation that necessitates absolutely correct pronunciation then you should follow your company's lead. If you're the one who says the word first, you may pronounce it however you wish. However, if somebody already set the standard you almost always will look like a huge fucking douchebag by correcting them.
 Whichever makes you present yourself as less of a douchebag. 
You need a secondary opportunity to compare this to. You can't just say the "opportunity cost to go to war..." and not relate to a second alternative that can be shown to be lost because of the first one.
My point was, there isn't an opportunity that we have missed out on. In fact, the war has created new opportunities for profit. Hence you cannot say that the opportunity cost of the war was anything (unless you can show, in reasonable terms, that by going to war we missed out on another opportunity).
I'm not going to touch the 'emotional' bit anymore. It was just a weak attempt to tug at emotions to advance your point. You can do just fine without saying "war is bad mmkay."
So, TL:DR, what's the opportunity we missed out on?
If said public transportation did not exist, the employer would need to pay enough money (ie, significantly more) to attract employees who did not require public transportation because they owned a car.  You really, really have to think this through COMPLETELY.
You have an understanding of how some of the highway system, but STATE takes are the one's you're referring to and our/my example speaks to funds that are FEDERAL and there are those that are beyond fuel tax.
This is similar to arguments I've heard from folks that are childless and feel they shouldn't have to pay taxes that go towards education, to which the answer would be:  The children (that aren't your own) you're paying to educate will eventually be the tax base that provides you with benefits (above and beyond Social Security and Medicare) when you've retired.
This wouldn't typically be the source I'd necessarily chose for this, but I'm lazy and it makes the same point that I'm making:

"Lately, however, it's become fashionable to question this. Various Republican leaders have trotted out the idea of a flat tax, meaning a fixed percentage of income tax levied on everyone. And in their hearts they may be anxious to emulate Maggie Thatcher's poll tax-- a single amount that everyone must pay.
Isn't that more fair? Shouldn't everyone pay the same amount?
In a word-- no. It's not more fair; it's appallingly unfair. Why? The rich should pay more taxes, because the rich get more from the government.
Consider defense, for example, which makes up 20% of the budget. Defending the country benefits everyone; but it benefits the rich more, because they have more to defend. It's the same principle as insurance: if you have a bigger house or a fancier car, you pay more to insure it."
I'm unsure what his point is on Social Security, but this is regressive, because there's an income cap on payments (for the poor, this is the largest tax they'll pay).
This must be a bit older, so in addition to the S&amp;L Bailout, add the TARP payments into the mix (below):
"Investments in the nation's infrastructure-- transportation, education, research &amp; development, energy, police subsidies, the courts, etc.-- again are more useful the more you have. The interstates and airports benefit interstate commerce and people who can travel, not ghetto dwellers. Energy is used disproportionately by the rich and by industry.
As for public education, the better public schools are the ones attended by the moderately well off. The very well off ship their offspring off to private schools; but it is their companies that benefit from a well-educated public. (If you don't think that's a benefit, go start up an engineering firm, or even a factory, in El Salvador. Or Watts.)
The FDIC and the S&amp;L bailout obviously most benefit investors and large depositors. A neat example: a smooth operator bought a failing S&amp;L for $350 million, then received $2 billion from the government to help resurrect it.
Beyond all this, the federal budget is top-heavy with corporate welfare. Counting tax breaks and expenditures, corporations and the rich snuffle up over $400 billion a year-- compare that to the $1400 budget, or the $116 billion spent on programs for the poor.
Where's all that money go? There's direct subsidies to agribusiness ($18 billion a year), to export companies, to maritime shippers, and to various industries-- airlines, nuclear power companies, timber companies, mining companies, automakers, drug companies. There's billions of dollars in military waste and fraud. And there's untold billions in tax credits, deductions, and loopholes. Accelerated depreciation alone, for instance, is estimated to cost the Treasury $37 billion a year-- billions more than the mortgage interest deduction. (Which itself benefits the people with the biggest mortgages. But we should encourage home ownership, shouldn't we? Well, Canada has no interest deduction, but has about the same rate of home ownership.)"
 Rich benefit MORE from federal taxes, multiple examples provided
How about we go with Imperialism? ehhh? The hypocrisy and myopic views in politics today astound me. Everyone is so consumed with the fact of being "right" rather than doing something worthwhile. Why start a war when we already have debt. Neither side has it right as many can plainly see. Just like the crusades before, this will end in failure if continued. Friends, trolls, and Redditors lend me your eyes.
Pheer my rhetoric bitches.
That is a complex question, to be honest. It's not about 'drawing the line' it's about which social programs, government agencies, and other budget items are effective.
Many people seem to believe varying social programs are not needed, wasteful, or targeted at religious groups.
Many people think certain government agencies are not worth the investment.
I think it's pretty clear that no one is arguing against infrastructure, so can we just throw that out? Basic infrastructure such as roads, rail, and airport. Those are fine.
Social programs are probably the hardest to come to agreement on. One clear one is UHC. Reps want health care reform, but they don't want a single payer solution nor a government mandated 'option'. Honestly though, this question is about as big as politics can tackle.
/ I don't want to get into it all, but the 'line' is basically what defines Dems and Reps. Asking that question isn't a short, sweet, or accurate answer.
Just out of curiosity, what would you suggest?  Also, I wouldn't necessarily characterize this as "dems gutting social security".  A Republican controlled legislature must be bargained with because the Tea Party Fucks are perfectly willing to watch the country BURN rather than compromise.  All these links concern the Debt Ceiling deal that ultimately was agreed upon by the President and the Legislature (Democrats and Republicans) stating that if $1.2 trillion in cuts couldn't be agreed upon by a certain date, automatic cuts in entitlements (Social Security and such) as well as DEFENSE would kick in.  AUTO-FUCKING-MATIC.  What did the Republicans do?  This:

This is what the phrase "lying fucks" was designed for.  Bring troops home and reduce defense spending.  Redesign the entire military training regimen so that our soldiers are actually prepared for the situations they're put in (other than Seals and other special ops, this is NOT what we're training our soldiers for).  
To clarify, before I'm called a pacifist hippy:  I'm a veteran, Libertarian (but barely still) and have many friends who will NEVER be remotely the same again, physically or mentally, as a result of the two wars we've been in the last decade (which, incidentally, the costs of which were NOT included in the budget - don't know what kind of logic that is/was - and are a large part of our Debt predicament).
 All links refer to Super Committee failure, Republicans are lying fucks.
I think the point is, policies of the United States as a whole have ENABLED the rich to become rich. Most people didn't just get that way on their own. They were able to take advantage of economic policy which tries to maximize GDP, often at the cost of marginalizing the blue collar worker. And that's fine. One just needs to realize that, for the most part, it was the policies as a while which enabled that monetary gain, and support the people who were marginalized by those same policies.
** Rich people didn't get rich in a vacuum, they became rich at the expense of poor people. They need to realize this and correct the imbalance through social programs.**
History does repeat itself. But I am pretty sure that is what you meant to say.
even though it was short
On the second point? Did you actually answer my question? No, you continue to deny that the tax cuts had anything to do with the growing income disparity despite the fact that even a cursory look at the history will tell you that the income gap skyrocketed after Reagan began the race to see who could cut more taxes. What is your explanation for the growing income gap? Of course, wrapped up in this question are even more questions, like why do you think some people are poor and others are rich? And using that explanation, what's changed in the past 30-40 years to make more people poor?
The problem with NCLB and Medicare Part D was that they weren't paid for and they were poorly written legislation, but just because some legislators are jackasses doesn't mean we should never again try for education reform or healthcare reform. In fact, you brought up Obamacare, which the CBO predicts will lower the deficit, proving my point, because as flawed as Obamacare is (and we would probably disagree about how it is flawed, but I digress) it still is movement in the right direction.
You bring up the 2000 recession, which is interesting. Do you think recessions are not inevitable? After 8 years of expansion, yes, there was contraction, but how is that related to the surplus? You say that the realization that government wouldn't pay down the debt was the reason for the Bush tax cuts, but how is that possible? We were paying down the debt, until Bush's tax cuts. Now, if we had payed down the debt like we were doing until the Bush tax cuts, we would have the flexibility to run deficits during this recession in order to ensure that people who lost their jobs in the private sector either found a job in the public sector or received unemployment benefits long enough to buoy demand while the private sector recovered.
This brings me back to your first two questions. Our government uses taxes to invest in the things that we as a country hold to be important, that's really it. So, if we as a society agree that poverty is more than just lazy people or dumb people who can't hack it like the rich kids, we could spend the taxes on things like education, healthcare, ensuring fair labor practices, maternity/paternity leave, and other things that benefit most citizens.

**We tax those who have more so that we can provide services that benefit the country as a whole**
Yes, you DO only have the great life you do because of socialist policies. That's a fact. That is not, however, the same as claiming that we would have none of the *things* we have without the government. You have the great life you do, more than for any other reason, because of the social policies passed in the 20th century, including workplace safety laws, minimum wages, health care, clean water, and all of the laws that protect you from 'the man' (the list goes on and on), all of which conservatives have been trying dismantling for decades. 
&gt;"most of the services ... were provided for well before gov't provided them."
Really? Like what? And how did it compare with what we have now? Those services were terrible compared to what we have now. 
&gt;"that has a lot to do with the general improvement in the American quality of life over the last 120 years"
Yeah, and what do you think drove that general improvement? Magic? For fuck's sake, get your clown head out of your fat ass, and read a book that is more than just Republican nonsense and propaganda. You have zero facts on your side, and you can't back any of your claims with evidence. 
TL:DR; You are making shit up, and/or parroting the talking points/rhetoric you heard on Faux Newz.
edit: just for the record; even if we assume that every 'thing' that is available now would have been available with zero gov't investment, you would be too poor to afford any of it anyway. The middle class was born because of government rules and regulations within the capitalist markets that we all enjoy.
Anything that isn't infinite is, by definition, limited.
In seriousness, though. Fuck limited editions. 4 days? 4 days, a shit ton of people undoubtedly bought it simply BECAUSE it was limited, so they could flip it around for more money. It's a fucking pre-order. The product hasn't even been finished yet.
Let anyone who wants to, up until July or August pre-order, and produce the number that have been ordered. Still limited, no longer being produced, and it actually gives people who ACTUALLY want it to be able to get it. And they make more money, because people who want their product can actually buy it. They're actually losing money I'd give them. I'm not pre-ordering the collector's edition. It's either standard or loot. 
 I didn't know it was available and I'm pissed
Just a moment, let me grab my trusty piece of paper! I tend to lose track of my thoughts easily (stood a little too close last time Pinkie broke the fourth wall). There we are!
Well, first off, buck what everyone else thinks! Pretty much the only people I know that don't know I'm a Brony is my family and that's because they can be a tad judgemental and I can't get away from them. If people start calling you gay, girly, or otherwise; that automatically gives you full right to ignore them and just be yourself. What I do is I try to not hide it and act like Fluttershy, but also not flaunt it around like Rarity with a designer cashmere sweater; I would be more like Applejack whereas I I don't openly flaunt it, but I flaunt it subtly with a remark such as "Be back in a half hour. It's pony time!" or something.
 Remain calm, take Dycus's advice and don't worry about what other people think of you. And in terms of where you should start on reddit, the subteddit itself is a pretty good place. Though you ought to check out some fanfics I've read (both still in the making): Silent Ponyville: Inferno, and another that I can't think of the title right now. I don't have the links, I post when I do.
I would have asked more questions about my treatment. I had a sarcoma in my jaw muscle twice. The first time I had it removed the surgeon hid the scar by cutting behind my ear. When I relapsed in the same place the same surgeon removed the tumor by making a much more visible cut in my cheek. I'm sure there was a reason to do so, but I didn't ask before hand why he couldn't do the same as before or hide it in a different way. I now have a very visible scar that I often get questions about even 4 years post surgery/3 years off treatment.
I think I have an unnecessary very visible scar because I didn't ask ask a simple question!
It's just one of those things. Had Hitler said people with brown hair and silly mustaches were the master race, everybody would've told him to fuck off; if he'd been blonde-haired and blue-eyed, he might not have been so convincing. Sometimes people will only take you seriously if what you're saying isn't self-flattering (possibly because self-flattery has a high correlation with dangerous rationalization: "We're the vanguard of the proletariat!" "I am the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, your Lord and Savior!" "We, the government, acted just in time to save everyone from economic catastrophe!" "If I jump off this bridge, I'll fly!"). Reflexively, if you say something that's obviously bad for you if it's true, people tend to listen. 
 It is what it is. : /
Thanks, though, and likewise.
You mentioned Probation Management companies. This is something that I believe many people have no idea exist. I was given "unsupervised" probation for a misdemeanor damage to property. My "unsupervised" probation was supervised by one of these companies. This company charge me a monthly fee for the "unsupervision" of my probation. I had to come in once a month and check in with a "case manager". The only difference between "unsupervised" and supervised, was that I met with a "case manager" instead of a Probation Officer. 
 Probation Management companies are a crock of shit...
Here's the problem with that.
Let's say we're talking about a 5 gallon container of water. It displaces an equal volume of air. The refrigerator is set to 40&amp;deg;F and the outside air temperature is 75&amp;deg;F.
The heat added to a system is equal to Q=cm&amp;Delta;T.
For the air, c = 1 J/g&amp;deg;C, m = 0.019 kg, and &amp;Delta;T = 25&amp;deg;C
Q = 361 J
Let's say 1 kWh costs $0.13.
1 J = 2.78x10^-7 kWh
This 361 J energy savings will net about $0.0001 per door opening cycle. That's 1% of a penny. This estimate doesn't take into account the efficiency of the refrigerator, but is so small that it's insignificant anyhow.
Now, that 5 gallons of water is equal to 18.972 L, which weighs about 19 kg. Let's say we were to put the container in with room-temperature water.
c = 4 J/g&amp;deg;C, m = 19 kg, and &amp;Delta;T = 25&amp;deg;C
Q = 1900 kJ
1900 kJ costs about $0.07. It takes over 5000 times more energy to cool 5 gallons of water from room temperature than it does to cool the same volume of room-temperature air. You could put the water in already cold, but the point here is that the energy savings are so small with this trick that you can screw up and lose money overall just by starting with room temperature water instead of cold water.
However, it is worth mentioning that a greater thermal mass inside of the refrigerator will cause it to change temperature more slowly, which requires the refrigeration system to cycle less frequently, which does save a bit of energy and extends the life of your refrigerator.
 Don't pee in the big jug in the fridge.
My first comment, but I think it might be a useful tip. If companies are acting the same in the US as they are in Europe, you might be able to get some part time work as a market research interviewer. Firms are shit scared of losing customers, so they ask us to do field/telephone surveys to find out what they can do to keep 'em (preferably without dropping ridiculously high costs). It's usually casual, client based, and you can put down for the hours your able to work and cancel at short notice if needs be. It's hardly reliable, but gives you some extra cash to play with, if you can stand saying "Hi, my name is PamCakers, and I'm calling from Big Market Reseach Group on behalf of DickholeCorp., we're just running a very short survey..."  ten thousand times a day. There's no real qualifications or experience needed, at least not with any of the ones I've heard of, and they provide telephone interviewing and Public Interface training, which looks good on a resume
My SO, our two room-mates and I also keep an eye on the gas and electricity meters to make sure we're not using to much, and we put the money we save into a Shit Happens jar. We all have minimum wage jobs, so if something important breaks, it'd be a catastrophe if there was no back-up. The money we save from reducing utility usage (about 2-5 euro a week each) goes into the jar so we're at least part of the way to repairing or replacing something if there's a disaster.
 Get work as a market researcher, metered electricity/gas/water, and put the money saved in a Shit Happens jar.
The problem of quantitative easing is not the fact that the money is created, but who gets the money in the end.
At present, QE is used to purchase government bonds. This attempts to flood the market with more liquidity. However the prospect of making huge profits from QE activity ensures that the financial market just keeps throwing the money back into bonds After all, QE rewards bond holders by paying them big money. The result is a market that wishes to hold more bonds.
I would suggest a different strategy for QE. Rather than paying bond holders with the money, the Fed pays the money into *Treasury*. This would then function as an alternative source of revenue. The Federal Government would then use this money in the same way as ordinary tax revenue. This would include a drop in the issuance of new bonds, as some money is being sourced via QE rather than from the marketplace.
**QE money should be sent to the US Treasury and act as a secondary stream of revenue to taxes, inflation permitting**
They have almost no primary stats or resists. The belt I use has 72 resist all &amp; 135 dex and 100vit, and 450armor. This not only reduces more damage than String of Ears it also effects all sources and helps with my dps.
The reason string isn't great is because I have ~98% damage mitigation buffed, the base 20% off the mobs attack is actually only a difference of closer to 2%
If you have 95% DR and want to reduce all damage by 20% you only need to increase your over-all resists/armor by 1%. 96% DR will have you taking 20% less damage than when you were at 95% DR. String is actually misleadingly bad.
 the belt would be awesome for people that have zero mitigation, but once you have sturdy DR there are significantly better options.
my math isn't skewed or flawed.
the 30% matters because its factored into your DR. 
* DR = 1 - (1-resist%) * (1-armor%) * (1-melee%)
The resist and armor % formulas:
*  totalarmor/(50*Mlevel+totalarmor)
the resist formula is the same except 5 instead of 50 and resists instead of armor.
if you plug in the above values all my %s add up.
if you plug in the values above against a llvl 63 monster you get 75% resist, the number I was using to make my example. We can use 90% DR as a target instead of 75% but it doesn't change that the belt isn't very good. Actually, the more resists you have the WORSE the belt becomes. 75% is pretty generous.
The straight damage is absolutely effected by monster level because the formula for damage received is:
*  Damage = (Basedamage * (1+scaling%) * (1-totalDR%) * (1-incomingdamagereduction%)) - block
because totalDR is dependent on monster level, incoming damage reduction is also effected by monster level, thats the beauty of multiplication. 
 the more armor you have the worse String of Ears is, and its not very great to begin with.

I just broke up with my bf of 3 years because of communication and compatibility problems. I struggled through months of us not working. I tried to bring it up here and there, but he either didn't want to talk about it or yes'd me to death with nothing changing. It wasn't the first time I've loved someone, but it was different to me and I'm still waiting to be able to get through a day without blinking and seeing his face. 
What really pushed me into ending it was the fact that I wasn't happy. A lot of things he was doing was hurting me and I felt that I loved me more than I love him, so why was I staying here to hurt?? He wouldn't change back into the person I fell in love with and I wasn't about to force him into it. Does it ever stop feeling miserable once you've broken up with someone you love?? I promise to get back to you if it ever does. But I've only been at this for about a month. People keep telling me it'll get better with time, but this pain is miserable. 
Giving you all sides of the situation is important. It sucks. It sucks beyond anything I've ever gone through and probably more than you can really imagine right now. But I trust that I'm awesome enough to find someone who's, not perfect for me, but can at least talk to me when issues come up. If you think the issue between you two could be resolved but you guys just can't seem to, then maybe it'd be better to part (before you drag it out and hate each other) and find the person who's looking for you.
 Here's both sides of the coin. It'll hurt like hell to leave her, but you gotta decide what you deserve.
Okay, I appreciate the thoughtful response and I'm going to attempt to formulate a proper counter-argument. It will be long and I'm going to do it in a single pass because I don't have a lot of time to go back and edit, so please forgive any repetition or errors.
Let me give my interpretation.
First, think about the title: Antichrist. In Von Trier's world, the Antichrist is not a figure of evil. If the Christ is the "savior", the Antichrist is the "anti-savior". This entire film is about Dafoe trying to *save* an irrational Gainsbourg with his Western, highly-Christian-influenced psychotherapy.
So first off, I believe you're wrong. I don't think Gainsbourg is the antagonist. Dafoe is.
I think, among other things, that the film is a metaphor for spiritual awakening. It is brutal, violent, and terrifying experience for *anyone* to endure.
Throughout history, "god" has had either a masculine or a feminine role. In pre-agricultural civilizations, "god" was typically female (or at least took on feminine traits), and existed in nature. She was a mountain, or a tree, or a bird, or the sky, or the Earth itself. Humans, animals, rocks, and trees were all part of a whole, and therefore, part of God.  Once agriculture began, human beings started to see an order to the Universe. They started observing the heavens, and noticed that some stars moved differently from the others. They recorded the regularity of the tides, the phases of the moon, and the passing of the seasons. This new-found sense of order had to come from somewhere, so they were attributed to a male (or masculine) God not of the Earth, but of the heavens. Separate from us. There's a great deal more I could ramble on about this, but I'll spare you, since that's the main point: masculine vs. feminine images of God. If you find it interesting, I suggest reading some Joseph Campbell. Good stuff.
Anyway, during their sex scene, we see the almost violent penetration of penis into vagina. I don't think he showed us actual penetration because he thought it would be sexy. Von Trier wanted people to see something that might, to an alien, look like an act of violence.
Dafoe's psychotherapy, in its own way, resembles a form of violence. He's trying to "fix" something that obviously doesn't want to be "fixed". What he's doing is causing her pain, and not in a therapeutic way. It's unwanted mental penetration.
That is not to say that Gainsbourg is a saint...
What Von Trier shows throughout the film is Nature with a capital N. Nature the feminine animist pseudo-deity.
Nature is Dafoe's enemy. It terrifies and disgusts him. The acts of birth, life, and death are images of terror to him. So he's fighting it. He's trying to defeat it. Instead of taking the Right-Hand Path *into* Nature, submitting to Nature the way Gainsbourg seems to be attempting, he seeks the Left-Hand Path. The masculine path. The Christ path. The path of mastery, of control, and of suffering.
Like many of the early psychotherapists, he cannot comprehend the female psyche, so he finds her irrational. Psychotherapy was, for a long long time, biased against women. It held up the male psyche as the "norm", if not the ideal.
And of course, let's not forget, that Dafoe also lost a kid. It wasn't just Gainsbourg. And yet *rather than grieve* he sets his mind to "fixing" his grieving wife.
Because in the spiritual worldview of Dafoe, tragedies need to be fixed. There is an order to everything. We can "battle" our way to victory. While in the spiritual worldview of Gainsbourg, tragedies can't be fixed. Shit happens. Nature can be cruel. There is no cosmic balancing-act going on.
But Dafoe persists. He keeps penetrating until, inevitably, she snaps.
Now sex... sex is something we view very differently in post-agricultural and pre-agricultural societies. Once God becomes a judge, there becomes a standard. Nature becomes the enemy. It's filthy. We begin to cover our bodies. We begin to try to "please" God through acts of sacrifice. Sometimes the sacrifice is literal (goats, bushels of wheat, virgins, whatever), other times the sacrifice is spiritual. We sacrifice our bodies. We sacrifice *pleasure*. We become chaste. We don't eat unclean foods. We don't pursue unclean activities. God is no longer of the Earth, remember, so earthlyness is the antithesis of godliness. Again, it's about control (self-control). The sacrifice of worldly pleasure is called asceticism. Ascetic virtues are held highly in all major religions today, and while they all may not agree on some points, virtually all of them place strict limitations on sex. The emphasis is placed on women to remain virgins until marriage, to submit to their husbands, to hide their menstruation (often expelling them from the community while they do), and they are also described as essentially wild animals that will seduce and manipulate a man with their sexuality. So there is an acknowledgement that women want, need, and even enjoy sex, but it's also emphasized that this is a part of their evil nature.
Compare that to the earliest images of God that we have: 
Do you think the families of paleolithic-era Earth were afraid of their daughters moon blood? No. In fact, it was the source of power. That statue, and the many others like it found throughout the world, is *nothing but the uniquely-feminine parts of a woman's body*. It's all hips, breasts, and a greatly-enlarged vagina. Fertility in the ancient world was a blessing. It was greater than knowledge, greater than understanding, greater than physical power.
Now, back to Antichrist:
You can only see Gainsbourg as the enemy if you subscribe to the Christian notion of morality. This is not Lars Von Trier's attitude, but it is the attitude of Dafoe's character.
So, ultimately, Dafoe breaks through... he becomes the savior he wants to be... and what happens? He destroys her.
And what happens after that? The ultimate form of asceticism! The ultimate self-sacrifice! The destruction of the genitals. The destruction of the offenders. *The destruction of the very things that gave them pleasure and allowed them to create the child they are now trying to mourn*. Now there will be no more creation. Now there will be no more birth, no more life. Now there can only be death.
Skip ahead a bit and Gainsbourg is dead. Dafoe has won *handily*. He didn't just fix her, he fixed her permanently. We get to the scene where Dafoe is wandering in the woods and the women appear.
Let's not forget that the witches that have been burned throughout Christendom have often been practitioners of religions that practiced female worship and nature worship. It's important to emphasize that: Christ vs. women.
If Christ is anti-woman, than what does that make woman? Antichrist.
Now... the women in the woods. Obviously, I feel the movie was deeply symbolic. I don't think anything was meant to be taken as literally being the thing it represents. Even the characters, even their child.
So I see those women as being, well... not women, but "Women"...
Remember, this whole place... the woods, the cabin... it's all a great giant metaphor for Gainsbourg's psyche... or rather, Dafoe's psycho-therapeutic interpretation of Gainsbourg's psyche.
Going back to the three beggars... the three stages of life... birth, life, and death... the child was birth... Gainsbourg was life... which makes Dafoe death... his dick is violent (the penetration), his mind is violent (the psychotherapy), and finally he's killed. He no longer has the tools necessary to produce life.
So what is waiting for him out there in the woods? *Death.* There is no one left to fix. There is no undoing what he's done. There is nothing left to destroy but himself. The women represent the anguish of all women persecuted by men. They converge on him. He submits. Whether he is submitting to Nature or simply to death is unknown...
**** Dafoe's attempts to psychoanalyze his grieving wife is a form of rape. The very name "Antichrist" could be translated as saying "Anti-Patriarchal". The film is about Dafoe's attempts to fight nature and the toll that ultimately takes on their minds and bodies, and it symbolizes the subjugation of women throughout the history of civilization, particularly at the hands of Western religion.
I agree with you to a certain point (e.g., Memento), but it depends on how you want to interpret the term. When I think of "mindfuck" movies, I don't necessarily think of WTF-is-going-on movies, twists, gore, penguins molesting each other, etc.  
  
To me, a movie that leaves me with a complete inability to identify or describe my emotions while watching it (or in the days following) is a "mindfuck." If a movie ends, and I sit through the full credits just staring blankly at the screen instead of looking for funny names like usual, that counts. If someone asks me "how was it?" and the shortest answer I can possibly think of is 5 minutes long, that counts also. While Indie and foreign films are much more likely to achieve this, I don't think you can entirely discount Hollywood.  
  
"Mindfuck" is in the eye of the beholder.
I didnt play Planetside 1, but that doesnt make my opinions any less valid, heres my opinion on some of the stuff you said, even if you dont agree, treat it as food for thought. And sorry for the length.
I think that the crosshair problem is just poor implementation of a good idea. I cant stand the idea of CoD style play where it comes down to whoever has the fastest mouse movement, and just running around the map. I like the idea that after moving around your aim is crappy but moving the crosshair will just disoirientate players. I think that the way it should work is just an increase in bullet spread for half a second or so. The spread would be larger or smaller based on the size of the weapon, whether you are turning or running and could be reduced or completely removed in the case of light assault classes with certs. Light assault classes should use light weapons and be able to move around freely while firing them. Heavier classes however should have to stop and look down their sights to be able to get any accuracy, of-course the upside of this is that their weapons do far more damage.
The ironsights issue i think is again poor implementation of a good idea. The idea of having to look down the sight of the gun to be able to hit something is a good one, but your accuracy without it shouldnt be god awful. Additionally, using ironsight should be the norm, it shouldnt be thought of as a massive hassle. If a light assault class is running around with a pistol or light automatic rifle or similar they should be able to switch between sight and no sight quickly, as well as move at maybe 75% speed while sighted. A heavier class would take longer to sight, not by much, and move slower while sighted. The idea behind all this being that the tactic would be to run/sprint to a position, and then look down your sights to start killing people, instead of running around and pew pewing away as if you have laser vision. But again, increased non-scope accuracy for light classes.
As far as movement speed goes, they should either remove the endless sprint option or make a stamina bar. Additionally after sprinting your sights should take longer to use, and your accuracy should be of. If they do implement a stamina bar, the lower your stamina bar, the less accurate you should be. Again all of this would have a lesser effect on light classes. As far as MAX suits are concerned, i think it would be a cool idea to have them able to sprint faster than normal infantry, but to do so would mean you are completely unable to shoot accurately (think your screen bouncing up and down) and have a 1-2 second slow down time.
In my opinion the end goal for balancing infantry should be that a light class can out maneuver a heavy class, but a heavy class can outgun a light class. It should be a matter of skill that decides who wins a 1v1, and yes, sneaking up behind someone is a skill. I think that the go-to response when you are being shot from behind shouldnt be turn around and shoot back, it should be get the fuck out of there, find a good position and then shoot back.  At the end of the day i believe that a good fps battle should come down to positioning, the use of cover, flanking maneuvers and the like, rather than who has the better reaction time when everyones just running around out in the open.
Again this is just my opinion, i have not played planetside 1 and do not know enough about planetside 2 to definitively say what they should and shouldnt do, but from what i have seen the devs main concern is balance. They have their money machine in the visual modifications, they can devote their time and programming powers to balance and when this game finally comes out it will be balanced and fun. From what I have seen the developers have listened closely to fans, as they seem to be doing everything right, that Hi-Rez with Tribes: Ascend has got devastatingly wrong.
They are good ideas, just implemented badly. They devs have a strong focus on balance and fun, so dont stress too much.
Wait wait wait a second. Laser driving is not like that at all. You are not trying to provide 3.2V to the laser. 3.2V is how much voltage will be dropped across the laser diode and is the minimum amount you will need. There is nothing wrong with using 5V to power it. BUT, the laser will eat up all the current you give it until it dies. Thus you need to limit the current rather than the voltage. You must know the current rating of the laser. If you give it a little too much, it will work for a few minutes(or less) then die.
There are many ways to do this. The simplest is to put a resistor in series. This will work, but will dissipate power in the resistor. For example, if you want to give the laser 20mA with a 5V supply, resistance = (5V-3.2V)/0.02A = 90 ohms . The dissipated power in the resistor will be (5V-3.2V)*0.02A = 36mW which is not bad at all.
 Regulate current not voltage. Need more than 3.2V. Try a 100 ohm resistor in series with 5V supply.
The article has quite a few inaccuracies. Horthy didn't start serious mass persecution and deportation of Jews until the Germans invaded in 1944.
&gt; Horthy and his government supplied 10,000 Jewish deportees for labor battalions, but otherwise refused to comply. Cautiously, the Hungarian government began to explore contacts with the Western Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender.
It wasn't until he started trying to find a way to join the allies or surrender to them (Hitler got word of this and 'summoned' him to a meeting) that his new government was forced to deport a large number of Hungary's Jews to German camps after they invaded the country.
&gt; Horthy was told he could only stay in office if he fired Kállay and appointed a new government that would fully cooperate with Hitler and his plenipotentiary in Budapest, Edmund Veesenmayer. Knowing the alternative was a gauleiter who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other countries under Nazi occupation, Horthy acquiesced and appointed his ambassador to Germany, General Döme Sztójay, as prime minister. The Germans originally wanted Imrédy, but Horthy had enough influence to get Veesenmayer to accept Sztójay instead. Contrary to Horthy's hopes, Sztójay's government eagerly proceeded to participate in the Holocaust.
--
&gt; It is often argued that Hungary's "relatively mild" anti-Jewish Laws, which were passed under German pressure, appeased the Nazis enough to create a relatively safe environment for the Jews before the 1944 German invasion.[36] It seems certain that the survival of 124,000[37] Hungarian Jews in Budapest until the arrival of the Soviets would have been impossible without Horthy’s years of foot-dragging reluctance to implement German orders.[38][need quotation to verify] On 15 July 1944 Anne McCormick, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times wrote in defense of Hungary as the last refuge of Jews in Europe, declaring that “as long as they exercised any authority in their own house, the Hungarians tried to protect the Jews.”
 
The article deliberately fails to mention that it was only after the Nazis invaded the country and Germany asserted full control over Hungary that they started to fully comply with the Genocidal policies of Hitler. The article deliberately attempts to absolve Germany of any guilt in the crimes committed under Horthy when the truth is that almost ALL of the crimes committed against the Jews at that time were to appease Germany. The rise in nationalism and the growing acceptance of these historical figures as 'heroes' is a serious issue and Der Spiegel ruined an important piece of journalism by deliberately twisting the history to avoiding mentioning the fact that Germany played the major role in extermination of Hungary's Jews and that the Hungarian regime was a reluctant and initially unwilling participant.
 The guy was quite bad, used the Nazis to hold onto his own power and complicit in the Nazis' genocide but the most serious crimes of 'his' government didn't begin until Germany invaded his country and forced him to comply as punishment for trying to join or surrender to the allies. 
The quote in the title is completely inaccurate and paints Eric Kessler as a fool.  Further, it ignores the realities that HBO is facing as a content producer in a time when the shift from cable to streaming is still just starting.
  
The ballpark that they can't/won't compete with Netflix in is in terms of quantity of content, not (as your title suggests) streaming ability, which is totally unrelated to quality of production.  Netflix has tons and tons of titles available for streaming, and roughly 75% of them are worthless pieces of shit that nobody really watches.  Kessler isn't interested in competing with Netflix in terms of quantity.  Where he does want to compete is in terms of quality.  Which means that the titles under the HBO brand are series like Game of Thornes, The Wire, The Sopranos, and Band of Brothers.  And honestly, I would pay more for their denser catalogue than I would for Netflix's large one.
As far as competing with companies who specialize in streaming, he would probably like to, but at the moment cannot for economic reasons.  HBO makes its money by being bundled through providers.  They have a large infrastructure that allows them to focus entirely on the production end of things and leaves distribution to other companies.  If they switch to streaming, it hurts their economic model in a way that is not currently feasible with the current ratio of customers who stream content versus those who get it from a provider.  They said as much in response to the HBO Take My Money! campaign. This reality is changing, and will probably happen quickly, but right now this is the reality.  
 hbo wants to compete in quality over quantity, not quality over streaming ability.  its not financially sound for them to provide streaming.
If the government is not supposed to regulate things (one of the "big" ideas of libertarianism), Then that government is, in fact, NOT protecting your from "good" or "bad" corporations.  In fact, there is no such thing as a "good" corporation.  They are completely morally blank, as the only motive of the corporation is profit....if they must destroy the environment to turn a profit, they will, etc. etc.  Beyond that, as we;ve seen over the last decade plus, deregulation does NOT lead to more competition, but rather less.  If the government does not step in to make sure that smaller less cash rich companies cannot be swallowed up by the already huge rich companies, then there is LESS choice. An excellent example is every business prior to early 21st century trust busting.  BEfore that, the government didn't regulate the size of corporations....there was less choice, not more.  
  You're wrong on every point, because, well, facts.  
That's a lotta pizzas you had to buy IRL and fake drawings to get fake points on a popular website. karma addict.
Shit you're right would it be completely okay if I changed my TLDR to what you just said?
I think that if Gold and Silver were considered paying currencies, every shop might want to take them.
Now, here is the tricky thing. Silver and Gold have kept on going up on the markets since 4-5 years. It is due to the rarity of the product, and to the fact that you cannot "produce" it, just extract. 
So obviously, gold is not going down in the short / middle term. But how do you pay taxes on gold and silver? Do you declare the wealth as of the day it was paid to you, or as of the day the taxes are paid? 
Now your question is a bit a non-question, because somebody who wants to do that can just purchase gold on the market as soon as a sale comes in. You do not have the metal in your hands, which is much much safer when you think of it :)
 Yes as gold is going up, but it would not make much sense
My story is Paris for the handball. 
Went by myself to Paris from Praaaag (was living there) and decided to scalp and make friends along the way. Bought a case of Kronenberg and went to Eiffel Tower. The way to Stade de France was one of the highlights of my life. Packed in the metro with boys in green singing the entire way. We were applauded by the French people. They'd never seen anything like us.
Stade de France was amazing. The best stadium I've been to in my life. The Irish fans were fantastic. I get goosebumps thinking about it. I was in the heavens, but the view was perfect and I didn't feel like I was anywhere near as high up as I was.
Can confirm lots of Irish anger after the match, followed by, "well, let's get drunker". Couldn't tell it was a handball from the upper deck on the other side of the pitch. Thought Gallas was offside though.
Lots of pints and disappointment. Slept on a bench outside Gare de Nord and missed my 6am train to Amsterdam by about 10 seconds. Got to enjoy Amsterdam and still made my flight to Cork despite the worst rain in 200 years. Thankfully, got the last room for the night in an airport hotel (walked past Jack's statue!) since my family couldn't get up to Cork because of the rain, so I didn't look too terrible when they picked me up the next morning
All in all, great craic. I wish we had won and gone to South Africa (certainly would have had a better showing than France), but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world. 
I also decided to go to Slovakia to see a US-Slovakia match. Slovakia won 1-0 on a terrible pitch, but it was pretty cool to be one of 15 non-Slovaks in the stadium. My girlfriend is Czech, so she negotiated with the steward to let us in for a 40 euro bribe. Was worth it.
Was going to go to see the Czechs play Poland in a Euro qualifier and decided not to go.  Good idea, since the Polish hooligans destroyed the city.
got drunk, pissed on eiffel tower, saw henry handball, got drunker, great craic
What most people don't know is that allowin your son to play dress up will give him skills that you can't really learn later in life. He'll have greater empathy for others and will be a faster thinker. It'll even make him better in sports if he chooses to play. Dressing up allows kids to "think" and act like someone else giving them the power to understand and read people better in the future, and in the case of sports it'll make him better at anticipating the opponents next move. 
You're a smart and cool parent!
Grip intensity (1RM strength, like a max effort deadlift) and endurance (holding for time, like farmers walks) are two different things for me... and for most people I believe. 
Sure there is some crossover, but if you can't pick up and hold 600 pounds on a rack pull, no distance of 100 pound farmers walks or holds will increase that grip *intensity.* 
Many people will say something along the lines of, "I've been doing farmers walks for a few weeks/months yet I still have trouble holding my 1RM deadlift." Upon further investigation, these people often have trained grip endurance and can carry "X" pounds dumbbells for "X" distance but they're forgetting that if you want to pick up heavy ass weights you *have to pick up heavy ass weights*; no amount of light weight training will give you that ability. 
**** Do heavy rack pulls for grip *intensity* and farmers walks for grip *endurance.*
Related: There's a particular McD's open 24 hours that's maybe a 10 minute drive away? Now my friend and I hang out sometimes and we have weird schedules on occasion, so we'll be all like "Wanna nom something, only thing open is McD's." Invariably that McD's is slower than goddamn molasses on a glacier. I have no idea what they're dicking around doing back there but the last time my friend went, they had to literally YELL for someone to come to the front so they could order.
Since the McD's closer to where I live has gone to 24-hr drive through, we've never gone back to that shitty-ass McD's. Letters to corporate have gone unresponded to, as well.
EDIT: unavailable personnel and slackers - similar story to yours except far less expensive.
I manage a small local shop in California and most of the stores in town do not offer public restrooms.
The reason?
About 6 years ago or so, a man in a wheelchair went into every business in town and asked to use the restroom.
If it was not 100% ADA complian, he had his lawyer sue them.
Several businesses in town actually had to shut down permanently over this, inlcuding a few restaurants.
He went up and down the coast of California, making millions off of the lawsuits claiming "suffering" from the fact that the restrooms weren't compliant.
A judge finally put a stop to it, saying that while he could file "complaints" he could no longer profit financially from it.
Now, nearly every store has a sign that says "Due to Lawsuits, No Public Restroom Available", just so that it can avoid legal issues.
We have a standing policy that if someone asks to use the restroom, we will let them know we don't have one, but that we can let them "use the employee restroom" if it is an emergency.
That helps to avoid the legal aspect of it.
I agree it is an inconvenience, but sometimes they have no choice!
- Crook in a wheelchair makes restroom unavailable.
get a cheap/free laptop or desktop off craigslist, and put Linux on it for absolutely free! Chances are, you are reading this from a PC that you will be able to install Linux on. You can just pop in the CD, restart the computer, and something like Ubuntu will automatically split your disk so that you can keep windows and put Ubuntu on as well.
You can do everything you did on Windows/Apple, and more. Virtually everything is free. You can install GIMP, basically a free Photoshop, OpenOffice, and stay productive while saving money. There are great, free games. You can learn how to program, and learn in detail how computers actually work, if you have the patience.
There is a whole world of free software that most people know nothing about. If you are new to Linux:

If you become more familiar with it:


but it doesn't stop there... so many flavors of Linux:

totally agree.  i make sure to stay the hell away from downtown personally.  i've been down there once with my cycling class i took this last quarter, and we had a woman try and hit one of my classmates and then her and her boyfriend proceed to call us all bitches for the next 6 blocks as she paced us, not allowing us to get ahead of her.  
 i don't like riding downtown.  i stick to trails and the road in the surrounding neighborhoods.
I actually just purchased a Microsoft X4 sidewinder for a friend. It's a solid keyboard that has a nice red glow to all of the keys. If you are willing to drop about $50 it is excellent. It has a few programmable keys as well. It also allows up to 3 profiles (say for 3 different games you play).
Here's a link, shop where you like. 
Microsoft X4 Sidewinder glows for about $50
The pictures all have different qualities. Some are great while others are a bit ... average. 
 
Great looking picture. Something that could possible be in a magazine.
 
Great lighting and a nice smile. Maybe using a reflector to light up her face a bit more.

I love the color on this one.
 
The colors in this one are pretty good to but the previous picture had a foreground element in the picture which makes it just a bit more interesting. 
 
This would've been a great picture if you would've had a bit more light. Looks a bit sober due to the shadows.

Great looking silhouette.
The car pictures where a bit boring in my opinion. The quality was good and these would be great if you want to sell something on eBay or something similar but they aren't very exciting. Another thing is that if you're trying to take pictures of people a great way of doing this is by holding down the shutter button. Holding it down when setup correctly means you make several pictures and this means someone might start to really laugh instead of pose as if they're laughing. That was something that was missing especially in the last 3 pictures. Hope this helps.
**TL/DR** Great color, take multiple pictures to have pictures that don't seem posed, have fun and good luck.
Lad mig fortælle en kort historie om en af mine veninder, som jeg lærte at kende på HTX.
Vi var i gruppe - jeg havde fravalgt at være i gruppe med de andre nørder, for jeg følte at der var for meget ekko-kammer over vores arbejde og vores fokus - vi havde alle de samme evner og interesser, ser du - og vi skulle lave et otte-ugers projekt.
I den første uge arbejdede vi med noget fundamental research - hvad indebar vores projekt, hvad skulle vi bruge, hvilket arbejde skulle vi udføre, hvilke kilder skulle vi have fat i, og i slutningen af den første uge lavede hun en tidsplan over hvad der skulle ske hvornår.
Denne her tidsplan, som strakte sig syv uger ud i fremtiden, kom til at holde. Jeg syntes at det var det vildeste jeg havde set en person gøre med hjernen.
Måske er det ikke så fantastisk for dig, og hun var heller ikke selv imponeret, men jeg viste det til nogle andre, og hun fik meget ros, og vi pointerede alle at her var en ting hun havde en evne til, som hun ikke selv vidste hun var god til (og måske var hun heller ikke særlig god - andre var bare dårlige).
En af de ting jeg lærte, var at jeg var god til at formidle nye ting til folk.
Hun er nu sagsbehandler, og jeg er folkeskolelærer.
*** det handler ikke om hvad du kan lide, det handler om hvad du er god til.
You don't need the card reader to make a payment to a payee - only to create a new one - obviously this makes sense since if someone has captured your login details somehow, you don't want them to be able to create themselves as a payee and steal all your money.
You obviously take the security seriously and protect your details as best you can - many people I know just don't think about that stuff carefully enough - so I think it's right (and I'm sure you'd agree) that the bank makes a real effort to protect people from their own stupidity (weak, obvious passwords, writing it down on a post-it stuck to the laptop) or ignorance (people unaware of key-logging/back door viruses, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks etc).
 You appreciate the risks, so I can appreciate your frustrations - but would you really want to bank with a company that doesn't take a paranoid approach to security? 
At two different points in my childhood I had dreams that my father died in some sort of vehicle accident. When I was 18, he was killed by a car while riding his motorcycle. The night he died I dreamed we were walking through a forest and he was explaining to me exactly what happened - many of the details of which I did not find out until several days later.
About a year after that, I was alone at work, in a mall store. A woman I had never seen before came in, looked around a few minutes, and approached me. She said she was compelled to speak to me because I had an aura around me, and I had lost someone dear to me but that he was still with me and watching out for me, and I should not be sad. She then walked out and I never saw her again.
 Spoke to my father's ghost the night he died, a year later had a "psychic" who had no knowledge of it speak to me about him.
The first time I said "I'm so hungry I could eat the asshole out of a skunk" my wife about fainted...  I had thought it was pretty common before that. I guess I was wrong...
- Skunk asshole tastes good
I don't see how it could be in HD when the lowest resolution to qualify for HD is 1,280×720. Unfortunately I have no idea if FFX is coming out or not. If BlueMaxima doesn't know, then not many will... That guy is everywhere.
A PS Vita is 960 × 544, which is also known as qHD. This is because it's a quarter of full HD.
**** Vita games can't be "HD".
~~Lasher elites are a nightmare. They spawn very frequently on azmodan entrance.~~ Phasebeast elites MURDER mages especially if they spawn in the azmodan entrance area with no room to even run. Azmodan's broken ass hells grasp REQUIRES wizards to take worm hole teleport which makes killing elites very painful since you will be missing fracture.
Cydae entrance also has no waypoint. If you start from her area and don't get 5 elites on the way you have to find it somewhere else and walk back TWO ZONES. 
TLDR- Don't bother if you're a wizard. Unless you're grossly overgeared
Well the important thing is that a relatively small number of people could makes a big profit, if a relatively larger number of people might potentially get hurt by it so be it. Tl/dr fuck em, I got mine.
Sure glad I wasn't eating when I read this.... Also, love the  Sweet face love!
I don't watch Zisteau, mainly because before he joined Mindcrack, I had a friend who had seen his channel, and said friend would absolutely not shut up about Zisteau. Because of this, I was bias against him, and whenever he showed up in other's videos I would look for negative qualities. So now, whenever I attempt to watch him, I have a small corner in the back of my mind that is still annoyed by my friend constantly talking about Zisteau and is accentuating everything negative about him (Zisteau)
 I have terrible friends.
I couldn't agree more about 'Boring'; maybe I wouldn't call it boring however. I don't like the LPers who treat it as a vlog. I just don't care. Your life is important, I'm not saying it isn't. I just don't want to watch it.
Etho cuts out so much boring shit it's great. I just got into Zisteau, and so far he cuts out a lot too, he's the 2nd Mindcrack person I've thoroughly enjoyed (the others I've tried just didn't agree with me like those two)
I'll have to give Doc and Nebris a try though, I started watching Nebris a little bit, just got a bit confused with his channel. (In the "first" mindcrack video he mentions playing previously [and acting like I've seen it] but I couldn't find those videos; I like to start things at the beginning,)
I agree.
I'd be happy! I watch all of your videos mostly because they aren't thrown at me repeatedly! Whereas, with Mindcrackers like Guude who's content I still enjoy occasionally, I'm just not able to watch every single one of his videos. 
Having said that, I watch all of Pause's Mindcrack videos. Perhaps due to the shorter length? I find I tune out on 40 minute plus videos like Guude and VintageBeef's, even though it is undoubtedly good content.
- Video length and frequency are factors for me!
Which is good and fine, I think I remember you for John Sickel's site.(Great draft btw, assuming you sign most guys) But somebody who frequent that site should no that there's no definitive right now on pitching. Inverted W is considered a very bad thing because there are some high profile inverted W guys who has been hurt(Strasburg, Prior, Anthony Reyes, Adam Wainwright and Michael Pineda) but there are also examples of Inverted W guys who's had long, healthy careers(Smoltz, CJ Wilson, Marcum).
The fact is that we just don't know enough to be sure. Doesn't mean we don't try to find out. But to say that you "feel confident" that Sale is Mark Prior part 2 is a bit cocky.
 There are educated guesses, but we don't have the ability to be that confident in those guesses.
I own a 3DS, while my brother owns a Vita. I've had it since Summer 2011 (got it right before the price reduction in order to obtain the old games), and I've played it for over 800 hours since then.
The only 2 games I've played on Vita were FIFA (the only reason my brother bought the console for, which I find a little bit foolish) and Uncharted (very great action/adventure game, awesome gameplay, stunning graphics). Apart from these two, I think you can find other games that suit your gaming interest. The only thing that ticks me off about the console is the lack of software ; the hardware is excellent. 
As for the 3DS, I own 10 retail titles : 
Star Fox 64 3D, Kid Icarus Uprising (both shooters, but with major diferences) 
Tales of the Abyss (JRPG with awesome battle system)
Tetris Axis 
Super Pokemon Rumble (simplistic action game, very addicitve) 
Mario Kart 7 (a shallow title in single player ; mp is where it's at) 
Super Mario 3D Land (30 hour Mario platformer, very fun game) 
Need for Speed the Run (impulse buy ; decent game) 
Steel Diver (only title which I didn't really enjoy)
Zelda : Ocarina of Time 3D.
Out of all these retail games, you should start with the Mario titles, Zelda and Tetris, and then branch out according to your gaming interest.
The 3DS also sports backwards compatibility with DS games, opening up a huge library. They look pretty blurry, but it's still playable.
The eShop also provides a pretty limited selection of VC games, and some 3DS Ware. You should take a look.
: Vita is a console full of potential, but it lacks games, while the 3DS could keep you occupied much longer.
The movies did a fantastic job of portraying Middle Earth and gave a great overview of the plot. However, there are the little things and some medium-sized things (think why the Great Battle between the united forces of man and elf and Sauron was being fought, Tom Bombadil, etc.) that were looked over. There are very few movies based on books that are true to the source material in almost every way, but I think LotR does a good job.
Yes, you get more backstory and some overlooked things.
But, you didn't have to tell her twice did you?!
 I'm going to hell for this.
I have had luck with OK Cupid. My girlfriend and I met through that website, and we're moving in with each other in two months - already signed the apartment papers and put down the deposit :)
Also, on OK Cupid, I've only received maybe one or two messages that were crappy / transphobic / whatevs.
Before that, I tried a transgender dating website - transgenderdate.com - and don't get me wrong, I've met a few other transgender girls who I am still friends with online and talk to every so often. It just didn't help me AT ALL for dating, and I got FLOODS of terrible messages from super horny guys who thought I was a desperate she-man starving to pleasure them. Yuckyuckyuckyuckvomit.
I don't drink or go to clubs, so I'm not so helpful in that regard. I go to a decent amount of concerts (I used to be in a band and I know almost everyone else that goes), but that didn't help me in the dating field at all.
- Try OK Cupid, it's generally friendly. Transgender dating websites typically aren't so friendly.
In what pubs are you playing that you have 2-3 coordinated brutes hitting the stand at the same time? If your group is ragtag and theirs is coordinated enough to pull off what you're describing, the problem is a disparity in skill between the two teams. It's easy as hell to get to the stand, but it's even easier for a HoF or any other class to intercept a Brute before it can do shit. I would know, I'm possibly the best Brute in the game and every time I've used it against competitively competent players you get shred up by chain, SMG spam, snipers, and assorted bullshit before you can even get in proper range. There is a reason you don't see Brute at all in competitive games and it isn't just the friendly fire on the fractals. It's the fact that the class is straight up useless if defense knows what they are doing when a Brute approaches from out in the open. 
Competent SMG/Chain user &gt; Competent fast-approaching Brute, every time. If a Brute gets close enough to put fractals on your stand, several people fucked up at the same time.
Egentligen är jag inte förvånad. Jag är arg och besviken, men inte förvånad.  
Här är min analys: Elm och Kim kunde inte hålla bollen i 70 min av matchen. Vi blev uppkäkade av Ukraina på mitten hela tiden. Rosenberg fick nästan aldrig chansen men när bollen väl kom upp så är han för svag.  
När Ukraina hade bollen var dom skickligare, dom kunde spela sig ur sina situationer och vi spelade passivt och var rädda. Dom var helt enkelt skickligare.  
Shevo var grym idag, men sverige är tokkassa på fasta situationer.  
Fixar vi England på fredag är det helt öppet. Jag tror det kan gå men då måste vi spela aggresivare än idag.  
TL:DR: Ukraina är värdnation och vi sög idag.
&gt; It's perfectly valid:
&gt; 1. All A* is M
&gt; 2. All L* is A
&gt; 3. Therefore, All L is M*
I'm glad we agree., because in that case:
1. All abstract objects are mind dependent.  (Your original first premise.)
2. God is an abstract object.  (From your definition of abstract.)
3. God is mind dependent.  (*Modus ponens.*)
&gt; I will not get drawn into a debate about some other argument. This is the equivalent of "Look over there! What in the world can that be?!"
I agree that one of us is handwaving, hemming, and hawing.  I've provisionally granted the validity and soundness of your original argument, and have turned around and provided you with a counterargument to demonstrate that the original argument is suspect.  The counterargument is structurally valid, so the only thing left to talk about is the truth value of the premises.  Premise 1 is unmodified and thus uncontroversial.  Therefore, the source of your objection must be premise 2; but, if god is neither abstract nor physical, then we both acknowledge that there is at least one additional category in which to place things.  If that is correct, then you cannot claim that the laws of logic are abstract simply by observing that they are not physical, since they might fall into the third category (or even some other).
- I'm disagreeing with your original premise 2 by forcing you to acknowledge that you've built the argument on a false dichotomy between abstract and physical.
My friend was in her apartment when the door was kicked in- The guy was holding a stack of phone books and immediately dropped them when he saw her in the apartment.  He had knocked, but since she had just moved in and her husband was at work, she ignored the knock.  Apparently this guy was going door-to-door handing out phone books to whoever answered their door, and breaking-in to all of the empty apartments. As I said, they had just moved in, and all of their worldly belongings were neatly in boxes.  If she hadn't been home, the guy could have taken everything out through the front door and looked like a mover.
ANYWHO, he kicked the door in, immediately dropped the stack of phone books, and her 6-year-old boxer ran at the guy, snarling, as she grabbed a knife from the kitchen.  He immediately ran down the hall, with her dog hot on his heels.  He got away from the dog, but only because she can't open doors.  The cops showed up a minute later and arrested him and his 4 burglar friends in the parking lot with a van of fresh loot.
Guy kicks door in, dog chases him down the hall, she grabs a knife

&gt; But for the most part I've been afraid to convey my thoughts to those around me because I feel I would get labeled as some kind of monster for not automatically sympathizing with Tibet as a victim.
You shouldn't be afraid to express yourself, but before you do, you should try to understand two things:
1.Why do I feel this way about the situation?
2.How am I trying to alter peoples perceptions when I express my opinion on the situation or alternatively "Why do I feel the urge to express this opinion at this particular moment?"
The first is important because it establishes the significance of the opinion/thought. Even if you think you know the reason why, ask "well why is that reason so?" . Also ask "Is this reason true for myself only (I have blue eyes) or is it true for most people (the sky is blue) 
The second establishes how much of your views to share, and in what way to share them. Even if you find your view significant and justified after answering question 1, question 2 addresses the significance and justification relative to your audience. For instance, it can be good to warn someone who smokes about the dangers of lung cancer (not always). But I am pressed to think of a situation where it would be good to reiterate these same dangers to a smoker who has been diagnosed with lung cancer (unless maybe they're still smoking). 
The other point I'd like to make, which goes back to me saying that you're not chinese and you're not a buddhist, is that you should be looking to ease tension by transforming your self, not others. That is to say rather than feeling like you need to sympathize with one side as the "victim" and one side as the "oppressor" (you are transforming these groups in your head, no situation is this black and white), you should try to feel sympathy and compassion for both sides, because both are suffering under the delusion of samsara. Rather than transforming tibetan monks into "taliban" like "so-called" monks, transform your understanding to see why they act how they act. 
Finally, I would like to express my own opinion on the situation in Tibet/China. Now to understand this situation, you must first I think look at what is the Chinese Governments goal, and what is the Tibetan government in exile's goal. Now to me, the Chinese governments goal is to develop the nation of china as a whole, as quickly as possible. Now this is at its face admirable - more people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years in china than any time in human history. But there is a flip side to this coin - this kind of efficiency demands sacrifices, including the rights to political dissent (its not just tibetan protesters who the chinese government is trying to silence, its *any* dissent - including Falun Gong, and democratic student protesters.  

Now I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not the ends justify the means, but I'm of the opinion that they certainly do not. I mean I honestly don't really see how you can approve of the Chinese governments oppression of its own people. You can support a country and not support it's regime. I'm an american and I absolutely despise our government and power structures, and I believe we are guilty of heinous war crimes, pretty much throughout our history. I mean I even approve of aspects of our government (and of the chinese government), but as long as there is injustice inherent in the system, I feel it is my duty to speak out critically about it, so that something can be done. And likewise rather than shooting the messenger when I hear something bad about the american government, I assess the facts, and if I find them to be true, I will spread this criticism to others to raise awareness. 
also one last point on self-immolations - you decry these as being terrorist-like, but I think, that if you study buddhism carefully, you will realize that this is among the greatest expressions of faith in buddhist doctrine one can show. It shows absolute conviction in the doctrine of annatta 
TL:DR;
Avoid circlejerks
Nickles.  
The $X.95 drink special was the bane of my existence as a bartender.  For some reason, if the price was less than a nickle, the non-tippers would just walk away without asking for change.  If it was five cents, suddenly that was a whole different story.  
I remember running out of nickles one night and having to hand out five pennies.  90% of those non-tipping, nickle hoarders just left them on the bar.  
IDK what it is, but that big, silver shiny nickle seemed very important.  
Oddly enough, we switched to a $X.90 drink special on some happy hours and fewer people would ask for their change than on the $X.95 nights.  Some thought it was because the dime was smaller.  Other suggested a hatred for Roosevelt (it was a red state, lol).  
My personal opinion was that the $X.95 specials were generally for mixed drinks and the $X.90 specials were for beer (generally draft beer).  
Beer drinkers tend to leave coins and mixed drink customers ask for their change.
I don't work behind a bar, but my friend does. We work at this restaurant place with a killer bar section and during the same shift. One night this old guy sat on the bar stood and began ordering pints of Guinness. He downed them fairly quickly, yet refused to let her take the empty glasses. But after about 6 or 7, he began to chat my friend up. She, being reasonably attractive and of sound mind, told him that she wasn't interested. He continued to pester her while she worked, chatting her up and asking her to pass salt, glass, whatever it took for her to keep coming back to his side of the bar. The other waiting staffers tried to get his attention so that he would leave my friend alone, but he ignored them. If anything, he pestered her even more. Eventually she got annoyed and went out back to tell me about this old bastard. I told her that we can't do anything on our own, but I can go get the manager to keep an eye on him. By the time the manager arrived, it was 12:15 AM and we couldn't close the bar section because the guy was still there with 15 or so empty glasses spread across the counter top. When confronted by my manager, he got angry and refused to pay the bill until he got my friend's number. My manager finally said: "Look. If you don't stop this I'll be forced to call the police and charge you with public disturbance and the like." He piped down, slurred my friend to charge the bill to his room, and staggered back.
** Glass-hogging, general douchebaggery** 
My girlfriend is a bartender so i will help shed some light on what she has on her mind when she gets home:
* Bartenders are very busy doing more than just serving you.  If your bartender walks up to where you are sitting, dont keep having side conversations and make them wait.  ORDER YOUR DRINKS.
* Don't ask for one thing at a time (beer first, then a menu, then a lime, then order) everytime they come back to you.  Wait patiently.  They know you are there and they want your money.  Making other people wait because you are being a douche about getting what you want before anyone else can cost them major tips. 
* If you want good service and to be taken care of, tip well!! No bartender is going to bust their ass to serve you if you leave them a dollar on 3-4 pours.  If you tip after every beer instead of waiting for the tab at the end of the night, you will get better service.
* The food and alcohol choices are not those of the bartender.  Don't give them shit if you do not like the selection, or are unhappy with how it was cooked.  You watched them running behind the bar making drinks. How did they screw up how your fries were cooked?
 These are some of the many things i've heard from her.  Simply stated, use the golden rule.  Dont be a dick, and be patient.  If you are a regular and arent a douche you will get stiffer drinks, and sometimes a freebie plus more dedicated service for your needs.

&gt; If God exists science has to be able to observe him. Why do some scientists believe this is not so?
That is not true at all. Your statement is only true if God exists inside the closed system which is our universe. What a typical christian scientist (which is not an oxymoron, by the way) would say is that the singularity from whence the universe came was created, placed, and set off by God. Therefore God is outside of our universe. 
If God is outside of our universe, then there is literally no way to collect any scientific data about him because we cannot even speculate about what conditions would be like outside of the universe. Literally nothing we know even applies there.
Put it to you this way. Let's say God doesn't exist, and the notion of Him has never come up in the history of human existence, your perfect world. Speculate about something that exists outside of our universe. 
Speculate about another universe.
You can't. You don't even know where to begin. What if gravity didn't exist in another realm? What about time? What about the strong nuclear force? What about atoms? 
Science does not have to be able to observe God for him to exist, as science only deals with the known universe and the things therein. Christians believe God exists outside of our universe. Therefore, it is possible for a true scientist to still believe in God.
Don't bother thinking about this too hard. People just play with words and make stuff up to try and convince themselves and others that they are right. 
people say what they need to in order to reinforce what they want to believe
I was terrified of my first experience with sleep paralysis until I looked it up. Mine was similar to yours because of the spirit but apparently that is rather common when experiencing sleep paralysis. Also there were several layers of dreaming which is crazy and impossible for me to grasp at the time.
Here's my story (it's kind of long):
I was dreaming. I used to practice lucid dreaming frequently so I have a lot of experience recognizing I'm dreaming. My dream started with me at my friend's house. I started to get the feeling that I was dreaming because the layout seemed wrong. I went into his room looking for him. He wasn't there. Instead I got a really weird feeling that there was some sort of presence in the room. I sensed, for whatever reason, that the presence intended harm. I frantically started searching under the bed, in the closet, etc. to find something. Nothing was there but I felt really weird and, recognizing I was dreaming, decided to wake my self up (which I do all the time by clenching my eyes and fists and sort of willing myself awake).
So I awake in my bed in my room at my parents house (where I was at the time living). I look around still feeling that odd feeling. Everything in my room is exactly how it should be: layout, posters, furniture, etc. Except I notice an odd radio on my night stand. The radio starts out with a static noise and I once again start to freak out a little. Then there is a mixture of odd political rally speech and even some in foreign languages (I only speak English). After a few seconds of that a black, mist-like figure comes out of the speaker and hovers above my bed. Since I had just been dreaming and woke myself up (or so I had thought) I started sincerely freaking out. I tried to wake myself up. I couldn't (I had never before and never since been unable to wake myself up), so naturally there was a part of me that thought it was real. The spirit used some sort of force to paralyze me. It then began levitating my frozen body up out of the bed towards its position on the ceiling. Terrified, sweating, and bewildered I asked it what was happening. It's only response was "Get out, young one. Get out" which it repeated in a raspy voice several times. I finally said "This can't be real" and it responded "it issss". Freaking out I said "prove it to me". It paused for a second and I started to repeat that I wanted proof. I was interrupted by it saying "I am proving it". By now I am in an absolute state of horror. I close my eyes and tighten all my muscles and with all my strength try to wake up. I am released and fall to the bed and immediately when I hit the bed I wake up.
Everything is back to normal. No radio, no spirit. I run downstairs to see if anyone's awake and to get away from that room. As I'm going down the stairs I see my parents. I looked up at the stairwell towards the room to see if anything was following me. When I looked back at my parents I realize it is now my friend and his sister and I am no longer in my home but in the friend's house I originally began the dream in. I tell myself there is no way this can be happening, struggle to wake up again and finally, after waking up a third time...I am actually awake. I moved out of that room and I still won't go in there fully aware by now (three years later) that what I experienced was sleep paralysis. 
3 dream layers and an evil spirit who immobilized me and warned me of dangers.
I haven't read any LotR and only saw I think 2 of the movies a while ago. Meh. Not my favorite.
I can connect way more with Harry Potter because I never felt like I fit in in this muggle world either. I've always wanted to find out that I don't belong here, and be taken away to a whole new, magical place. Some place I will fit in. That's what makes HP better than LotR. People can relate on a lot of different levels.
I also grew up with HP. When I was 13, so was Harry. Again, a whole generation can completely relate with that. And what Harry and the gang feel is real. They go through real life crap in a magical world. Their emotions, they have fights with friends, they go through relationship issues. It's all there. 
 Jo Rowling did a fantastic job of capturing life in a magical setting, which makes the series number 1.
DOMS is caused by micro-tears in your muscle. You gain muscle size by feeding yourself enough protein so that your body repairs those micro-tears.
Basically, if you are working out a muscle that is experiencing DOMS, it hasn't repaired your last amount of micro-tears. If it hasn't repaired your last micro-tears, then you won't be able to push yourself as far, and also wont get as much micro-tears. 
Top Bodybuilders still work out the same muscle group 5-6 times a week, so it still works.
**** You can still lift and it will not cause atrophy. You won't get as much gains per workout as if you let it fully recover, but also you'll have less workouts per week.
Had to overcome my addiction to food. A lifelong issue, and something that had buried itself amidst depression/anxiety/etc.
I read the Beck Diet Solution, put some of the thoughts into practice, and was ready to embrace changing my life in regards to how I eat.
I mean, I could go into a long-winded explanation of how low I actually got mentally before I had enough, but it's long and depressing.
The positive of it all is this: I am making the changes, and once I no longer saw food as a means to cure your problems or make you happy (protip: it doesn't), then I was able to move forward and so far my progress has been fantastic, healthy, and most of all: sustainable. 
But, version? I had to change my thought process towards food, that's it. 
Pretty much this for me. I am only 4 days in and I have tried out My Fitness Pal and Noom, I think I am preferring Noom as it does not want you to record exactly what you eat and I don't want to obsessively track calories. 
Noom gives you a really good idea of what you are having and the whole process of recording what you eat makes you conscious of what you are actually having rather than just mindlessly eating.
I think even just keeping a basic food diary would help so you actually realise what you are having. Obviously there is also some willpower.
Record what you eat in some form, it will make you more conscious of what you put in your mouth and think as to whether you really are hungry.
The kitchen, in my house, is the center of our home, where we tend to congregate, talk, watch the news, read, and (of course) eat.  If I'm in the kitchen, I want to eat, even if I'm only there to sit down and read.  So I've started trying to consciously getting myself out of the kitchen and away from food. You may want to try "relocating" yourself to a part of the house where you normally don't eat when you're done eating your portion.
I used to have a cigarette when I was done eating.  It was my brain's indicator that we were done with food for now.  Then I quit smoking, and didn't know when to stop eating anymore.  To remedy this, I started taking a leisurely walk with my dog after dinner.  I'm trying to train my brain to say "hey, you're full, don't you want to walk now?" instead of "don't you want to smoke now?"  Plus, my dog gets psyched for it and that motivates me.  
 get up and walk away when you're done eating.  Don't hang out in the kitchen.
There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a young parent or an old parent. For my part, I want to be an old parent, partly because of the career path I've chosen and partly because I had an older mother (38) and a younger father (25) and I always got along better with my mother. I always felt like Dad wasn't quite ready for kids when we were little, but had to get ready because of Mom's age when they got married. She was 41 when my brother was born, and for both of us she's always had plenty of energy. When we were kids, she played with us all day all summer long since she was a teacher, and when we were older she never missed a game or performance. But then, she was always in pretty good shape and had generally taken care of herself her whole life. 
It was also kind of cool having a parent who had been to Beatles concerts and war protests and kind of had a been there, made that mistake attitude about the crap we got into. Not to say we got away with things because she was old because we didn't, but she always had a milder reaction to things like my brother eating a bug or me putting a nail through my foot or both of us tracking mud and snow in the house. And it's not like she had any older kids, either. She was just a very mellow parent from the beginning.
I'm also not terribly worried about my fertility or my parents becoming grandparents, mostly because of our family history. I still have 3 grandparents, ages 72, 72, and 90, and two great-grandparents, ages 92 and 94. All of them are still lucid and all but the 94 year old live in their own homes and all of them have been active parts of my life. I would never want to deprive my children of that, but I can also count on my parents likely living to a ripe old age. Along the same lines, my mom was fertile into her 40's, as was her mother and my paternal great-grandmother. Come to think of it, all 4 of my great-grandmothers had children into their 40's, and all of them lived to be at least 80, with two of them getting to their 90's.
*** All families are different, and what you do is dependent on what you know of your family history, your health, and your experiences, and no one should judge you for that or judge me for waiting til I approach that dangerous age of 35, because unless you know exactly all the details if the situation you're talking about, you don't get to judge their well thought out decisions.
Fear 3 has little to no scares and gameplay is OK. PLaying as fettel is pretty fun but its obvious they went for a more multiplayer oriented game. I bought fear 3 on release and i should have wated for it to go on sale, not worth 60, but worth 30 IMO. I had a lot of fun playing it, its still a really solid shooter, just less story and scares than the previous 2.
For sure worth $8 imo, played it once regualrly, then again as fettel. Its also a LOT more fun with a friend. Messing around as fettel is pretty sweet.
not what i expected, still pretty decent.
Translate it, then I'd prefer to see a shortened " version
About a year ago i had a bad trip on mushrooms (bad does not nearly come close to describe this). It started off like any other trip I've had with giggling and having fun with my trip buddies. We started to watch Toy Story 3 and thats when it went wrong.  I got a weird feeling that was eating away at me and my thoughts.  I was going psychotic in my head and all of the beautiful colors turned into pixels and faded to a dull and greyish color.  I couldn't take it anymore so I told my friends that i didn't feel well and went up to my room to sleep (horrible choice, don't be alone on mushrooms). I went up to my room and i don't know if I was dreaming or what but reality collapsed around me.  In my room alone i could here this strange chatter of multiple conversations all around my head that got to point where they were screaming in my ear.  I couldn't take it anymore so i sat up and yelled out "Who's there, get out of my room." It seemed to help me telling the voices off like that but it was just getting started.  I laid back down and started to feel better until i started hearing the sound of a woman crying and after hearing it for so long and realizing it was the sound of MY mother crying i got really freaked out and must have passed out or something because the next part was unreal I thought i was overdosing on some crazy drug that made me melt from the inside out I was puking and shitting all over myself while still hearing this horrible weeping noise until i realized i was in a coffin at a wake and people were all around me crying(that explains the conversations i was hearing so i must have been asleep the whole time).  I woke up around 430 in the morning completely drenched in sweat with my heart pounding realizing that i was alive and just had a bad trip i was relieved that my sanity had been restored and i was alright.  I told no one about my experiences that night and it still gives me chills when i think about that crying i was hearing. I went through a state of depression for a couple months but slowly creeped back into my normal state of mind.  That was the last time I've tripped and plan to one more time.. I can not end the way that i did.
Tripped on mushrooms had a bad trip, screwed with my head for a while, worst 4 hours of my life.
Seeing my "Archaeologist" character mining down a stone ruin. I/She dug down until I found an old, dusty version of my room. The tone of this dream was happy, about discovery. I was looking for something (gold?).
I saw the wardrobe and went to open it. Instead of gold, a mummified old woman was there. She then proceeded to fall INTO me, kind of like I was being possessed. A voice kind of echoed saying "She knew what she was going to find" (I'm a straight male) 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO FIND.
Also, the time I was chased by a Giant bee at my Primary (Elementary) School.
**A mummified grandma possessed me**
Once, ten years ago, I noticed a can of cheap, generic brand orange soda had been in my work fridge, un-drunk, for weeks. On one incredibly hot day (summer in Sydney, AU in a building with no AC) I thought, "fuck it", went into the kitchen and chugged the can as fast as I could before anyone came in and caught me drinking someone else's soda. I hid the empty can underneath some other trash in the trash can. The perfect crime. 
As I sat back at my desk, I thought about how refreshing the soda was and thought to myself; "who would buy that cheap orange soda in this office? Only person I know who would buy it is... my... Mum"
It was then I realised; it was my soda. I brought it in and forgot about it weeks ago. 
I unknowingly stole my own soda from the office fridge. 
That'd actually be a very easy defense. OP wanted to try a new "purge diet". Maybe it's not the most healthy choice, but he's been trying to lose weight for ages!
OP didn't like the taste of straight ipecac, so he figured he'd put some in his Pepsi and see how that worked for him. He could drink it right after eating his lunch. It also gave the added benefit that he'd enjoy the Pepsi on the way down and the way back up!
Unfortunately, Mr. [Thief] stole OP's Pepsi before OP could drink it and ingested the ipepsicac.
*** - You should not be a lawyer.
All of those are fully viable, Craigslist as well. (if you don't feel like driving around from pawn shop to music shop and vice versa) I scored my NS7FX brand new off Craigslist with it's flightcase and tons of extra bits for $800

Just yesterday I scored a set of needles+cartridges on ebay for my TT's for $8.43 (Stanton Skratchmaster V3 set). 
 eBay and Craigslist are amazing for deals.
On the other hand, if you ride enough neighborhoods on bike, you can tell that there is a very different character to the drivers in different areas. The quality of the roads is a confounding factor (the prevalence of protected bike lanes, etc), but if you just look at it on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis, the trend is there. Since the neighborhoods often break down along ethnic lines, it's easy to slip take the two sets of correlations (driving habits vs. neighborhoods vs. ethnicities) and create a syllogism that may or may not hold for the larger population.
 The jewish women in his neighborhood might be worse drivers around bikes than jews elsewhere.
You can either run, sen triplets to splash black, which is good if you want to use tezzert agent of bolas or splash green and run Rafiq the Many. I advise you to use Rafiq and run heavy hexproof creature as I can assure you, your opponents are going to kill your creature so you only have a board of equipments.
 I run a Rafiq the Many equipment deck, you need Hexproof to survive.
I would like to see some official DLC from Bethesda that accomplished this. Put a 'Canon Opening' option in the menu (for those who prefer the OG story) and then add a few different openings, fully voice-acted and have implications on the entire story. The mod that I know of offers this to a degree, but I would really like to see a fleshed-out, beefy Origins style DLC. 
- Start in the DB, middle of an assassination with Jeezara outside of Helgen. As you near the target, perhaps in a fort, Alduin drops down and confronts you; spooking the target, blowing your cover and forcing you to flee as the fort's forces begin their violent rebuttal against Alduin.
- Start in the Thieves Guild, similar to the Oblivion opening, rotting in the Helgen jail when Alduin attacks, the wall next to you gives way as he destroys portions of Helgen and you have to escape and survive the trip back to Riften on foot. Brynjolf, Vex and Delvin show up to aid in your escape.
- Companions. Start as a werewolf locked up in the bowels of a Silver Hand outpost when all of a sudden Vilkas and Farkas come...
Etc. etc. just with better writing by smarter people that actually know what they're doing. (Not a dig at the currently available mod, I am sure it's great - I'm referring to my slip-shod ideas in the post)
Assassin, Thief, Werewolf, people that don't suck at ideas and writing
Fair question. Let me amend my original post by saying that ultimately, brains turn me on. And i'm not even talking about book smarts- but the ability to understand life, to have some critical thinking, a love for the aesthetic (art, architecture, music, etc...) and an appreciation of things sensual and sublime. So someone could be incredibly delicious eye-candy but if they don't have the brains, personality and kindness to back it up, then she can't hold my interest. **TL/DR:** Yes, i appreciate what she has to say if it's worth appreciating. 
Prima facie an action taken in your own interest is not altruistic. In addition to the existing philosophical thought on this you might want to consider some evolutionary ethics - in that altruism may have a lot to do with perceived benefits/genetic similarity - maybe check out Levitts work on genetic altruism...
If you wanna talk about ethics it has to be on a scale - nothing is ever properly explained by a single category. 
The point being that you can be more or less selfish and more or less altruistic in roughly equal or vastly unbalanced portions.
In light of the - everything is selfish - line of argument I think the correct understanding of the situation is that selfishness and altruism are essentially competing drives - when you have one dominant (being selfish) then you *might* be acting unethically.
- Yes. Altruism and selfishness are compatible.
EDIT: OP - A priori is the wrong term to use in reference to a factual scenario that you can learn about - a priori in this case would mean that the knowledge of your benefit could be reached without considering any evidence. i.e. your selfishness would be logically necessary, which introduces a dissonance into your question. 
Since no one is really giving serious advice so far, I feel like I have to try to help you out the best I can. 
Respect her and her boyfriend.  You can't break them apart.  If you try and she finds out you tried to screw up their relationship, you will probably not talk to her again.  If you simply just be there for her and be a good person, hopefully she will eventually come around and it might work out between you to.
  Not much you can do really.  Just be yourself and don't try anything stupid and hope it works out.
Over the course of the last 30 years, the world economy has become even more tightly integrated.  One of the most underrated inventions with dramatic impact on the world is the [cargo container](  This allowed manufacturing to be done around the world and shipped within a reasonable time frame to the consumers.  With improved telecommunication technology, like the Internet, this has further reduced the division between us and the world.
Prior to the 1970s, US manufacturing benefited from the fact that we were physically isolated from the rest of the world by two oceans.  It was not to produce elsewhere to ship to the US nor was it easy to produce in the US to ship elsewhere.  In addition, post-WWII, the rest of the world was too busy rebuilding their basic infrastructure while the US had all the advantages of an unscathed manufacturing industry that was primed by the war manufacturing.
With the advent of containerization and countries that are producing, we are now facing our first real competition in over 70 years.  For much of this generation's manufacturing, we've never had to encounter anything like this.
What this means to manufacturing and industries is that companies are no longer limited to operating within one geographical border.  With transportation costs at minimum, a company can sell to multiple markets and multiple consumers.  In addition, their manufacturing supply is much greater.  This means that companies do not look upon a given market in isolation but as a collective.  If we take a look at the world as an unified whole, the US middle class is far richer than the median middle class of the world.  It really is not sustainable.  This "elimination of the middle class" that we often hear about is fundamentally a reversion to the mean.  
What this also means is that the upper and lower class of the US gets pushed to the extremes.  The CEO of a multi-national has significantly more responsibilities and generates much more value than when the company only operated within the US.  His salary and wealth reflects this increase demand.  
So, you bring up the point that we should increase the wages of manual labor so that they can become consumers.  Fortunately or unfortunately corporations already do do that.  Corporations are increasing the wealth of the Chinese laborers and the Chinese middle class because the developing nation economies have a much greater demand for consumption than our already developed western economy.  A corporation does not care whether the consumption is coming from US or China or Ethiopia.  If the growth rate is significantly higher in one of those countries, they have a fiduciary duty to supply it.  
If you look at any recent reports, the growth rate of the [Chinese middle class]( is unprecedented.  It surpasses even the growth rate of the Post-WWII US economy.  (The current estimates for the size of the Chinese middle class (300M) is approximately the size of the entire population of the US with estimates of the Chinese middle class growing to over 800M.)
In canonical terms, within your neighborhood, what percentage of them are buying a new washing machine or a TV or a dishwasher?  The answer is very small percent.  In China, you have an entire generation of people that are just entering the middle class and purchasing these luxuries.  This makes China an extremely lucrative market for any manufacturer to supply.  In addition, by growing the Chinese middle class, we make even more consumers of these goods.  In comparison, in the US, much of the lower and middle class are not in the market for these durable goods.
In another comment on another thread, I asked, "Why should a multinational company that sells to a foreign consumer be beholden to US laborer?"  In other words, why should a company, like GE, that sells durable goods to China and India be morally or ethically obligated to hire US laborers?  For a multinational, what does it mean to be a "US company?"  If we decide that GE has a moral or ethical obligation to hire US laborers, they would not be able to compete with the Chinese companies that have lower cost of living and lower wage costs.  This basically means that in 10 years, instead of buying our appliances from GE, we will be buying it from Qingdao Haier.
So, I've presented the "problem" that we face with US manufacturing, labor, and middle class.  Let's talk about solutions.
The solution is the same solution that China has embarked on in the last 15 years: move up the production value chain.  Over the course of the last 60 years, we've been able to monopolize the production value chain without much effort.  Over the course of the last 30 years, China has been slowly eating away at the production value chain, first with low skill, low value work and now moving into high skilled and high tech work.  Years ago, "Made in China" were only seen on plastic toys and cheap products.  Now, the bulk of high tech devices, like your iPhone or laptop, has the label "Made in China".  Each and every year, they are inching their way up their production value chain.  There is already a burgeoning industry in technology and software development in China.  As they move up the production value chain, they are losing and/or giving up their low value production to other developing countries like Vietnam or Thailand.
The same needs to happen in the US.  Fighting to grasp the bottom of the production value chain is a losing proposition.  As I said in my original comment on this thread, the original article, while feel-good, is not sustainable.  The value of manufacturing a coffee mug is not all that high.  We provide no competitive advantage over out competitors in holding onto these low value industries.  On the other extreme, the high production value technology industry is dominated by the US.  We need to ensure that we continually grow this industry.  This makes highly technical education even more important in the US.
Unfortunately, for those that are undereducated for the tech industry, they will miss out on the new economy.  The other growth industry in the US is the service industry.  There will be even greater demand for people to provide services that cannot be exported, such as healthcare/home care services, restaurant services, or personal services.
The recession of 2008 is not just another cyclical recession; it was the symptom of the systemic shift that has been occurring in the last 25 years.  This is why we have so many on long-term unemployment.  Far too many people are out waiting for their jobs to come back, but the world and the economy has changed.  Those jobs are gone and we need to be prepared for the new economy.
With the practical elimination of geographical limitations, we do ourselves a great disservice to look at the US in isolation.  We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple decades of prosperity without limitations, but that is slowly coming to an end.  The best of the US will be amongst the best in the world and the worst in the US will be amongst the worst of the developed nations and the middle will fall somewhere between.
***:  We are in the throes of a global economical shift where economies are more tightly integrated and labor is in greater competition. 
I'll just add one that I haven't seen posted. China gives me chance after chance to stand up for myself. Living in America, I've had very few experiences of getting screwed or just plain inconvenienced by other people. Whether willfully or not, it happens quite often in China. Anything from getting my salary unjustifiably cut short by my company (allowing me an opportunity to address the injustice) to getting cut in line at the convenience store (allowing me to chew someone out and get real on their ass), at so many different points has my persistance been tested. 
In the end, China has helped me learn how to not take shit from others. And it's not only that I encounter more of these situations in China than the US, but it's also that so very often I'll see my Chinese friends sticking up for themselves... not a single time have I seen my friends be walked upon, and that's helped curb my incessant over-politeness and agreeability in contentious situations. 
Chinese people and circumstances have helped me learn how to stand up for myself.
In some ways, I'm very hopeful. Henry Cavill as Superman is something I've wanted to happen since about 2004 so it's great. And Michael Shannon is an excellent actor. 
I'm certainly iffy about a few things though. Superman has two absolutely key people in his life who help define who and what he is: Lois and Lex. Amy Adams is a good actress, no doubt. I'm unsure if she can portray Lois Lane well enough, but that's something I can complain about or praise after seeing a trailer. But Lex isn't even in the movie. At least, not in any major role that we know of. Lex is more than a villain for Superman, he's a supporting character. That's one thing that Smallville got right (during the first 3 seasons) even though it got Clark and his journey pretty wrong.
I'm also iffy about the costume and what it means. See, the no-trunks look bothers me because it just continues the pattern of DC constantly remaking Superman to appeal to apologists and haters. People who complain about Superman being "too good" or "too powerful" are often the same people bashing his trunks and his disguise. His trunks are iconic, dammit. The new suit doesn't balance the colors well enough. And, from the set pictures that have surfaced online, Clark doesn't wear his glasses either. The glasses? Also iconic.
And, of course, I'm worried about the story. I love what Chris Nolan and David Goyer have done with their Batman franchise. However, I also recognize that their Batman is very far removed from comic book Batman. Nolan's Batman is a guy with high intelligence, great fighting skills, and a whole bunch of gadgets. Comic book Batman is a hyper-prepared, olympian super-genius. 
I'm worried that the new movie won't capture the "fun" and "hope" that is representative of [good] Superman comics. I hope it ends up being more *Birthright* than John Byrne's *Man of Steel.*
 Cautiously optimistic.
I assume your boss already owned a perfectly capable computer/smartphone before he got his iPad. From my own personal experience, the people who go out and splash unnecessary amounts of money on an iPad usually have the mentality of "ooh, shiny" and don't care to learn how anything works. I know one person personally who owns an iPad, she got it when she was 13. I asked an apple forum why anyone would get an iPad and found two mentalities there: People who, like myself, had no problem with Apple but couldn't justify spending that much money for a tablet; and people who kept spouting on about "ease of use" and "innovation" - basically they were parroting back any buzzwords they could remember from Apple's first key note speech in which they unveiled the iPad (this was years ago).
 Your boss's actions do not surprise me, not one bit.
I think making blanket statements about what people want is always going to be a mistake, especially when it comes to literary fiction. 
With a great swath of staggeringly different fiction out there for everyone to enjoy, there is someone out there for everyone. I loved the Magicians and though I do not believe all books should be like it I'm glad it exists.
I tend to relish a focus on realism, especially in a fantasy world. I respect your opinion but it seems to me what you are arguing is a matter of taste, not a matter of fact. 
When narrative fiction focuses on realism I say "Ooh, how fun."
very well put. the reason i mainly stay with tri-force is for the kiting and sustain that it gives him (Q proc sheen and slow from phage, auto, w, auto, q, auto etc). I usually don't mess around with PD because you alreay get the built in AS with tri-force, plus if you're hitting your Q's and initiate with ult, passive gives plenty of AS. I agree with you on the infinity edge though for sure, nothing makes an AD output quite like an IE. 
I guess I just like to play him purely for his zone/kite abilities rather than using him as a straight up duelist. Seems like people who play him wanting super deeps go the PD/IE/LW route which serves their purpose well, though IMO, the sheen phage is to much utility to ignore on a great kite like ezreal. Cheers man!
 heavy deeps late game is what you're going for with IE/PD/etc. For kiting though, I feel tr-force is needed.
This article is written criticizing target and provides only one incident of the false advertising *allegedly* happening. Oh, and we have no way to back up the claim of the consumer that accidental damage was covered. What possible reason would they make this up? A free IPod is a plausible reason. 
Anyone with any skepticism won't accept this article at face value. If the article had any shred of proof other than one person's word, it could work. Hell, I'd settle for multiple similar accounts from different customers. But not, that's asking too much.
**TL:DR: Alleged consumer allegedly alleges... fuck it, target is bad.** 
This sort of freedom of conscience being applied to doctors is acceptable in my mind IF AND ONLY IF
1. When being hired, the doctors must be required to disclose any and all legitimate medical practices they cannot in good conscience perform, and 
2. The hospitals have every right to base their hiring decisions upon the candidates response to 1. If a doctors religion will affect his / her performance on the job then it absolutely must be a fair consideration. 
I'm alright with a doctor who will refuse to perform some procedure for moral reasons, so long as they are never needed to. Going back to the story where the doctor who refused to treat the rape victim in Oklahoma a while back; the doctor should have every right to refuse to do any services he desires, so long as the hospital doesn't put him in the position where a patients well being relies on him to do so. He should never have been the doctor on call if he wouldn't be willing to perform the duties the position requires. If he has every right to claim his religion as a reason to withhold service, then the hospital should be OBLIGATED to ensure he's never the doctor relied upon to perform that service. And, these objections need to be voiced before he is offered the position.
 It's not religious discrimination if your job performance relies on it, and these doctors shouldn't be relied upon to do so
Right. Yeah, that is generally what happens in the United States. The only times suicides are reported are when they are like, Kurt Cobain. Then, it's only because he was a cultural icon. Speaking as someone who has had a few friends and family members commit suicide, the obituary is really the only thing that is published and that is at the hands of the family, and they usually don't say it was suicide because, frankly, they usually don't believe that their loved one killed themselves. They want to believe it was murder or an accident, and sometimes self inflicted deaths genuinely are accidents, ESPECIALLY among drug users and particularly among opiate/opioid addicts who also take a benzodiazepine or several benzos. 
Case and point, Heath Ledger died by his own hand but it wasn't suicide(although some people have speculated it was), this is something I can speak to myself, as someone who has had some pretty serious prescription drug abuse issues(with literally all of the drugs he overdosed on, which includes "oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, and alprazolam" according to the toxicology report performed as part of his autopsy). In cases of high profile deaths, the media is going to report it, and eventually the cause of death is going to be released somehow, perhaps the family releases information as a way to send a message to folks struggling with addiction or depression to get help, or because in this day and age, people are more concerned with getting paid or getting their 15 minutes of fame for breaking some story of a celebrity death than they are with how the family and friends of the deceased are treated by reporters and the information is "leaked".
 I mean, I can only imagine going to my son, father, cousin, nephew, wife, daughter, girlfriend, sister, or any funeral, you know, of someone that I loved and having a huge crowd of people I have to basically push and shove as I'm bombarded with really inappropriate questions(considering that the media ACTS all sad and caring as they sit in the press tent covering the funeral live, when really, they are showing what kind of scum they really are, remember the Whitney Houston funeral where they asked questions about the service to people as they left the funeral? That was so shitty of them to do and really made me start questioning the integrity of not just American media but of the WORLDS media, and that whole phone hacking scandal shows it isn't just the American media who are FUBAR).
As someone who has overdosed on opiates(once on methadone and once on oxymorphone) and by overdose I mean a real overdose where I am absolutely certain I would have died if not for the fact that an ambulance was called because I was cyanotic(cyanosis is when you aren't breathing and turn blue as a result, completely unresponsive, and without naloxone, basically dead) twice, I have seen the result of my terrible decisions and how those decisions hurt my family...particularly my mom, who on both occasions, was the one who found me, and on my dad, who on both occasions, was the one who performed CPR...I just can't imagine if I was famous and my mom and dad had to answer questions that they don't need to face on what is possibly the worst day of their life(the day of my hypothetical funeral as a result of one of my previous OD's) , questions like "DID YOUR SON COMMIT SUICIDE?", "DID YOU KNOW YOUR SON WAS A DRUG ADDICT?", "WHY DID HE DO THIS? WE WERE FANS, WE WERE COWORKERS MAKING MONEY TOGETHER, HOW COULD HE LEAAAVE US, EVEN FROM THE GRAVE WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO EXPLOIT HIM, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW WE COULD DO THAT? MAYBE HAVE A RED CARPET FUNERAL AND ASK THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS?", I mean just imagine that, I know my addiction is my fault, and having lived through an overdose, I know what the families went through, I've seen it, imagine the world making a media spectacle of your death or your moms death...it's just fucking terrible.
So luckily, in cases of true, 100% certain cases of suicide, the person has to be pretty famous or notorious to get media attention(the lucky part meaning that the media doesn't cover many cases as a suicide because the investigators don't tell the media it even was a suicide to avoid copy cats, unfortunately people who commit suicide and who are famous tend to have fans and after their death, a lot more fans, and a lot of those fans can be quite ill and may harm themselves). Mostly, the only media attention self inflicted deaths, accidental or intentional, receive is in the obituary.

And I know your comment really didn't need a response like this but I just needed to get these feelings off my chest,
FUCK THE MEDIA FOR BEING MEAN TO FOLKS WHILE THEY ARE VULNERABLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS LAST BIT IS IN CAPS. THE KEY IS STUCK.  
Sorry for taking so long to reply to this, been at work and then out drinking (so this response is posted in a somewhat drunken state where I take no responsibility for any factual or grammatical errors).
Seeing as I cannot find any crime under article II of the original [treaty]( between the US and Sweden which would cover WikiLeaks release of classified documents, I don't really see how an extradition request would at all be possible, according to the treaty? Further, article V.2 fotbids extradition in cases where the requesting state regards the crime as political. The US would probably circumvent article V.2 though.
Article VI(b) of the [supplementary treaty]( which concerns temporarily surrendering a suspect, refers this to an *extradition request*, i.e. a crime which falls under article II, mentioned above.
- I can't even see how Assange would qualify for a temporary "loan" to the US. I am drunk though so I might be wrong.
Are there other people who are scared of the current situation between politics and the internet? I have this bad feeling that we might be entering a pre-phase of civil war (worst case). 
On the one hand, there are many people who want to have a censorship free internet. On the other hand, there are people, mostly those with power, who want to see the internet censored. However, the later is a minority. 
Then we have the current internet, still relatively uncensored, allowing people to band together and form hacker groups (not talking about anonymous). These hacker groups only fight to bring forth the truth which governments try to hide. 
In the middle of this is Assange as the informal representative of the uncensored internet. Prosecution of Assange will ultimately provoke "truth fighters" and lead to serious attacks on government websites. Consequently, sensitive government information will be leaked, giving an actual reason for "quick measurements" from the governments. So the witch-hunt for hackers starts. 
Once in this phase, underground systems and safe-houses for hackers start to develop and the people of the internet will start public campaigns against government policies. There will be flash-mobs every day, demonstrating the power of a world united through the internet and our governments will be scared. So they can do two things: "Fight or give up."
If the governments give up, the internet becomes truly uncensored. However, and this is what I fear, if the government chooses to fight, a civil war will be inevitable. 
So I wonder if I am just imagining things or is fear is justified? 
** I am scared of a civil war over the internet.**
Can you make a TL:DR? I'm driving...
Long time lurker, had to make an account after reading this post!
For starters-big internet hugs to you, your Mum and your Dad. Alzheimers sucks some major balls, I'm so sorry to hear what you're all going through right now. Secondly, please protect your Nurse-right now, he/she is your only real link to the inside workings of the situation and without him/her, you wouldn't know half of what was going on. I learnt very quickly as a nursing student to keep my mouth shut-I would see things that had me crying all the way home and doubting my chosen profession but after documenting them and finally presenting them to my superiors, I went from a straight A model student to being labelled as a "troublemaker" and constantly having my work scrutinised and criticised. As I progressed through my career (a lot of it being in aged care/dementia/alzheimers), I struggled to accept the fact that a lot of my colleagues had "lost" all of their passion for the job to the point where they were treating humans like animals. It was not uncommon for a nurse to request that the Dr increase a difficult patients' meds  simply because they wanted a "break" (essentially turning the patient into a drugged-out zombie)-9 times out of 10, the Dr would do it patient unseen, taking the nurses' word for it. I noticed that you mentioned that your Dad seemed heavily medicated so this may be happening behind the scenes. This is something you will need to discuss directly with his treating physician-ask what meds your Dad is on (both scheduled &amp; PRN), the possible side effects and outline your concern for his current quality of life whilst on these meds-your Dad certainly doesn't deserve to be drugged to the eyeballs for the remainder of his life.
In my experience, dementia/alzheimers patients' behaviour always changes for a reason and most of the time is expressed unconventionally-whether it be infection, abuse, pain, perceived threat/fear etc. The fact that your Dad is covered in marks and staff are saying that he's "acting out" suggests to me that he IS in fact acting out or more accurately REacting to the abuse/abusers. It's a vicious cycle because that then gives the staff reason to heavily medicate him, label him as "difficult" and wipe their hands of the situation. A camera will obviously gather evidence after the event but in the meantime a good way to address this is simply by keeping a presence around your Dad-I know your Mum can't be there all the time but if you could maybe arrange for family/friends/charity/volunteer organisation to drop in regularly to read to him/do a craft activity/play a game or something then not only is it benefiting your Dad but they can keep an eye on things, the staff will know they're being watched and you've got yourself another credible witness/es who can submit an independent assessment of your Dad's behaviour in this setting that can dispute the staff's claims of him being difficult to handle.
My Grandmother suffered a massive stroke that left her completely paralysed down her left hand side and unable to talk. As a result, she was placed in a care facility that from the outside, looked great. A member of our family visited everyday so it wasn't long before we picked up on things like my Grandmother going unwashed/dressed for two days, not enough staff being rostered at meal times meaning she was going unfed and the final straw came when I had to search for a nurse for over 20 minutes after I found my Grandmother distressed, moaning and grimacing in pain and waited another 30 for them to administer her some  pain relief. My Aunt (also a nurse) and I expressed our dissatisfaction to the Director about things enough times for him to realise that unless he did something about it, all hell was going to break loose-I guess he didn't want to risk his accreditation &amp; funding by having things escalate by getting the authorities involved. He ended up hiring more staff and the standard of care increased dramatically however insufficient staffing levels are another reason why the standard of care in these places is so bad. I read that you've sought legal advice which is great, maybe you could also consider lodging an official complaint with the Director of the care facility or enquire as to their complaints handling process? 
- Protect your nurse, speak to your Dad's Dr, arrange for some regular "company" for your Dad &amp; give him a hug from me :)

   
&gt; They won't turn you in
That's right, and that's wrong. If you tell them about your urges, and how you feel, they cannot reveal that to anyone you don't give explicit permission to. 
HOWEVER!
If you say something, and they think you may be a danger to yourself, or anybody else, they are obligated to report that to the police, along with any *relevant* information they may need. (Note: Check your local ethics code that psychiatrists follow, and any mandatory reporting laws. They shouldn't be able to report something that happened in the past, but that is all up to the area you live in)
I know this, as when I was younger, my mom went on a trip, and I had the place to myself for a week. Before she went to the airport, she dropped my off at my therapist. My therapist said something that triggered memories of severe abuse from my father. Usually, I just break down and cry during those times. But the therapist kept pushing and pushing despite the fact I said I wasn't ready to confront those memories. She kept pushing and pushing. Eventually, I just went numb. I felt no emotion, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I just stood up, walked to the door, opened it, turned towards the psychiatrist and said "Don't worry, after this weekend my father will no longer be an issue in my life, or anyone elses". 
I left, and caught the bus to go home to get a weapon, and kill him. That was fully my intention, as at the time, I was apathetic to the consequences of my actions. I felt that by killing him, I would save another helpless child from being abused the way I was.
However, the bus ride home was pretty long. Just over an hour. During the time away from the psychiatrist, I started to regain my emotions. Regain my sense of self, and how no matter how evil my father was, I couldn't stoop to his level.
I got off at the last bus stop, which is usually where I would get off to go home. Instead of walking home, I walked 2 minutes in the opposite direction, and went to the RCMP station. I intended to finally, after many years, have my father charged with the abuse throughout the years. I was in an "interrogation" room for over an hour, answering questions. The officer excused himself, got up and left for a moment to check on something. He came back 20 minutes later with 3 officers, and they strip searched me to ensure I had no weapons, and put me in handcuffs, and took me to a youth mental health ward for an overnight examination (I was released the following morning). Never once did they ask if I wanted to continue with pressing charges. They ignored the fact that I did the responsible thing and went to an RCMP station to do what needed to be done to get closure instead of being violent and ending my fathers life. All they cared about was that the municipal police had issued a notice to urgently bring me in to the mental health ward for examination. To me, it felt like they didn't care about me, or what I went through.
I tried twice after that throughout the years to press charges against my father. The first time, the RCMP told me that I could only press charges in the province in which it *started*, despite it occurring throughout several provinces (5 to be exact). The second time, I contacted a legal advise line run by the provincial government. I explained why I wanted to press charges, and possibly get help as it was a sensitive issue. The cunt on the other end of the line told me to suck it up, and being abused as a male wasn't half as bad as being abused by a female. I said some things after that to her on the phone that, if I said it to anyone else I would feel ashamed. But to her? No. She belittled the abuse I went through, and made me feel worthless, all because I wasn't an abused female. I was in a mental health "clubhouse" at the time (Laing House in Halifax), and a few case workers had to pry the phone away from me and forcibly drag me into another room to calm me down. They didn't call the police, and for that, i'm grateful.
Now, before any of you start bashing police in response to me, please. Don't. I lost respect for the officers that I spoke with in regards to the abuse. I still have, and will continue to have, tremendous respect for the RCMP, and other provincial and municipal police. I'm not going to hold the actions of a few against the whole.
edit: - If you say you have urges, they won't do anything. If you say you are going to do something, and they think it's credibile, they have to report it.
Dude. Read the post. It's not that long. And your comment is not applicable to the case at hand.
 Read it you bum. 
Go ahead and vomit, but I feel like you're misunderstanding. 
I feel I speak for the majority of Reddit when I say pedophiles don't choose to be attracted to children; that would be a horrible existence. I don't think harshly of people because of what they're sexually attracted to, however, pedophilia is harmful to others in a similar way that rape is. It's sex without consent. Children generally don't have the capacity to understand sex, and many cases of "statutory rape" are actually rape. Force is used, or manipulation. 
People like the OP recognize that what they're doing is harmful before it directly affects anyone else, and choose to get help; these are the people we should pity, because their attraction is something morally impossible to act on. Generally, though, people hear the word "pedophile" and immediately assume the person's a child rapist, when in actuality most people attracted to children understand what a horrendous thing that would be and subsequently don't do it.
This is all in stark contrast to homosexuality, which harms no one, doesn't violate rules of consent, is just as morally correct as heterosexuality and cannot in any way be compared to pedophilia on any level other than something out of one's control.
if you compare pedophilia with homosexuality, you're gonna have a bad time.
There have been several studies, [this is one reported on by The Guardian.](  There isn't going to be an anonymous person on a message board, with or without proven credentials, that will be able to give a satisfactory answer.  Everyone has their own opinion on the matter which was developed very much the same way you suggest that a person "becomes a homosexual", through life experiences and events shaping that opinion.  I will however do my best to give a logical analysis.
Homosexuality has been a part of human nature, as well as presenting itself in wild animals, since damn near the beginning and so we must start at the root of homosexual bias: religion.  I know your eyes just got wide because I am about to discuss something personal for many people, believers and non-believers, but take a deep breath, I'll remain as multipartisan as possible.
Whether discussing the Bible, Qur'an, Tanakh, or any other scripture what we are discussing are early documents of political text about how one should live their lives.  When a religious text is introduced it is not immediately popularized, perhaps it gains a following among a base in the community, but many people already have their philosophies on life at this point and swaying the opinions of those with deep beliefs is not going to be simple.  A religion needs to be sustainable, and it needs to grow.  It is logical therefore that a religious text would condemn homosexuality, and prophylactics, so that more children are born and can be raised under these ideologies at the birth of a religion.  Having it being represented in the text is the best way to go about this.  
Rather than saying: "In order to live a respectable life, follow the teachings of this text, oh, and I know it doesn't say it in there, but don't have sex with other men.  And make a lot of babies.  I know, I know, it doesn't say that in there or anything but seriously, that's, I mean... Just don't do it, it's bad for people."  It is added into the text because it is far more powerful and far more likely that people will follow these directives.
Mormonism, a fairly modern religion, needed to grow rapidly in a world where many religions have already settled into society.  Allowing for multiple wives bearing children accomplishes this task, and also rests the burden of support on the man to justify the multiple partners, this is contracted through the marriages so that men don't tout their Mormonism as an excuse to womanize and abandon children.
Now, we're on Reddit, so you've seen the atheist argument that you need to take a religious text as a whole rather than cherry pick the things you agree with.  And we've all heard the response, "that was a different time, things have changed."  Now a witty atheist might say, "well I thought the bible was the word of God?  God didn't say not to follow those laws anymore, are you saying that people are more powerful than God?"  And they would be right.  But would I blow your mind if I told you both were correct?  The statements just have not been articulated properly.
Here's the thing.  Many religious texts have similarities, especially when discussing the afterlife, which are incentives and deterrents for doing things that are seen as good or bad respectively.  There are many opinions on what exactly the afterlife is like, so we'll just settle with there is something good for those who are good people, and there is something bad for those who are bad people.  Judaism is looser on this, stating that if the good you do over the course of your life outweighs that of the bad, you will be allowed into your paradise.  Other religions differ, some allow you to repent and be allowed in, some condemn you for your misdeeds.  But they are all saying the same thing.  Be a good person.
As time passes things change, a religious text might not allow for wearing garments made out of two different materials.  This might have been because thread was scarce at the time and certain materials needed to be used for things which are important to the survival of the  community such as bandaging.  A text might state that you may not mark a tattoo on your skin, this might have been simply a health matter because tattoos are highly susceptible to infection which would rapidly deteriorate the health of an individual during a time when medicine was not nearly as advanced as it is today.  But things have changed, thread is no longer scarce and there are many new varieties with which we can make material and alternatives have been found for the things we need.  Tattoos are not a life threatening risk because we have ointments and precautions to prevent infections.  The purpose for those words have therefore been fulfilled and "God's word" helped for the survival of people to the point where it is no longer a necessity.  So you see, the atheist is right in saying that you can't cherry pick from the scripture to tailor it to your feelings, it's all or nothing.  But the believer is correct as well, because they would follow that text had it's purpose not been fulfilled already, and this comes from a lack of familiarity with how their religion works within the society, and alongside other religions, not a lack of knowledge about their religion.  A small, but important difference.
Back to homosexuality.  There are hundreds of religions, many of them follow the same guidelines, in fact if we compared all of them next to each other where they differ would be a much shorter book, quickly and easily consumable, we could call this book McLigion.  What we see are similarities within them which are misunderstood and become hot button issues.  When more than one religious group agrees on something they get an overwhelming majority in the political arena and thus an oppression occurs.  Slavery, which was intended to help build societies, becomes a grotesque tool.  Who says a slave needs to be treated poorly?  Homosexuality being condemned nearly universally among religions is a misunderstanding of why homosexuality is condemned in the text, and as a religion ages it becomes further and further removed from the context of the time.  Religions that have a powerful voice have already been established, there is no longer any need to oppress homosexual tendencies because their voice in the world has been solidified and what happens is that they hit a point of diminishing returns.  A religious text might have helped the preservation of the human race, or a certain ethnicity, by making sure that a man and a woman laid together only for procreation, but now there are plenty of people in the world, of all races, creeds, and numbers of fingers.  Where the mental anguish of those conflicted about their feelings toward men or women might have been seen as an acceptable evil, we no longer need to lean on these rules for the preservation of humankind.
My point is, whether it is a choice, whether it is genetic, it does not matter.  People are who they are because of both genetics and life experience, it doesn't make them less of people, it doesn't make them less important, it doesn't make them less of anything.  They are great people, some people are annoying and flamboyant, some people are calm and reserved.  Neither of these qualities are exclusive to heterosexuals or homosexuals, they are qualities of people and that is what it comes down to.  When discussing gay marriage we aren't discussing whether it is proper for a homosexual couple to get married in the eyes of God.  We are discussing whether homosexuals are equal as people and whether homosexual love is anything less than heterosexual love and watching people stumble all over speeches about civil unions just makes me want to hit them on the head with Liberace (credit Aaron Sorkin with that last line, Matthew Perry, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip).  It's about society as a whole saying you're right, we are free people and everyone has a right to be happy and to be judged based on their character and not by a small aspect of a very, very, large life.
**- I... It's long, I understand if you didn't read it.  I just hope it's lucid enough to make sense.  It's a lot of material to condense into a Reddit post. If you're not interested in homosexuality in modern culture I'd just skip it, though you're probably the person that should be reading it.**
Try talking about terrorists with a rational person.  Talk about how some of them are falsely accused, and how this ruins their lives--talk about the no-fly list.  Try talking about how much money is spent hunting "terrorists" and that we're fighting an ill-defined problem.  Explain that some terrorists are simply misunderstood freedom fighters--I've seen those arguments float by on reddit from time to time.  You might not get agreement, but your argument might be heard.
Now, see how far in this argument you could get if the subject were pedophiles instead of terrorists.  Try explaining that we are spending too much money catching pedophiles.  Try saying we should punish them less harshly or that we should do away with a sex offender registry.  Try saying that they are merely misunderstood.
Pedophiles are _certainly_ hated more than terrorists.  They are hated to the point where we're willing to strip even their humanity from them.
  A terrorist might be called a freedom fighter; what else do you call a pedophile?
I work at a cafe and we were all out at a staff party. During a very drunk conversation my boss and coworker began arguing about who could bic (accidentally pocket) the most lighters. They kept going back and forth, my co worker accused my boss of not going out enough so not having enough exposure. My boss accused my co worker of being too nice and to always give them back, so they made a bet. 
Who could bic the most in a month, the winner has bragging rights, the loser has to shove a lighter up their ass. 
A month goes by, the final count is fifty four to fifty eight. My co worker lost, and on camera, stuffed in a condom, he put a lighter up his ass. 

boss and co worker had bet, resulted in co worker shoving a lighter up his ass.  
Do you use anything on your face to help your acne? When I stopped putting products on my face (like benzoyl peroxide or face soap) my acne gradually just went away completely in 2 months and my face is no longer oily. I didn't have light acne either. My acne was pretty moderate and maybe even borderlined severe on some days and now I hardly have any. 
 I am 17 years old now and I probably starting putting that stuff on my face when I was in 6th grade when I got my first pimples. I guess I outgrew the hormonal aspect for the most part and the stuff I was putting on my face was causing irritation and more acne. Feels good not to have to ever wash my face again or worry about more pimples.
**you might have acne because of products you use on your face**
There should be a setting to allow iPod Control or Audio Control. I have a Pioneer DEH-3200UB in my 98 Silverado. Normally, connecting it to the front USB port will make it lock out the device and control it only through the Head Unit. The iPhone will still work, but features like Music and Video show "Accessory Connected" or loading a Youtube video only shows the Video Out screen. 
It has a convenient button that allows you to switch control to the iDevice itself. For iPods, you can use the scroll wheel or the Music app. You can even play videos on the iPod Classic and the iPod Touch. For iPhones and iPod Touches, you can use the Music and Videos app on the phone, as well as load Youtube Videos and other apps like Pandora and such. While it shows video on the iPhone/iPod, all sound is delivered to the stereo via the dock connector. 
 check your stereo settings for a control feature that switches from head unit control to iPhone control. 
Owner of insomniac doesn't think he needs big artists to make EDC the experience he wants it to be. In reality it is probably just a move by the heaviest voice in EDM right now to try and lower big name DJ's prices and sway the scene to attend events with cheap, unknown DJs
Still 
Major businessman using weight to make money on EDM events anyway he can (nothing wrong with it that).
Can anyone give me the TLDR version?
It really depends on your setup/how much money you're willing to spend.  
The first thing I'll say is that logic wasn't designed to play live so you're better off going with software that was designed for performance. [Ableton]( [Traktor]( or [MLR]( are probably best for what you're looking to do. 
There are a bunch of different hardware controllers that you can choose from to launch samples ([APC]( [MPD]( [Launchpad]( [Monome]( [Livid's stuff]( etc.).  
As far as applying effects, you have two options: hardware or software.  If you want to use hardware effects on specific parts of your songs, you'll need an interface with multiple outputs ([NI Audio 6 or 10]( would work).  For software effects, you can pretty much just use any midi controller.  
 There isn't one ideal way to perform original tracks live.  Best thing is to look into Ableton, Traktor, MLR, or similar and figure out what works best for you.
Hope I could be of some help.  
I don't wear any. Mostly 'cause I don't have a proper uniform yet, but also because I think it's disrespectful to those who have earned them. I can understand if you're playing a milsim for a couple of days and want to wear "General" to show people you give the orders...  But otherwise: No. 
 You earn the badge, you wear it.
My dad gave me the old BDU's that he had when he was enlisted in the U.S. Army years ago, with the consent that i'd be using them for airsoft. I don't desecrate the memory of his by removing the patches, but I also don't flaunt them to others and I certainly don't take credit for them.
About flags as well, I figure that you aren't necessarily fighting for your country during airsoft, but your nation's flag on your kit isn't really going to upset anybody, it would in fact be a lot cooler if there were multiple nationalities of airsofters playing together, and they were reppin' the patches of their respected country. If I (an American) however, were to wear, say, a Russian flag simply because it looks cool, then that would be drawing the line. The line gets a little hazy with flags though, because it would be hard to get mad at somebody for wearing an Italian flag if they have Italian heritage.
 Don't take credit or flaunt the unit patches, and don't even put them on your kit if you haven't earned them. (Hypocritical, I know, seeing as I have a unit patch on my BDU jacket, but my father earned it while he was in the Army, so it would be disrespectful to him if I took it off of his jacket.)
I know there are many Riot employees who check Reddit and we should show them how much we appreciate their work. I'm not saying we aren't, I'm actually very satisfied with the comments on this topic about the servers being down. But it seems that The official forums are getting flooded by spoiled kids who always get what they want.
 Thank you Riot for your awesome service so far and good luck on getting the problems fixed!
I gave you an upvote, but I slightly disapprove.  (As if my approval might mean something.)  I too am thankful for stars, but being thankful for something more personal does not mean you are conceding the existence of god.  This seems like a slightly inflammatory response, and though it may be completely true, it seems a bit contrived.  You can be rational and still be grateful for family, friends, and the other things that make life livable.
 This immediately bothered me a little because it seemed contrived for the sake of promoting atheism.
Yesterday Eastbound on the Lakeshore I was in the lane for the Gardiner On Ramp at Simcoe tooting merrily along when I noticed the Abell Exterminator van behind to my left getting closer and closer. Then I noticed his blinker was on, and he was attempting to merge through me (his front wheel was pretty much in line with my rear wheel). If I was in a car, I would have been pinned. Luckily I had time and space to swerve, add a little throttle and get out of there. 
The car behind me had to hit the brakes to avoid the back end of the merging van and chose to slam on his horn as well. This caused me to look back and I realized the driver of the van was on a cell phone. 
Of course I took down his vehicle number and called the extermination company he worked for when I got home. 
- Van tried to merge through me on my motorcycle and a car behind me because he was on his cell. Be careful. 
His passives are great, but the mana restore is very low so many Tarics just ignore the mechanic completely. Good use of that passive is part of what defines a great Taric. You should be getting as many extra auto attacks in as possible, and play with an aggressive laner who likes to push. Keeping bottom lane under the enemy's tower is a great way to deny early CS, and proper warding of the river/tribrush allows you to do this with very little risk to yourself. Any time the enemy is able to push off their tower you have the best burst support w/ DPS like Graves/Draven who have very high physical only burst that is multiplied heavily by your shatter.
auto attack the creeps and push your lane, gg infinite mana and lane dominance.
My problem with building a new passive on Taric is that he's already quite strong.  He was originally designed as a fighter type instead of a support, and while the ult didn't carry over from that idea, the passive did.  It doesn't function in his primary role as a support, but any realistic change to his passive would be a buff, since it's really almost never relevant.  Sans hybrid/bruiser/jungler/non-support items, he doesn't attack fast enough to get regularly relevant cdr on his heal (yes, people get clutch heals sometimes, we're talking consistent help), and the mana he gets back from the hits are kinda pathetic.  The mana regen is even smaller than Kassadin's passive on his dinky little sword buff, and Taric's heal is pretty mana inefficient, considering the more popular healers like Soraka or support Kayle.  Most Taric players smack people for the damage and pretty much get mana only from towers or dragon, because pushing is not worth it and champions are better killed than leeched for mana.
 can't safely change it because it may as well not exist right now.  Changing his passive, imho, would require nerfs to maintain balance, since any addition would be strictly better than what he has right now.
In other news, there's a highly rated reply somewhere above that made a very fun sounding suggestion, where you gain mana back by being hit, or gain some regen buff when in combat, etc etc.  Like reverse his passive, or reverse Garen's and put it on mana.  That's a passive I can get behind, but it'd just be too powerful on him if the mana gain were relevant, and it'd be no different than it is now if the amount were too small
I mean, the biggest issue is while his passive makes no sense on a support, he is still a competitive pick and seen as generally a good support in many situations. A useful passive could easily push taric into the OP territory. Its a bit of flawed game design to have a passive like that on a support. However anything else may make him too strong.
 if it isn't broken don't fix it.
Who said anything about being a master of all those things?  Don't aim for perfection, aim to get it done.  
You don't need to have a master DOP, sound guy, and actors to make a great film.  Here, watch this: 
This was made by two guys and couple of their friends, with a miniDV camcorder and a cheap shotgun mic, and about $30 worth of costumes and props.  There is absolutely nothing technical in this short that someone couldn't learn in a few hours with a little online tutorial.  And yet, it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  
What they do have is talent.  Loads of it.  And lots of practice and making good stuff.  They got that way by doing, not wishing or hoping there was an affordable camera or professional sound mixer they could hire.  
Now, making a feature, that's a whole different story.  But chances are if you're prepared to make a good feature, you'll have several amazing shorts under your belt and no shortage of people wanting to help you out.  And if you don't have those things, you're probably not ready to make a feature.   
 Don't try to be a master, don't aim for perfection.  Just make lots of stuff and you can figure the rest out.  
Actually just happened to me - I started up a hardcore world yesterday, and I embarked on one hell of an underground build. I was happily mining along, when my final iron pickaxe broke. "No biggie", thought I "I'll just start a diagonal branch mine in one of the neighboring caves." And it was so. After about 2 minutes of mining with a stone pickaxe, I break a block, revealing the cave before me. What hit me next was unpredictable.
I look around through the tiny one-block hole, and I find the sought after iron. To gather the iron, I had to mine a staircase into the cave walls. I come upon the iron, feisty as a lion after not eating for a week, when I decide to look around for anything else precious. I look above, and I see a single stone brick. "Dafuq?" I responded to the image. I turn a mere 60 degrees, and as I gaze upon the sight, hilarity ensues. I found my first stronghold in minecraft, all because I wanted a smidgen of iron ore for some more pickaxes.
**-** Needed iron, found stronghold.
*P.S.* When I first saw your username I thought it said "Dolanoscopy".
I remember in 5th grade we were learning the 50 states.  I was a history/geography kid when I was younger, so I knew the 50 states from reading the book, but had never actually said each state.  I had missed the day our teacher went over all 50 states, but came in the next day when they entire class was going over them. We had to say each out loud. Well, when everyone went to say Arkansas, I said Are-Kansas (because hell, it looks that way). Teacher stopped and kids turned around (my last name starts with a z, so I'm always in the back) and just stared at me. Then the teacher made me say Arkansas five times in front of the class to teach me 2 lessons, one to not skip class and two: learn how to say the name correctly.  Didn't learn lesson one though ;)
I said Are-Kansas instead of Arkansas and was slightly humiliated for it.
I know this is going to get lost in background noise, but ...
A few years ago, I used the word "epitome". Having only read it, and used it, I pronounced it "Ep-I-tome". After an awkward pause, my grandma and my older brother laughed so hard they almost passed out. I couldn't figure out what was so funny. They had to explain it to me after I bugged them for days about it. I'm still getting shit for it. I cannot use the word to this day. &gt;&gt;
 Used the word epitome wrong, still hearing shit about it.
[This is an enhanced version]( so the text is more legible. It says "To Becky xx Love+Luck Josie Lawrence". 
[This is the back of the photo]( which has also been manipulated to sharpen the text. (It's not actually that gross. It's been in the same picture frame from home to home for twenty years.) It says:
Dear Becky
Thanks for your letter.
In answer to your questions - No I am not married!
I choose the amount of shows I wish to do so that's why I'm not always on the programme.
love Josie x
Here's the story. In 1992, Whose Line is it Anyway ran on Comedy Central in the states. I was twelve. I caught the second episode after school one day, and found myself hooked. Josie Lawrence was quickly one of my greatest heroines.
I penned her a letter and enclosed a button that I had made for her (a cow wearing sunglasses, classy). I slapped two stamps on it and having no idea who to address it to, I wrote as follows:
Hat Trick Studios
C/O Josie Lawrence
Somewhere in England
Two weeks later, I received a letter from England. I thought that it was from my pen-pal that I had at the time. The back of the envelope said "PS - Thanks for the lovely button!"
Inside was the reply from Josie.
Addressed a letter 'Somewhere in England' and it got there!
The world was somehow much larger and much smaller all in one moment.
I really like the concept. But I think you need to structure it so that each lie has it's own document. Otherwise the Mitt Romney page is going to get pretty fast.
This week i was linked to The Union_The Business Behind Getting High (youtube). After watching it I can't help being overwhelmed with the need to have this seen by as many people as possible. The first thing I have done is ripped the vid and converted/authored a DVD of which I am burning at least 20 copies and handing out to friends/family. This isn't enough.  
I thought about this for a few days and in my mind I picture having the manpower/funding to put thousands of these dvd's under wipers of cars in filled shopping mall's parking lots, billboards etc. etc.   
I know I'm missing tons of details in this plan (copyright?!) but almost any action begins with planning/discussion. How about some input? Any one up to getting out from behind your monitor and doing something to enact change/education on this issue?  
 get off your ass and make a difference.

I'll be honest here I have never, ever, fucked up that hard in a one night stand. Ever. So I can't really empathize much with you there. You dug yourself a pretty big hole there pal, but enough of telling you what you already know.  
If you wanna fix things, man the fuck up and find a way to reach her.  She's not answering her phone? Fine. Try another means. Facebook out of the question? Try another means. There is *always*, a way.  Get a friend to help if you have to and find a way to contact her.
The true goal here is to take that fucking ugly burden and humiliation off her shoulders (and yours), for something she didn't even do.  
If you don't fix this and leave it to hang and dry, it'll probably grate on you for months if not years to come, though I'm sure you knew that already.  
Oh, and even if the truth comes out and she accepts it, she still may never talk to you again. Who knows? Time will tell.
*** Man up and face it straight, or wallow in shame indefinitely
quoted for posterity:
Posting this on a throwaway account for obvious reasons and praying to god that she doesn't browse reddit herself. I've been friends with this girl since I was in elementary school. I started to have feelings for her in middle school and got friendzoned, you know the story. In high school she got a lot more popular than me and we sort of drifted apart, I resented her a lot at first but as I matured I started to realize that I was really just putting her on a pedestal and I might not have been the "nice guy" that I thought I was.
So we started talking again recently (both just graduated from the same high school class of 2012) and I went into it not really expecting a whole lot. Anyways she invited me to the end of the year party she was having at her place (her dad was out of town but knew she was having a party and is pretty cool with the drinking and whatnot) so I went. I didn't really know most of her friends so it was kind of awkward and I don't drink either but she was being really flirty with me. I wrote it off as her just being drunk rather than having a rekindled interest in me but she kept at it all night.
Now this is the important part-- I had my wisdom teeth removed right before the school year ended and the hydrocodone I was administered was giving me serious constipation, so I had been taking suppositories to relax my bowels at this point. I was starting to feel gassy and sick and so I was a little antsy to leave. The party was sort of winding down and I wanted to say goodbye before I went but a few of her friends were still there and I was a little nervous about interrupting being the outsider that I was (and even more nervous about using her toilet), so I waited around some more.
I guess I sort of was anticipating something to come out of it if I said goodbye to her alone, but I honestly would have preferred it to happen when she was sober. Once the last people were leaving she started putting her hands all over me and being really forward. She promised that she wasn't that drunk but I don't think it was true. She took me back to her bedroom and started taking her clothes off and even though I knew it was wrong I also knew we probably wouldn't see each other after this summer and I would regret missing an opportunity to finally lose my virginity to this girl I'd had feelings for for so long. We started making out on her bed and I got really flatulent at this point, but she was too loud and drunk to really notice. I finished pretty quickly and she sort of rolled over. It was an unpleasant experience, but I think that's normal for most people's first time and she really didn't make me feel too embarrassed so I felt okay about it. I ended up sleeping over- it was just something I had really wanted for a long time, to hold her in my arms through the night.
Once the night was over, that's when things got fucked up. I woke up literally covered in shit. I knew immediately it was the laxatives. There was gunky diarrhea all over the bedspread, all the way up my thighs and all over he back since we'd been spooning all night. She was still crashed out asleep at this point, and I just sat on the edge of the bed covered in my own feces crying for like five minutes. I went to her bathroom and showered myself, but after getting dressed I acknowledged that there was no way in hell I could get all the shit off of those sheets.
I know this is gonna make me look like an asshole but I fucking panicked at this point, Reddit. I did the only thing I could think of doing: I scooped up a small pile of poo with my hands, pulled the covers back, and smeared it on her bare asscheeks. I went into the kitchen, washed my hands, found a notepad and a pen and left her a little message by her bedside that read you shit yourself last night so i left. And then I booked it the fuck out of there.
I don't know what I expected to happen really. I just didn't want her to blame me for the shit, I would have felt more pathetic than I already did. But it's been five days now and I haven't heard from her at all, I tried calling twice and she hasn't responded. I'm worried as fuck, Reddit. I don't know what to say because I don't know whether she's too embarrassed to speak to me or worse if she thinks that I did it. On top of that the fact that she got drunk and had sex with me. Seriously, I need fucking help. Advice from anyone who's fucked up during a one-night stand. I want to fix things, but I don't want to embarrass her or incriminate myself. Thanks in advance, I'll keep you guys updated. Really need some support right now.
 had sex with friend when she was drunk, shit myself in her bed, blamed it on her, now she won't talk to me
I'm sorry to hear you think this way. There are definitely parents out there who are doing the damn best they can to be good parents and raise their kids right, even though they are working full time. I agree that some parents rely on daycare and school to raise their kids, and that is unfortunate. There are also parents who seek out early education schools instead of straight up daycares to help supplement the development of their child in ways that they don't know how. Proper early education schools, ones with recognized accreditation and actual teachers, are actually a great resource for kids while parents are at work.
These kinds of quality facilities are not just babysitters - the people working there are educated and trained in the physical, mental, and emotional development of babies and toddlers and everything the kids do all day has an educational/developmental goal. Infants get to play and their physical growth and progress is tracked and reported to parents. Toddlers learn colors and sing songs. Pre-k gets into alphabet and writing your name and drawing. Some early education schools take kids on field trips and to swim lessons too. All of this is done under trained supervision, and all progress is reported back to parents so they can continue the learning and development at home.
The socialization that kids get so early in life is invaluable and IMO is the single biggest benefit of early education schools. Kids may get a little of it on a play date, but in the safe environment of an early education school they get to interact with lots of different kids. This teaches them how to behave without their parents, how to behave around other kids, and how to behave around other adults. Some grown people still don't have these skills, but there's 4 year olds out there who can handle themselves and excel academically in Kindergarten and beyond because they don't have to get over the social hump that other kids who stayed home with mommy and daddy have to learn.
**let's not confuse daycare with early education schools. one is all day babysitting that busy parents drop their kids off at, one is an actual school aimed at the development of babies and toddlers by educated and trained professionals.**
I've had the worse sort of issues with Pizza Hut. I ordered a pizza online, was happy, yay. After an hour goes by and no pizza has arrived, I call the store to see what's up. The girl on the phone looks up my order and then says, "Oh. We don't deliver to that area." I attempt to keep my cool as I ask her why their website would allow me to order my pizza as a delivery if that was the case, to which her response was, "I don't know." I then asked her when they were planning to call me to let me know my pizza wasn't coming. All she could offer me was a, "It's done now if you want to pick it up?" I angrily go to the location to pick up the pizza because I'm starving and don't care at this point. When the guy behind the counter hands me the pizza, he says, "That'll be $17." Apparently because the actual delivery order online couldn't be completed, they cancelled it, and thereby cancelled the payment on my debit card. Silly, angry me forgot my debit card at home on my computer desk because I was in such a hurry to gtfo and get my pizza. All I had in my wallet was a hundred dollar bill which they wouldn't accept. I had to run across the street to a gas station to make change for my cold pizza which I paid full price for. He didn't say thank you.
 I hate pizza hut and will pay full price for crap if I'm hungry enough.
As a general manager for one of the large pizza companies please all of you hear this. Your pizza is late because we are getting destroyed at our store. If you call to complain about your pizza not being there on time just at the very least acknowledge that we are doing out absolute best to get things out of our store as quickly as possible for you we do not, at any point, intentionally delay your order. There are far too many people out there that think they are the only person ordering pizza on a Friday night no, you are not, I on average have 100+ deliveries go out every Friday night running 5-6 drivers. On average that is more than enough but, sometimes, we get a groupin of 10-15 orders literally at once that will slow us down to all living shit. Thank you my rant is now over this is just something that has been bothering me. Good day too all of you and please order from papa johns tonight tell them reddit sent you!
*** I bitched about bitching and then ramparted the fuck out.
It wasn't Alex Garland's fault, it was Danny Boyle's. Read the script. It's fine. Perhaps you have noticed that Mr. Boyle insists on putting a spiritual or destiny element in virtually all of his movies, even if it doesn't work. Alex Garland says he was writing from an atheistic perspective and Danny Boyle clearly interpreted the script in a bad way while making the movie. Boyle insisted on adding his own poorly thought-out perspective to a film that it did not belong in whatsoever. 
Sunshine was incredible until the 3rd act. Fuck Danny Boyle. Slumdog Millionaire sucked.
TLDR Boyle cracked Sunshine in half and basically ruined it because he thought it was important to show a spiritual interpretation of Garland's atheistic story.
As a pizza guy, I can sincerely say, fuck you. We drive TO YOUR FUCKING  HOUSE with a HOT MEAL for your ungrateful ass. That costs actual gas money. Most drivers don't get much gas money at all, AND are paid less than minimum wage for road hours (I get $4.15). 
People like you are the problem in the delivery business and the reason that this business is filled with burnouts and shitty workers. Maybe if you actually tipped the person who hand delivered a fresh pizza to your door, hard working drivers like me would be more inclined to stay in the business.. It's not a matter of us feeling like we deserve your money for driving 10 miles, its a matter of economics and human decency. 
And please don't give me the classic "I shouldn't have to pay your hourly wage, the pizza place should pay you more" routine because guess what.. DRIVERS MAKING $4.15 AN HOUR IS THE REASON YOUR LARGE MEAT LOVERS PIZZA COSTS $10. 
All you non tippers fail to realize that the price of food is directly affected by how much the employees are paid. Also, you look like a fucking asshole if you don't tip (not to mention your just embarrassing yourself in front of friends, gf). Who in their right mind would want to be the source of hundreds of peoples ruined days? Oh right, a narcissistic hate-filled person.



*** Delivery drivers pay for their own gas, tip them AT LEAST the amount of gas it took to get to your house.

There was a lot of anticipation for their follow-up to OK Computer, which had pretty quickly and universally been hailed as a masterpiece.  Mainstream rock music in the late 90s and early 2000 was absolutely awful. Think Limp Bizkit awful. Everyone was waiting for someone to "save" rock music, and Radiohead were expected to be the band to do it. 
It was a long wait. This was also around the time that the Internet was really catching on. They marketed the album online through little blips, which was unusual, if not totally unprecedented, at the time. 
The best part was that the band started blogging during their recording sessions. Again, this may not be obvious to someone as young as you who grew up in the Internet age, but this was new and thrilling at the time. The glimpses revealed through these blog posts were tantalizing and encouraging and frustrating all at once. It started to become clear that they weren't making a traditional follow up to OK Computer but what exactly they *were* making kind of remained a mystery. 
It leaked to the web early. I remember waiting waiting waiting as each individual song downloaded slowly over my dialup connection. When I finally had them all and listened to the album for the first time, I was nearly moved to tears. Unlike many people, I didn't find it difficult or anything like that. From the opening notes of Everything in its Right Place, it sounded like the perfect way to follow OK Computer. 
Early reaction was very mixed. I think people forget that. Now, of course, *everyone* recognizes it as "the best album of the 00s" etc. But when it first hit the web and people started listening - and reacting - to it, there was a lot of negative feedback. Some people were confused; many people were disappointed that they hadn't made OK Computer II; some people thought that the band ha made an enormous and irrevocably career-killing mistake. By the end of 2000 the critical acclaim was nearly unanimous but it wasn't really like that immediately upon release, it took a few months for everyone to come around. 
 They were supposed to save rock music by making The Next Great Rock Album.  It took a long time for a lot of people to realize that's *exactly* what they did. 
I was 17 studying A-Levels when Kid A came out and it solidified my status as a Radiohead fan boy.
As a younger teenager I had a CD Player with an alarm clock feature so was woken up daily by OK Computer. By the time Electioneering came on, my mum would shout at me to turn down my stereo and to get out of bed.
My (proudly geeky) social group at school included someone who had acquired (legitimately) a pre-release copy of the album a few weeks before it was due to come out. This included the hidden book which was pretty awesome. I wasn't allowed to take the CD home because my friend was worried about me uploading it to Napster. So we listened to it in the common room.
Some other members of the same group were heavily into IDM: Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, etc. I remember travelling into London a few times to the Warp Records parties at Electrowerkz called Nesh.
For me, Kid A was the right record at the right time. All these factors: my existing fanboyism, influences from my *outcast* social group and an album from a group that most people didn't get, created a time in my life that I'll never forget.
I started that school year, my final year of A-levels, seeing Radiohead play Victoria Park in London. The year finished with seeing them play South Park in Oxford. I distinctly remember that it started pouring down with rain when they played *How To Disappear Completely*.
*** It was excellent.
Besides the whole "snowball early, get fed hard, farm hard", and make the midgame as short as possible, other possible ways that you can prevent trist from falling behind is by having your team peel for Tristana if the enemy just rushes for her, or just avoiding engagements in the first place. 
Personally, when I play with my AD carry and he plays Tristana, I try to pick a support that can either be aggressive early, or peel for him. Soraka isn't going to be able to do anything for tristana in a team fight, but alistar or janna can offer so much for the AD carry both in terms of aggression and peeling. Having champions that do better mid game, such as Cassiopeia, Nocturne, or Shen can also help cover your weaknesses.
Farm hard and try to get fed early to make the mid game as short as possible. If that doesn't happen, avoid engagements. If THAT doesn't happen, try your best in that engagement.
Do all the leg exercises in the world.  Other people looking at your body have a different perception than you do.  And that's total bullshit that you have "bulky" legs after a few months of lifting.  I'm a guy that's a year into working out and I know I have above average size legs but I wouldn't even call them bulky.  Stop sabotaging yourself and keep your routine going.
 my girlfriend is jealous of my ass because of all of the squats I've done.
No offense but this isn't a super reply.  And it's voted to the top, which is even less helpful.
&gt;I don't see any way that your thighs are too bulky if you've only been lifting for a couple of months. 
- I don't believe you.
She's gaining muscle mass in her legs, it's not a mystery.
That reply implies you are confused dude I'm sorry. They are not rewarding anyone, in fact in Ireland they did shut down all the non-profitable banks essentially they just didn't burn the debt. What they did was they absorbed the nonprofit able banks into a National Assets Management Agency or NAMA for short. The banks no longer trade and the state now owns the debt, NAMA (a bank itself) is tasked with the job of selling the debt and the have been doing quite well so far. This is the strategy that the EU and economists in general encourage.
In relation to why the people haven't been jailed, most of them knew enough to cover their own asses or hire lawyers who could do it for them. Yo don't get to the top of a bank without being an incredibly smart guy, they realised what they were doing. The way the system is set up the responsibility for the system running smoothly is actually on the central bank. In most of these situations the central bank was negligent and not auditing he banks properly. In Canada one of the reasons they were relatively sheltered is because their central bank has a huge role in auditing their banks and did so correctly.
The eurozone crisis isn't as simple as all this either, you also have to factor in the currency. They set up a currency without any form of control over it because nobody would agree to it otherwise. Germany made shit loads of money giving credit to all these countries and surprise once we hit an recession everything imploded because everybody owed huge amounts of money to Germany. Now of course it's stemmed a political crisis because Germany holds all the cards and she is not looking out for anybody interests but her own. If Germany had been mandated to refinance the other countries through a stimulus package then we wouldn't be in this mess. 
nobody is getting rewarded for bad behaviour, everybody is following the law. Should there be changes to the law? Possibly. Should there be a lo more federal oversight? Most definitely. Should we burn the debt? Of course not, that would cause a global depression and it wouldn't be pretty.
They were kept out of the euro as a safe haven for (largely) british bond investment in case the EU went tits up. We (yes, we, yerra few naggins be grand) were used as an experiment BY the EU to see what would happen if a government gave a blanket guarantee to the banks *regardless of their level of inevitable implosion*. It didn't work, so we're fuckin skint. It's also why "we" don't really like the idea of a blanket bailout for Spanish banks by the EU directly, as opposed to letting a government tank a country's kitty by doing it themselves (like they let lenihan and those other assholes do). Lower risk for bigger countries? Fuck that. 
Anyway, Iceland. Population c. 300,000. For a whole host of reasons they were in a better position to say "fuck off" to the whole problem, aided in no small measure by the collective outrage at Brown trying to recoup british bondholder losses through anti-terror laws. I have no idea of the how on their emergence from catastrophic financial ruin, but i know it's to do with the following
1. Ability to control their own currency (because the same people that used them as a cash mattress kept them out of the common currency)
2. Collective responsibility by a small population
3. Some semblance of doing what needs to be done regardless of short term pain

**- we're bigger, we're stupider, we made worse decisions, the EU doesn't give a fuck about us.** 

EDIT : Drunk, so if i'm wrong on some of these please let me know.
I think the choice mainly comes down to IV and V. IV is sort of the culmination of all previous Civ games, and with the expansions is the most complex version of Civ available. Civ V takes a different approach, paring down a lot of the micromanagement and letting the player focus on the broader strategies. It's a bit more 'gamey' than IV, while IV leans a bit more towards simulation.
Naturally, the players who love to tweak and tinker with every detail prefer IV (and in some cases, violently so.) I think IV is an amazing game, but after my empire gets to a certain size, I kind of get sick of having to micromanage everything to stay competitive. For this reason, I've come to prefer Civ V, although I will admit that I do miss some of the features that were taken out or simplified. The AI in Civ V is significantly poorer than the Civ IV AI, particularly because it can't handle the more tactical combat. But then again, it's really hard to go back to the stack of doom once you've had a taste of one-unit-per-tile.
if you want detail and complexity, get IV; if you're not particularly interested in managing every single aspect of your empire, check out V.
You don't have to pay for it. You could wait until it's on nick.com for free. Or you could wait until they rerun it for free.
But if you missed it, then either wait for the legal free versions or buy it. If you REALLY want to watch it now, then buy it.
enjoying a tv show is a luxury, not a need, so if it costs money, then you should not be able to circumvent that just because you missed the premiere.
 You should have realized that because that's how the world works. Have you been living under a rock your whole life?
There comes a point where you end up getting diminishing returns for your money because the architecture of the components can only go so far. I just messed around on Newegg and going with quite extravagant parts I ended up at $1,800. The set up is absolutely amazing and can run any game in existence on max settings. Another $600 will get you a very minimal increase in performance and there are no programs or games that will really be able to utilize that extra $600 worth of stuff. With a $600 video card you'll be able to run everything on ultra now, and if you want you can upgrade right away when the next generation of video cards comes out and sell your old one.
Spending say 1500 now and using $1000 to upgrade your computer later as new generations of hardware come out will allow to you to run everything on ultra settings for a greater length of time and you will have a much better performance / $ ratio. If the money is burning a hole in your pocket and you really feel like spending it all at once though, go with what will make you happy.
Did you even bother reading the first paragraph of the article I linked you?  The declaration sets the role, the constitution delivers.
and yes, you did say that they aren't connected.

  &gt;  like saying that the declaration and the constitution aren't connected
&gt;They aren't, deal with it. 
dude, if you want to see a straw man, look at yourself.  You keep using the words [Organic Law]( like they are helping your argument.  When you can read about organic law and see this right in the first paragraph.
&gt;The Organic Laws of the United States of America can be found in Volume One of the United States Code which contains the General and Permanent Laws of the United States. U.S. Code (2007)[1] defines the organic laws of the United States of America to include the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776, the Articles of Confederation of November 15, 1777, the Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, and the Constitution of September 17, 1787
and that is just from looking at wikipedia for five seconds.  [Here you can *read* the actual organic laws of the united states of america](
So, again, please don't use words that you don't know what they mean.
&gt;This entire ploy by you has been a strawman because you can't deal with the argument
What argument?  That the declaration of independence isn't a founding document of our system of government or that it isn't a part  of organic law?  Because I'm pretty sure I've linked to several sources showing you that they are connected.  And I know that I've put your organic law argument to rest, seeing how the declaration is right in the organic laws of the USA.
**TL:DR**
&gt;Nothing that the declaration says has any legal weight for the US. It has absolutely no bearing on organic law,
[No, you are mistaken and here is irrefutable evidence to the contrairy.](
I agree with you. For example I work at a place that while the amount of time we get off doesn't compare to the Euro style at all, our boss's will not refuse someone a week vacation if that person has the PTO saved up. Our CAD admin did just that. He took a week off without any gripe from the boss. Unfortunately CAD went down while we was on vacation. He basically worked his entire vacation anyway. 
; the guy has so much on his plate we can't get away even if he tried. After a while it creates that "why even bother mentality." It's not American's don't want the vaca, they are too tired to fight for it. Pick your battle.  
I saw it for the first time the other week and it drove me mad. It's the timing and the flat acting. All the little nuances that go into good performance and direction just aren't present at all. In the original first episode with almost the exact same lines, the way each line is delivered (and perhaps more importantly what the actors are doing when they're not saying anything) gives you an instant insight into who the main characters are. Chris Morris's Renholm is a barking, slightly raving madman who knows nothing about business but knows everything there is to know about[ ***BUSINESS***]( Jen is clearly seen to be inept within seconds. Before answering the phone in the original Roy doesn't just wait for a bit then answer, he labours over the whole process, eating his donut, licking his fingers, looking like he's reaching for the phone but then grabbing his cup. When he does respond he's not making some chipper joke, he fucking *hates* his job and the people he works under. In comparison the Americans are just people saying lines. 

"I say a thing"

"Then I say a funny thing"

laugh track

"Alright let's move onto the next joke"
There's no care in it, no real effort beyond the bare minimum. It's not so much a problem with America as it is with almost any adaptation. It all comes down to the fact that the people making the show just don't care about it. And why should they? It's not *their* show. They didn't write it. They didn't come up with any of the ideas. The original show was written and directed by Graham Linehan alone, about characters he came up with and jokes that spewed from his head and all the hundreds of little references and in-jokes that *mean something to him*. So when he's picking the actors and telling them what to do and overseeing the edit and everything else, there's no question of half-arseing it because it's *his*. He wants it to be something to be proud of, not just another pay-cheque. 
The exact same thing will happen with the inbetweeners, mark my words. As well as being their creation, a huge amount of the jokes in the show come from the teenage years of the writers, Damon Beesley and Iain Morris. The show is as much laughing at them as it is at the actual cast, so in what world would some entirely unrelated American who doesn't get the concept of self-deprecation put the time and effort into it as they did?


***: Adaptions are bullshit because good shows/films are made by their creators for personal reasons, not just because they think it'll be profitable.
Well, 4th pic is the best, imo.

 No.
support kayle works on lower elos. just Q E play agressive level 1 and zone them like hell. if they dont back off and try to farm under their turret they die to you/ad carry and you snowball. if they back off they lose farm and your carry snowballs. they dont know how to deal with that.

Meth is a hell of a drug.. any amphetamine, really.
I've done the dance myself and still consider myself an addict, despite 10+ years between me and my last use - there are days where I still desperately want it. Fortunately, I've found some respite in caffeine when it gets really bad; it's surprising what a couple (dozen) cups of strong coffee can do to quell those urges.
Good on you for getting out and not looking back. I spent a short time involved in this, though any time is too long with meth, and ended up stealing from and lying to every single person I cared about, just so I could get more meth.
- Don't trust tweakers, ever. Even weekend users. They lie, they steal, they lie and steal at the same time.

&gt;Remind me again, why we still believe capitalism IS working?
Based on your shocking ignorance of economics, I'm assuming that your Marxist college professors have neglected your education. So here are the facts: The goal of capitalism isn't to give everyone a unicorn that farts glitter. Rather, the goal of capitalism is to allow people to use their intelligence, innovation and hard work to earn a profit by selling goods of services that other people judge as valuable. That's it: work, innovate, sell, take money to the bank. The end. 
And here's the proof that capitalism is working. 
Below are the totals from my 401K and Roth IRA, dating back to 2006 (the year after I graduated from college). I opened the accounts in 2005 with deposits of $1000 in each. Each month, my employer contributes 1.5% of my gross salary (~$40) into the 401k. Most months I contribute 10-15% of my take home pay into the accounts (~$250). The accounts are invested in about 12 different funds, ranging from very safe bond and income funds, to very volatile international and small business funds.

You'll notice that only during *three* quarters in the last 6 years did my accounts lose value. During this so-called horrible economy, capitalism has increased my net worth by ten-fold. And I am a middle-class, blue-collar guy. 
 read less Marx, read more *Money* and *Forbes*. The stock market as a whole has grown an average of 10% per year for over a century. Some years it's up 30%, other years it's down 20%. But the average annual growth is about 10%. With regular contributions, my accounts are doubling in value every 21 months (on average). This means I'll be worth somewhere near $2.5 million by my mid-50s. So I'll be in the evil 1%, and laughing at your sad asses. 
this video like is extremely misleading. any "documentary" like this from liberal filmmakers or conservative filmmakers should not be taken at face value. It is essentially propaganda. I have seen democrats try to do this to rallies against obama and it is equally as construed. For example, they show a statistic that says Romney had a bit over 64,000 private donations after a guy said he had 24... the documentary then shows a statistic that states obama had only .04% of the population donate to him. These stats mislead the viewer because .04% of the population is about 12.5 million contributors.
these videos suck and mislead the viewer, no matter which side they come from.
Congrats man. I come from a family of of fatties. I grew skinnier than my brother, and plus I worked out like crazy in high school. My younger bro at 15 was 220 at 5'5". Got made fun of the his life from kids at school, and I had no idea. When he broke down and told me, First thing I did was get the us gym memberships, and punching Bag. I trained to him as though it was rocky movie. 2 years later hes 159, has muscles, loves to box, and no gut and best of all NO ONE picks on him (stood up to the childhood bully and kid got scared) and he exudes confidence, and now a lady killer..... Tl dr, bro lost weight and became rocky. 
Erm, no.  He's a well known poster on the penny arcade forums, so even before this people knew he was a bioware writer.  He redacted the post afterwards because very publicly calling out your boss and bosses boss on the fact that their hubris was single handedly destroying a franchise tends to place your job in jeopardy.  Most people went along with the redaction because he's a pretty cool guy + a great writer that we want to stay with bioware so he keeps making the awesomeness.
Not fake, real, but shhhhh totally fake right right.
There was a time that some of the people who formed wellplayed were reddit mods. Some of them ran community events like KOTH's, others ran big events like The SCReddit invitational, others handled stuff like donations for events and revenue from r/starcraft's partnered stream (which was when partnered streams were a whole lot harder to get).
When they left for Wellplayed they destroyed as much as they could. They locked the community casters out of the stream which killed the events. Shut down the website (screddit.com) which served as a hub of info for the subreddit was disabled. 
Most importantly, financials stopped being reported. They claimed all of this was part of their "brand" they didn't want others continuing. Even though all of that had been sold as community projects. Said they had put the work into the getting the money raised even though they were taking donations under the premise that it was for this community.
They never made any attempt to pass off events like the Reddit weekend tournaments. Instead they used their position to damage what would become their competitor.
Eventually they apologized and promised to give the SCReddit stuff back but I'm pretty sure they never did. As of writing, screddit.com **STILL** directs you to wellplayed.org
**Wellplayed staff abused their Reddit positions to harm the site as it was about to become a competitor.**
[EDIT: All I can find in retrospect was that SeaGnome was making it seem to other mods that there was infact some money lying around after the SCRO's were done. Misremembering this is probably what led to my confusion. I'm certain if non WellPlayed staff were involved on this end everything went fine.](
"It made me want to start a forum that treats people like adults and lets them decide if they want to watch Savior or Destiny by themselves."
Well, maybe... MAYBE you could follow them on twitch/own3d or even follow their twitter!!!
I can't believe you honestly want a site purely to address the fact you're incapable of doing this.
Your other points:
* Ad Revenue. So, along with your hosting costs and paying contributors for their work how many adverts are you going to have per page to have ON TOP OF THAT money for showmatches etc
* Plenty, and I mean plenty, of tournament info is on TL. Their current top 4 articles: GSL Code S group that starts in 20 mins, Latest TSL Qualifier results, Lastest IPL Results including an interview with Empire.BeastyQT on his all kill and the SK Planet Round 1 recap. To the right of that are the following headlines: OSL Groups, MLG to be free, Weekly news compilation, Scarlett to Acer, ASUS Summer, Nada retires, Dreamhack info, Genius quits MVP, Browder interview.
* There is a countdown for major events in the top left when they are less than a week away.
* How big is your front page going to be with talk show VODs on front page? It's really not too hard to just check itmejp/videos, thegdstudio/videos, onemoregame/videos if you've missed one of their weekly (cough) shows.
* There is a direct link to the liquipedia page of any on going tournament. In the news articles I stated above there are also links to GSL, IPL TAC etc etc liquipedia pages.
* Who do you count as VIP?
* Yes this is a stupid idea, if you honestly don't think pros discuss things then you're mad. If they want to discuss it publicly they'll do it on a talk show, reddit or TL and if not they'll do it privately. This method won't increase the number of pros discussing stuff as it's not private, as shocked as you might be most pros do actually talk about stuff and reply to each other on TL etc
* You can do this on TL, you clearly just haven't bothered to use the site.
* Yeah you repeated this point already
* TL rules are pretty fucking obvious to follow
- stop trying to design a site purely as TL delisted Destiny for a month when your ideas for a site are terrible.
Why did Idra get leniency?  Because TL makes decisions that benefit the TL community as they perceive it.  Just because Starcraft is synonymous with TL doesn't mean that TL is identical to the community at large.
People keep bringing up this decision but never remember the particular circumstances.  Shortly before Idra got banned, he was advertising on twitter/etc. "if I get over X viewers I'll do a special replay analysis stream" or something of that nature.  By keeping Idra's stream featured TL still encouraged their users to take advantage of Idra's analysis (and kept Idra from backing out on his promise).
On the other hand, what was Destiny bringing to the table at the time besides drama?  Viewership is hard to argue, since most viewers would probably just find a different stream to watch.  I'm betting they wouldn't have removed his stream if he had an upcoming contribution to the TL community.
Teamliquid goes easier on players that contribute to their community.  Destiny's main contribution is just "being there" but otherwise does nothing special for TL.
On point 1. Frankly building the website is basically the easy part in my opinion. Building a community that allows it to sustain itself and fosters growth is the hard part (along with admin and general maintenance - the bit that are necessary but not fun).
It isn't a build it and they will come project.
Learn to work on your own car. The more you can do yourself, the better. I have also heard rumors that drivers save on gas when they ride with their windows down and the A/C off. If you deliver to an area that has lots of pets, bring doggie treats. If you deliver to an area with lots of kids, perhaps start bringing pre-wrapped, factory sealed candy. The candy is a little bit further out there though, because people are far more concerned with their kids possibly getting poisoned than their dogs. If you drive anything bigger than a Ford Explorer, you might want to reconsider being a driver. I've driven SUV's/trucks for years, and worked in pizza since I was 16. I can tell you that you won't even break even on a bad day driving a gas hog. If you're a female, you automatically will get better tips than most of the male drivers. I would say go for being cute if you're a female, and funny if you're a male. Plus, always, always, always be professional. The customer is always right, so always be polite. If you can't handle assholes, you're in the wrong job. You will get some bad customers. You've got to be able to forget the bad ones to get tips from the good ones though. Many times drivers just have to suck it up when they get to work. Whatever is going on, you have to act like your sole concern when delivering is that customer's satisfaction. Just a few I've picked up over the years. Hope it helps.
 Do whatever special you can to make that customer feel like they are your only concern right that moment.
I'm not impressed.  In the US, BPA has been used for 40 years, yet meningiomas, which have several known common causes, are not even in the top 15 cancers, with about 21,000 a year new cases, 90% of which are benign cancers.  This means that even with the vast amount of BPA that has been consumed over this time, there are only 2,100 malignancies every year, from multiple causes.  And 40 years is far longer than it takes to determine if a substance is ever going to create a public nuisance.
- the anti-BPA advocates are making much adieu about nothing.  Again.
Look at it this way. Berb had 21 apps this season. That right there is 21 apps we can 'directly give to Kagawa' in a way, without necessarily changing the team. Just imagine him as replacing one of our four strikers.  
This seasons apps:  
Rooney - 43.  
Welbeck - 39.  
Hernandez - 36.  
Berbatov - 21.  
Citys apps for 4 strikers are 48 / 43 / 32 / 15 which brings me to my next point. As good as having varied players is, i feel one of Hernandez or Welbeck played too much, and i thought it was Hernandez this season, leraving room for more apps for Kagawa.  
What i have also thought about is Welbeck on the right and Kagawa on the left behind Rooney (or even Hernandez) for a 4-3-2-1 formation. A way to give Welbeck time, perhaps people like Jones more experience in CM with less pressure on him than if he was in a 2 man midfield. Ofcourse this is just one example, im sure there are more.  
Welbeck, Hernandez, Kagawa are players who will get gametime if they are doing well. If Kagawa doesnt do as well as he should, boom, Welbeck plays, etc.  
if clubs can make 4 strikers work easily enough, it wont be much difference here.
Had a char like this in D2, a novasorc with insane FCR and +skills, so I know what you mean. Nowhere near there on D3 yet (just got to Belial on inferno with my wizz). That said, I think innovative and creative builds will ultimately be what does this, and D3 simply hasn't been out long enough to see these builds emerge.
To make my point, until 2 days ago I ran with the glass cannon venom hydra/blizz/teleport kite build 95% of wizzes use, at 30k life, 38k dps, 350 res, and 4500 armor (but only 8% crit). I was making progress, but I'd die a decent amount and felt far from godly. Then I switched to the crit-based melee wiz spec and re-geared to drop DPS, increase defensive stats, and add +crit and even though my DPS dropped 10k, i feel godlier than ever.
I face tanked butcher in a 2 player game (my buddy lagged on fire and died at the beginning), demolished a pull gone bad with dual champ packs, and roflstomped rooms full of white mobs. It's the closest thing to "god mode" I've felt in D3 thus far, although again- NOT Act III/IV so take that with a grain of salt.
- once people come up with cool synergistic builds and gear accordingly. The cookie cutter ones floating around now work, but with the skill variety &amp; depth built into the game we've only barely scratched the surface of possible synergies.
[edit] my gear is pretty crappy too- less than 5M invested in total.
Seriously dude?  Who the fuck is going to read all that shit?!
- blah, blah, blah, America, freedom, religion, gays, atheism...
Hypothetically, lets think about some future earth where we do not manage our technologies and opportunities properly. there are limited resources on earth and such, and what if renewable resources and the technology to supply enough food does not keep pace with growing populations?
Is it a responsible thing to do to bring a child into a world full of starvation, misery and death?'
Though my thoughts really don't pertain mostly to anything that the OP was talking about, just more like ramblings on how shitty this world could be become.  Though this probably isn't the place to have these future disaster discussions.
But lets say some huge natural catastrophe struck earth and food stocks were destroyed.  It wouldn't be a very smart thing to bring more life into the earth then it can support for us.  It doesn't really apply now, but under harsh circumstances, I don't think reproduction can be considered a right, and would more likely be a hazard.
yea, the people in ops post were shitty, but then i rambled on scenarios like an asteroid hitting the earth
Because Reddit in general seems to absolutely hate cops. Videos and stories of very corrupt officers pop up and people seem to want to assume they are all bad. I sat an argued with a guy that not **all** Austin Police Officers are bad in another thread. He said there was overwhelming evidence that they are **all** bad even though there is none. Even though I live in Austin and this guy is from god knows where, I got downvoted into oblivion and then Reddit celebrated his hatred of police. 
 There are bad/corrupt cops out there but not all of them are bad/corrupt. 
So, you're arguing that just because something is law, it makes it 'right'?
The guy is walking around in broad-daylight with a gun on his hip; maybe I'm a bit of a puss-puss, but as I said before, this is Portland, Maine we are talking about-- not the wild west.
I'm not arguing whether or not the guy was in his legal limit, I'm just saying that the guy shooting the video was so obviously fully tourqued at his chance to show the officer who's boss-- AND POST THAT SHIT ON YOUTUBE......(who, mind you, is doing a terribly shitty job that whether you'd like to admit it or not, is necessary)
As to your point about customer service-- that's a completely false statement. You can't just pin a retail mantra to a public-service position--it's too far from reality (once again, I'm not arguing against 'ideal', just stating the reality of the situation).
The cop is a person too, the (unknown) guy is holding a gun, in a place where guns are obviously not the norm, and the cameraman's dick couldnt be any wetter as he is talking AT the officer as if he was reading his notes off of a piece of paper.
-Fucking sense and sensibility, man.
&gt; Oh god, sorry about ranting. I could go on forever, I'll stop.
I think we both could, and I will certainly applaud your ability to remain civil and speak intelligently about the matter at hand.  (I, myself, have been guilty of lapses on this at times)
That said:
&gt;...the 200 year old Constitution...
Yes, I hear this quite a bit.  The argument about the document written by a bunch of old dead guys.
The country we know of today called the United States of America only exists because of the Declaration of Independence and is allowed to function because of the Constitution (being a government of enumerated powers n' all).  Without either one o these documents, we have no US.  All laws must be derived from the Constitution.  If the people wish to change that, it must be achieved through Revolution (peaceful or otherwise), in which case, we would have a new country all together.
And with that comes the second amendment.  That "militia" language has been problematic for some time.  Primarily because of the inverted structure of the military relative to what they intended.
For more than 100 years, the American military consisted of a small regular army (federal) supported primarily by larger state militia.  Militia were always intended to be regulated at the *state* level.  *not* the federal.  This structure ensured that defense was the responsibility of the everyday man and decentralized, keeping us from waging offensive wars.  But most importantly, it had an additional check-and-balance of the people on the government, a key to keeping freedom.  This is why it's amendment 2 after speech.  We chose to disrupt this arrangement by centralizing (and I think today, we can see the wisdom in their original configuration).  However, this does not diminish the importance of their intention of keeping an armed populous.
The key to your Jefferson quote was:
&gt; Each generation is as independent as the one preceding, as that was of all which had gone before.
Meaning, **we** are responsible for maintaining our liberty.  The document is just a tool to that end and can be abused by anyone.  They knew that the natural tendency of government was towards tyranny.  In order to keep this in check, a government *must* fear it's people, not vice versa.  And if it get's out of check, it is the right *and* responsibility of the people to overthrow and replace that government.  Which is why Jefferson also said:
&gt; The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.
Unfortunately, modern generations have become complacent, infected with normalcy bias.  Just because we don't have hot tyranny today doesn't mean we wont tomorrow.  And we are doing their work for them by turning the populous into little more than cattle. Disarming the people is empowering tyrants of the future.
 I rant too.  lol
I'm not the first but let me try and make Tax clear for everyone.
You go through life, with all likely hood that you'll pretty much benefit from every government program and expenditure (such as schools, healthcare, military defense, economic regulations etc) for the vast majority of these services most people have already benefited from in some way, and if they haven't they're pretty much garaunteed to at some point. Through all of these benefits you've been able to lead a productive life and earn (hopefully) a good amount of money, then you re contribute some of that money so those programs can be maintained, not just for you but the children born after you who should damn well get the same benefits you did. 
I Know the thought of the government leeching off your income and such might be painful, but they've made thatt income possible (and in a lot of ways made you being alive a possibility) and now you have to repay your debt to society, AKA, Pay taxes.
And you only need to look at a few examples to realize Free Market isn't good for everything, free market is brutally effective, but greedy and inefficient, Government run programs are (typically) more efficient, and that's why in countries like England, we pay a fraction of what an American would to health care companies, through tax, and receive a better service.
I know that was a bit of a read, so for the **Taxes make sense, you owe society and without taxes society as we know it could not exist, stop bitching about it because it's extremely ignorant.**
Honestly, regardless of opinions for or against this particular piece of legislation, this is my biggest complaint with modern politics. 
We (the general population) are not educated enough to understand how to fix a widespread problem, such as the so-called healthcare crisis. So, as our democracy is set up, we elect officials that should more more specifically educated to fix these problems. The problem is, politicians know that we aren't very good at knowing whether a proposed solution will actually work, so we begin to pick the person who is able to explain the problems with the system. The problem is, picking out the problems in a system is much easier than providing a solution to said problems. So the politicians are not held accountable for the kinds of solutions they put forth, but rather that they did in fact put forth solutions.
It is striking how many Democratic politicians did not approve of this piece of legislation. It's disproportionate to the amount of Democratic voters who say they support it. I think this comes from the bulk of the voters being uneducated on solution since the president didn't need to put forth specifics during the election. I'm sure he made sweeping statements about some of the traits that are included, but we didn't know the specifics. But these are just observations.
** I agree that it's much more difficult to provide a solution than to point out the mistakes in any situation in life. Also, I believe most American voters are not educated enough on this piece of legislation or most current legislation, which is SCARY.**
&gt;intolerant
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
When is the last time atheists started a lobby against religious rights? Fired an employee for being Christian? Threw someone out of their restaurant for saying a prayer over their meal? Or advocated actual violence against the religious? Never. Fucking. Happened.
Disrespectful, maybe. Intolerant? Not so much.
But the meat of the matter is much more simple. A good demonstration would be to ask whether it is the case, that when someone pushes you and you push back, are both you being "pushy"? Atheism itself has no substance. It is a response, a counter point to rampant misconduct by theism as a force in our society. Without something to criticize, the entire "new atheism" movement is entirely meaningless.
Criticism of a reaction must always consider the cause of that reaction, and whether or not such a reaction is warranted. In this case, calling someone an idiot for propping up a corrupt dogma construct engaging in despicable acts ranging from the introduction of creationism to the science curriculum to denying people equal rights based on their beliefs, gender or sexuality... well, I think that's reasonable.
 Atheists are "pushing back", not being intolerant and pushy.
To start, this post is a little gross.  Words like oozy are used.  So, reader beware.
This is exactly how my right toe looked about a month ago - I stubbed a toe once while crack climbing, and then the nail just died.  I've also lost toe nails while running in college with disturbing frequency.  My freakishly huge big toes have something to do with it...
Anyway, my suggestion is to make sure that you've got some nail underneath before you trim the top off.  I would pry up the nail and look under, and (this is super gross, sorry!) sort of probe with the pick of the nail clippers (that thing that flips out with the file on most clippers) to make sure that it wasn't just soft flesh.  Once a little bit of nail came off, I'd trim away.  If it was the entire nail, I just lift off and dig out the nail on the side (gross!), and if it's partial nail, like yours, i clip away with some trauma shears (a nail clipper is fine, i'm sure.)
If it's oozy (yuck) i would tape it while i climbed and then make sure to wear flip flops to work, which my employees loved.  But feet have to get air - it's bad to stick them in your foul shoes all day.  The pain issue is really minimal, and it only takes a couple of days or a week at most for it to look reasonably presentable.  If your foot smells any more or differently than it usually smells, you're in trouble town.  Cheese is not a good smell to be coming from your sock in this case.  So watch for that.
Wow,  this is a gross, sort of weird post.  This is the kind of thing that if I ever become famous or get arrested, the news will read something from this to demonstrate how fucking weird I am.  "He regularly gave advice on foot care on anonymous internet climbing forums."

Last week while warming up at 185 I felt a twinge in my midback and for the rest of the day it was a little sore but fine the next. Then on my next workout day I warmed up at 135 and felt the same thing at the same spot. As I was going through my form checklist, I realized my shoulders were over the bar and causing my back to round a little. I reset, and successfully did my workset with no problems.
 Make sure your shoulders are behind the bar, a little soreness and stiffness is ok.
He wanted to steam his clothes so they would be looking nice for the next day. He turned on the shower and forgot to unplug the drain. We come back 2 hours later to a flooded hotel room. We spent the next hour drying it up with every towel we could find. We told the hotel that our toilet kept on running last night and we didn't know. We didn't have to pay a cent for the damage. The hotel drying up the floor:

 Left shower running, hotel room floods, don't pay anything extra for it
As you've said, DOW1 and 2 are very different games - I personally play both equally, and I'd recommend getting both, price permitting.
In both cases, the latest expansion (i.e. Soulstorm and Retribution) is the most complete version (and more importantly, both are standalone) - so that's all you'd need if you're just playing skirmishes.
So the only unique features of earlier versions are the campaigns. Personally, I found the original DOW1 and Winter Assault campaigns somewhat unpolished - probably not worth your time if you've played any DOW beforehand.
Dark Crusade and Soulstorm have very similar, more generic conquer-the-world campaigns - and if you've played through one, the other won't be too interesting (90% of battles have no story whatsoever). That said, if you haven't played through Dark Crusade's campaign, Soulstorm's campaign is worth at least a once-through.
I would recommend playing all three DOW2 campaigns, on the other hand. Vanilla DOW2 and Chaos rising have some excellent campaigns (CR's is probably my favourite of all), and Retribution's is shorter, but still fun. And of course, Retribution is the version you'll want to play skirmishes on - if just for some sweet 'ultimate' unit action.
 my recommendation:
* Get all three DOW2 versions.
* Soulstorm alone is enough from the original DOW games.
Seeing as though my brother and I are exactly the same difference in age to this comic secretly I was hoping you were my brother writing this (I'm not connected enough to deal :( ) but it turns out you aren't my brother. On a much lighter note, I love toking with my brother. He's such a fun fellow. 
Up tokes for everyone!
Not everyone who delves into watercooling also overclocks their computer. Some do it just because they can. Others do it for lower temperatures (which in turn translates to longevity of components), for a quieter tower, or for an interior that just seems to flow better (sorry for the bad pun).
I put watercooling on my E6750 a year and a half ago simply because I needed a project. I run it at stock settings and made sure to properly leak test it before any components saw a lick of power applied to them.
read up on watercooling before you bash it
I've built water cooled rigs for customers before. I've also had people bring me their adventures in watercooling screw ups. The 200-400 dollars you spend on "OMG IT'Z WATURCUL'D" could buy a damn nice graphics card which will give you the most bang for your buck performance wise. 
Get butthurt and downvote me if you will. I'm not the one with a water damaged motherboard.  (laughingwhores.jpg)
I don't care for Bleach but I leave it on for background noise. Full Metal, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Casshern Sins, and Deadman Wonderland are all pretty fucking good though. I kinda miss Durarara!! but that's because I was too lazy to actually pay attention and finish it. 
Toonami is badass, excluding Bleach.
I usually like to have a good amount on me so when I get a moment of freedom from work and school I can indulge. Last time was about a month ago. I had a bunch of stored psychedelics and invited a few friends over who had never tried DMT. I was going to give them free hits to initiate them into that realm of existence. We started off casual. Played a few games of beer pong, smoked a few bowls, relaxed. (I let each of the first timers take a mild 50mg dose of DMT before drinking or smoking as to not disrupt the effects of the drug) They were astonished and bewildered at the same time. The first timers had maybe had five previous experiences total previous to this night. So, back to the story. I mention that I have a bunch of psychedelics that I have been holding on to for some time now and I have no work the next day. It happened to be a mighty nice coincident that neither did anyone else. I grab a quad of mushrooms and we split that between the five of us. Next, 10 very clean pills (pokeballs of some sort. They are back in Cali :D) We take two each but space them out. Everything is kicking in and I suggest we watch the documentary Ontologica! that was just released for purchase via download the day before. This was the main reason I wanted everyone to come over that night. Fast forward and we're all feeling great experiencing this amazing documentary(with 7.1 surround sound) while hippie flipping and having a nice buzz going. I decide, fuck this documentary is blowing my mind, maybe I should pass some DMT around while we watch this documentary. This was fucking gnarly... the first hit I take and my vision becomes the image of the screen. Everything surrounding my television becomes a gooey mush pot of psychedelia and the screen of the television literally seems to become my minds-eye. I can see it so clearly, my eyes are no longer *looking* at the screen, but they *are* the screen. Everyone else takes their hits and it gets passed back to me. This is where it all happened. This is where my life changed, again, due to psychedelics. I take a second hit, and BAM, I can never unsee this experience. My front-room, friends, furniture and world as I know it become what I can only describe as a scene out of The Matrix. This one to be exact:  (Skip to 2:06, sorry best one I could find)
Anyways, the room turns into what I would describe as "the truth" of our world. It was nothing more then vibrating atoms. My world became a hologram. My friends became holograms, my furniture, fucking holograms! I could see out my house to the beach, the world was a hologram landscape. I blinked hoping it would go back to normal, terrified I had gone somewhere I could never return from. I was scared. This was too much too soon. Why did you show this to me? You are supposed to be gentle. But, behold a new view of our Universe. The world did not return to its beautiful self. The world as we see it through our senses came back after about a minute.
Before this experience, I had read about The Hologram Theory and found it to be plausible in the skeptical sense. Now, now I have experienced it. DMT has never showed me something so regrettably real. I am not left wondering what it all means. I have an answer, or at least I would like to believe it to be one. Either way, it is an answer I am okay with. I live my life now not for anyone but myself. It showed me that **you** are me and **I** am you. Therefore, if I make myself happy I am making you happy. I don't know if this will work for everyone, but bringing joy to others and making the world a better place are things I would like to create during my time here. So, service to myself **IS** service to others. Secondly, I was reassured that everything happening in this world is going accordingly. The good, the bad. The war and the love. It is all necessary. Everything is moving along at just the rate it should be. Things will get better for humans, but only when we create it. First, we must recognize the truth behind our existence. We're all just atoms. The simplicity of these words calm me in any situation. 
** Take bunch of psychedelics, watch mind-blowing documentary, hologram theoried like a motherfucker, initiate revelations of the Universe.**
I agree. Overuse can in fact be more damaging than helpful. My first 2 years of college were filled with heavy use of psychedelics, dissociatives, and MDMA. (Monday Niight Mushrooms, Acid at least weekly, ketamine a few times a week, ate molly constantly) They were just constantly available as everyone I knew sold them and we all went to shows multiple times a week. It was all fun until we pushed the doses too high, too many combos, and too often. 
I became paranoid, withdrawn, socially anxious, depressed, not to mention terrible trips became more and more frequent. 
Its now been a little over a year of little to no use of psychedelics and finally I'm in a good spot. Happier and more comfortable with myself than I have been since I was 14. I still love psychedelics completely, but I can tell the time is not yet right for me to begin exploring again. It may never be time to explore again, which would be highly dissapointing, but I've had my share of them.
Moderation is the key to positivity, overuse can be damaging.
RomneyCare and ObamaCare also differ in that one was a state operation and one is a federal operation. Costs, incurred and all expenses will be spread across all citizens that pay taxes, which will be the middle class because the rich have tax shelters. The middle class is gona bear the brunt of this tax. That sucks!
If I didn't want RomneyCareTax I could move out of Mass. If I don't want ObamaTax, I'd have to leave the country. 
Here' the main points:
* 1: There isn't any way Romney CARES
* 2: False
TLDR - Romney doesn't care.
&gt;audio engineer
So... you looked at a *waveform*, and concluded it was someone speaking. Even though the only things represented in waveforms are lateral time and amplitude, you were able to conclude it was speaking, and were even able extract particular letters.
TL:DR; ITT we have an 'audio engineer' who doesn't understand what a waveform is.
And how do you get *specific letters*, do tell? Since the audio signature of one person saying an 'f' could very well look like the signature of someone else saying a 'g' or a 'z' or 'three' or any number of other things.
Also, in your example, the top could still *definitely* be a waveform of someone speaking, or singing, with simple volume modulation. 
TL:DR; Wouldn't it be easier to just admit you were bullshitting?
People are telling you to read the FAQ.  You should, but here is an actual answer.  
You really need to concentrate on the calories and protein.  If you said that 2000 calories was not enough, then eat more.  I know it sounds like a generic answer, but it really is the only answer.  Bump it up to 2500 a day, see how that goes.  
Obviously, you don't want eat 2500 calories of glazed donuts a day.  You need to consider what else is in the items you eat that are high calories.  Are you eating/drinking any whey protein?  I suggest you do.  There is a section in the FAQ that talks about how much protein you should be eating.  Read it.
Develop a goal of Calories AND protein per day that you want to eat.  If you continue to not gain weight, then you obviously need to intake more.
In regards to your original question.  I promise that you will not see a major increase in fat if you eat right and work out.  Do not half ass your workouts.  Really give it all you have everytime.  Once you have put on 10-15 lbs and you get a better understanding of what you can/should eat, then you can make the decision on the direction you want to go.
Here are things you should include in your daily diet that will help you:
  * Chicken(grilled)
  * Nuts(almonds, peanuts, peanut butter)
  * Milk
  * Cottage cheese
  * Greek yogurt
  * bananas
  * Eggs
  * Whey protein
  * Pasta
  * Potatoes
- Just eat man.  COUNT CALORIES.  
If you're on top you should be able to control the depth and rhythm of te thrusting so pain boulder be an issue
That's my 2 cents anyway
- ride him
Whoops. Well here's what I'd recommend. Play less ARAM and more jungle. Since you seem to want to jungle, pick three champions that you like to jungle and starting jungling those champs in every normal game you can. Give it a week or two, then roll back around to ranked.
Practice with junglers if you want to get better at jungle.
I'm just gonna throw this non-answer out.  How are you going to deal with the people who get annoyed with you multiple times every day because they have to wait longer for you to restart and accelerate away from traffic lights.    
 You save 4 cents daily while costing others much more.
Depends what kind of shape you are in.  I did it for a month going from no form of exercise for over a year to insanity, and I ended up with a few injuries.  My hip flexor is still strained but for some reason it only hurts if i stretch and I'm okay doing squats still.
I lost a lot of weight doing insanity, and it got me back in the 'mood' of working out and being healthy.
  It's great for cutting, just be careful because it's easy to injure your knees/hips/groin.
I think the idea is that dyed hair is more of a commitment than, say, breakfast. Granted, not a huge one, but you can't color your hair twice in one day without it being fried all to hell.  And it's safe to say that it's way more expensive and that it can be a bitch to go back to the original color.
And specifically adopting traits of other people your s/o is attracted to just seems like the mark of insecurity to me. Say your ex was a redhead; if your current gal dyed her hair to match, wouldn't that seem a little creepy?
 I think this *would*, despite OP's original intent, be more fitting with OAG.
I like Karma as much as anyone, but she really isn't anywhere near as good as you make her out to be.  
Her sustain is pretty awful.  At level 1 it heals for about 65 hp, and you can only use it 2 times a minute until level 7.  At level 5 it does about 180 2 times every 50 seconds.  
Compare to soraka who heals for about 70 at level 1 and can do it 3 times a minute, and at 5 its 350 3 times a minute.  Alistar at level 1 is 60 and its 5 times a minute and at level 5 it's 180 5 times a minute.
Soraka's heal might not be AoE but it's still much higher heals and it gives the huge armor boost which negates a ton of damage if used correctly.
So karma's sustain is far from great, the damage aspect of her Q is decent, but it's such short range that there is a good chance that if you're trying to poke with it than most of the time you're going not going to outdamage the incoming trade.  Than if you try to use your shield for more poke than lose your ability to sustain.
So the problem karma has in lane is she has the choice of being an aggresive poker with maxing her shield or a mediocre sustainer by maxing Q.  You can't really be both at the same time.  
The only support role she plays well is aggressive poker, but still I'd put alistar and leona above her in terms of aggressive supports.  She also falls off really hard lategame if you build her as a support as without items her damage and heals are pretty negligible late, and she has no utily.
So I really disagree that she can just as powerful as the more common supports, the difference between karma mid and other mids is much smaller than karma support and other supports actually in my opinion.
Although with all that said play who you want, as long as you support your AD and don't just spam Q or E and steal all his farm it doesn't really matter.
Also orianna is great, people are just sceptical that people in solo Q can play her so they don't give people the benefit of the doubt.
 Karma support is pretty mediocre.  Though just pick what you want to play, play according to that role and if you do well ignore the haters.  If you do poorly, think about their objections and factor that in next time you pick the hero.

I see and appreciate what you're saying but I'm less generous with my assessment of how well they fixed things. I'll go along your list though for coherence:
&gt; plotholes with the crew and the Normandy
technically, yeah, but it was so half-assed. Saying "Oh, the Normandy flew in" covers up the raw issue of how the squad got back on but it also kills the momentum of the ending, essentially hitting the pause button on the battle. They traded one flaw for another.
&gt; Relays exploding and everybody starving to death
Also poor coherence with the rest of the plot. Throughout the whole series we're reminded of how advanced the Relay networks are. ME1 has the Protheans, consistently acknowledged as technologically beyond the races of Shepard's time, being barely able to unlock Mass Relay Technology. This is fixed with the again half-assed line of "oh, we can totally fix them. At best the controlled Reapers do it, but what about the Destroy ending?
&gt; The divine nature of the starchild
How is this really changed? I doubt anyone ever thought of the Starchild as God prior to the EC. He's still the exact same puppetmaster he was before. What always made me mad about this was the fact that the Reapers, the enemy with which the player had spent enough time with to actually develop a relationship, were suddenly and completely robbed of their agency, reduced literally to mindless animals. And here's this new fucker which gets to have his cake and eat it too: He's been involuntarily changed by the Crucible, susceptible to new alternatives and without the ability to make the choice himself (it falls on Shepard), yet at the same time the only choices available are the ones he lays out, and if you reject them he can force upon Shepard a new iteration of the cycle. He can't stop you, yet if you don't play his little game you're robbed of all choice? Huh?
&gt; Showing properly what the different choices represent
In a raw sense, yes they did fix this, but it's tied in to what I just said. The choices are fixed, not always coherent in and of themselves, and Shepard can't act like he has throughout the series (neither a Paragon or Renegade would accept these choices at face value) or look for new alternatives? Doesn't fit.
&gt; Providing closure
For the characters, yes. For the overarching Reaper plot, not really. You get a vague sense of what the Reapers are/where they came from, but not enough for closure. What about the keepers? What about the origins of the Relay Network? More about the cycle of extinction? Will we ever have access to the information about past species supposedly preserved by the Reapers, thus justifying genocide? And so on.
&gt; The Crucible being a giant MacGuffin...
Certainly not fixed.
Finally, I think the Reaper threat could very easily have been solved better. You're right in that we were beaten over the head with the fact that the Reapers were unstoppable conventionally, which is why I really hate how ME3 plunges us from minute one into a conventional war full of conventional war thinking. 
Personally, I would have had the Reapers beeline for the Citadel instead of Earth (why did they go for Earth anyway?) at the beginning, like they did with the Protheans and presumable every previous cycle. As fits with their MO and common sense anyway, they would have shut down the Relay Network like they did for the Protheans, et al, isolating most of the galaxy from itself and leaving it open to Reaper conquest. However the Normandy, having the wonderful and intelligent EDI as well as a Reaper IFF from ME2, finds a way to rig it so the Relays will think the Normandy is a Reaper, making it the only ship in the galaxy capable of using the Network except Reapers. Cue a high stakes race against time where Shepard has to find a way to unite a scared and divided galaxy both in spirit, convincing them that the end is not nigh, and technologically, duplicating the IFF so more ships can make it through. Ultimately, I would have Shepard make a dangerous run to the Citadel, by now full of indoctrinated inhabitants, to implement a newly discovered reversal of the Relay lockout, preventing the now deployed Reaper fleets from using the Network while allowing the rest of the galaxy to do so. The Reapers are defeated by being slowly swarmed a few at a time by the galaxy's fleets. 
Shit, I know that isn't a perfect story but I think it's a lot better than the "find us the biggest guns you can" BS we got in ME3.
I love me some Mass Effect, but I think ME3 didn't live up to the series.
You should have read wittolboy's post. You basically just d it.
I don't have any more experience than being an enthusiastic amateur. I wanted to recapture, in part, the thrill of the Heinlein books I grew up with like *Have Spacesuit, Will Travel* and *Tunnel in the Sky* which made engineering and physics sexy.
When I started reading about [Copenhagen Suborbitals]( I got super psyched because they make it seem possible. I drastically telescoped the time frame to make things more dramatic, but I based a lot of it on their tests and the possibly erroneous conclusion that what's holding them back from LEO are safety considerations, a whole lot of good laws, and the size of their launch vehicles. If you could strap their Tycho Brache spacecraft to a really, really huge set of hybrid rockets, and you had unlimited man power, deep pockets, and a core of people who had no consideration for their personal safety, would LEO be attainable? For the purposes of this book, I decided "Yes." 
I grew up in South Carolina (where this book is set) and spent a lot of time with some older guys who would build boats, surfboards, bombs, rebuild cars, and all that kind of thing and so I grew up thinking that if you had the right tools, and enough commitment, you could do anything from scratch.
**TL,DR** - no, I don't have any practical experience, but I extrapolated from the little I know, and my own beliefs.
30,000 x 150 = 4,500,000. If you can't get it done for less than that you're doing it wrong.
"Western customers demand high-quality, color-printed, hardcover books for their courses, so that is what we print, and the price does increase a bit. " 
Source for this please. I counter this statement by saying that many students would be happy with gray-scale on pulp or digital delivery.
"And, for those of you who complain that texts no longer resell well, that is partially the result of demand from your bookstores and professors who also demand a new publishing date to cover their asses."
Source for this please. I've never heard of this before and I question what "ass covering" the bookstore &amp; professors are trying to do.
"Part of this plan relies on the fact that Western demand in stronger economies keeps the texts in production, while those international copies do not come back in and force the publisher to compete with itself in the countries driving textbook development."
Long story short, Western students are subsiding the cost for students in weaker economies. 
"We would go out of a business within the year if we tried selling $6 texts to all students..."
Then you would be replaced by someone who _could_ do it for that price. Why do we as a society need to give the publisher an ironclad guarantee that they can continue making enough money to stay profitable? This is the same argument that the *IAA has been making for years and it's no better for publishers than it is for them.
I understand "pricing to market" but in today's global economy it's not just the companies who have the privilege of doing business overseas. Consumers also have the right to import goods from other markets, after all those same companies seem to have no compulsion about shipping our JOBS to those places!
Same tired arguments used by the media companies and for the same reasons.
At this point I'd mention that you'd feel better if he didn't steal your wedding theme from you. It's one thing to shove his wedding in before yours but it's another to steal the theme. 

It's like you saving up for a sweet NERF gun, and him just going out and buying it right away. 
- Either don't let it bother you or just don't go to his after party. Just go to the wedding and leave. 
Nu and core are part of metal, by definition. They evolved from it. You may not like it, but if you start saying they're not metal, you'll have to exclude Folk metal, Symphonic metal, SID metal, etc.... Basically anything that mixes it with another genre. Hell, there's an acapella band in Germany covering metal songs, they don't even have guitars and you would still consider them metal because of their sound.    
Hard Rock on the other hand is part of rock, somewhere between Rock and classic Heavy Metal. The new wave of british heavy metal evolved from it, but it is generally seen as Rock.      
TL,DR: Those who evolved from metal are trüe.
Metal is a type of heavy modern rock music derived from blues rock. It's primary instruments are electric guitars, drums and vocals. The guitars are drop and/or downtuned, and the drums and vocals tuned to match. The primary type of distortion used is overdrive, although further distortion effects can be used.
Tritones are common, as is atonality and dissonance.
The beat is not like those used in rock, or the suffled beats of jazz and blues. Blastbeats and similar complicated drumming is common, but not essential.
There is no specified rhythm, melody or tempo. Other instruments may be used.
Unlike in rock, there is a constant sonic assault. This combined with the beat, tuning distortion and type of chords used gives the unique heaviness.
Genres that only have only some of these characteristics are subject to extensive internet arguments; how many of these characteristics are required for a genre to be metal? Genres such as nu metal and -core and bands such as Tool and Karnivool do not have all of these characteristics. IMO, all of the above characteristics are necessary for a band to be metal.
 Metal is a type of heavy music were the heaviness is produced in a particular way.

You can ask a dozen different metalheads that and get a dozen different answers, for all it's camaraderie metal is a very divisive genre. Perhaps that's because metal actually isn't that well defined.
As with most things in life there is black, there is white and then there is grey, it obviously very easy to distinguish between, say, Pink Floyd and Metallica as to which one is metal but the thing about music is it's ever changing, ever evolving and it has a tendency to cross genre borders. I guess a simple answer, though, would be aggression. Arguably that is metal's signature, it tends to be loud, fast, heavy and (on the odd occasion) dark but I don't think you can get much more specific than that, and this isn't unique to metal either this is the case with most genres (try having this discussion about prog rock etc.), but to try and define metal any further is to likely fall prey to a number of fallacies.
One notion I particularly dislike is that of "true" metal. I won't go into huge detail here but I would urge you, anytime you hear someone use that term (and not just for metal either), to view their arguments with suspicion. To say that any form of music is the "true" representation of any genre is both ignorance and arrogance of the highest order, there is no true representation of any form of music. All music, all genres have a genesis and then they evolve, they take influences from other genres, other styles and they adapt them (to varying degrees of success). 
Metal's roots, as with rock, lie in blues. If you really wanted to you could argue that Robert Johnson is the godfather of metal, indeed, back in his day he was reported to have made a deal with the devil in order to get his guitar playing skills (how metal is that?) but I would be wary. In summary, metal is many things, different styles with different inspirations and no real clear definition. Just the way it should be.
 Robert Johnson is the godfather of metal.
I see that most people are talking about the technical musical aspect of the genre here (And quite honestly I have no fucking idea what most of it means! :P)
Let me go on a different tack here and say that "heavy" is a FEELING, a quality that happens use the techniques, chords, song structure etc mentioned to get that FEELING across.
Lets take black sabbath, the band and song. That song is heavy as fuck, ozzy's wail, the sludgy guitars, the drumming, all add up to convey a sense of dread and forlornness. Me personally, I really lock onto that. It moves me. I find it heavy. It has a "metallic" sound. Heavy metal.
By the same token, let's look at Anthrax. Happy cheerful songs, but still aggressive. The riffs, drumming, joeys soaring vocals, frank's bass..gets me so fucking pumped. Once again, It moves me, it's heavy. Once again, Heavy metal.
Now we'll use the oft cited example in this discussion, Slipknot. Loud distorted guitars, thumping bass, fast drumming, harsh vocals..but they leave me flat. They may have a "metallic" sound, they may be hard, but they don't move me at all. I just don't find them heavy.
 I can't really go into more depth about what I dislike about them, not least because i avoid listening to them but because I don't have the musical knowledge to properly analyse it. I don't know art but I know what I like I suppose.
Now I'll throw a curveball.
Go listen to pornography by the cure. It's a heavy album. I'd say it's equal to My Dying Brides as the flower withers. It's not a "metal" album by any stretch of the imagination, but fuck it's heavy. Gets me going where sipknot or pantera leave me totally flat.
Heavy is a feeling, Metal is a sound, Music with the sound but lacking the feel is not what most people who consider themsleves metal are looking for.


Cyberpunk fiction, **good** cyberpunk fiction, has always had, for me anyway, enough of the world around me to make it real, but enough imagination and added nuance to make it inviting and inspiring.
The aesthetic has to be just so: decaying slums where even the ubiquitous futuristic technology is cobbled together with the leftovers of the world above, neon signs shorting out as punks spill out of the bars long past last call. When the sun rises, elegant high rises catch the first light, these where the revered corporate heads and top scientific minds live, they have their own tram system and shopping centers from which they look down on the derelict underclass, aloof to their misery.
I like the distinct factions that are often present in cyberpunk fiction, you see it a lot in Shadowrun, but even in Deus Ex: Human Revolution there are the different factions of Detroit and Hengsha.
As a genre, its core basis is that our world will always be the way it is just to a different degree. Advanced technology won't solve everything, we won't cure cancer, or create a patch for every problem with the human genome, and then suddenly everyone will be happy and peaceful and equal. Governments change, become more oppressive, or give more power to corporations. Superpowers shift, maybe the Japanese tech industry forces the west to adopt the yen, or Chinese pharmaceutical companies outsource their work to the US. There is always inequality, it's a constant in cyberpunk, crime and rebellion are inextricably linked as well.
* I guess what I'm driving at is that it gives me a lot to think about and articulate, aesthetically and intellectually. It's inspiring to me and I hope someday to create stories and worlds with such richness and texture as the best cyberpunk stories. Also lots of cool technology that I would want to have in life. I don't think the tablet is quite ready yet, hopefully they stop treating them like giant phones and come up with better OSes than Android and iOS.
It sounds like you're relying on these girls too much.  While they probably should at least say goodbye, I know from experience that it's sometimes really difficult to decide if you should keep talking to someone you've been romantically involved with once you find someone else.  It's made even harder when that person *needs* you because you'll hurt them even more if you stop talking to them and they're way more likely to hurt you and the new relationship if you keep talking to them.  
They might be trying to decide if they want to talk to you or not and you relying on them while cybering with them makes the choice harder.
reminds me of when my family used to do fireworks. Sometimes the neighborhood would come to watch because we used to spend a good amount on em but one fateful day some prick called the police, and they showed up right before we lit the last finale one. They let us off with a warning and said if we did anymore we would get fined [](/okay)
hasn't felt the same since 
we still keep that last one on our mantle as a reminder
TL:DR: Family loves fireworks, neighbors jelly, police called, no more fireworks, state laws suck
It derives primarily from poor map design.   Players that find losing undesirable and then leave also add to the problem. 
TLDR maps suck and people care too much about their stats.  
When I play without my dudes, shit sucks man.  Always lose.
When I play with my dudes, your shit's going down man.  We always win.
  get dudes.  you win.  
disclaimer:  we win like 1 out of 6 times on rush maps with greater than 100% tickets.  totally feel.  

I've been an atheist since my senior year of high school and I'm about to go into my senior year of college. I am still dependent on my parents for a bit longer and I have decided not to say a damn thing to them. My parents would probably immediately cut me off if they found out. When I go to grad school I'll be paying for everything myself and that's when they'll know. When discussing church-going while I'm at college, I say that I'm so busy, that Sunday is my only day to relax (which isn't a lie). When I go home, I still "pray" with them and rarely go to church with them. If religious debates arise (usually pertaining to science or politics), I choose my words very carefully to still defend my current opinion without offended theirs and without giving away that I don't think that way anymore.
- I've been hiding it for almost 4 years and won't tell them until I'm independent from them.
Holy hell, I was relaxing on the grass at the park today reading One flew over the cuckoos nest, I look down and see a beatle on my lap, I try shoving the son of a bitch with my water bottle but he didn't budge and I could've sworn the saum' bitch hissed at me! Holy hell good thing I had earphones on 
earphones save lives
This happened to me on the 4th as well, when I was 7(19 years ago). Mine was a japanese beetle. 
I fell asleep during the fireworks, and woke up in immense pain. All I could do is scream "There's a bug in my ear!" until my parents believed and took me to the ER. The admissions nurse looked at my mother and I like we had 3 heads when we told her, and was kind of a huge bitch.
Sweet justice: after the doc pulled the gigantic beetle out of my ear, my mom asked if she could have it, then walked out to show it to the admissions nurse, who then apologized.  Love you mom!
 We're ear beetle buddies.
I was mowing the grass when I was about 13. A moth flew up out of the grass and right into my ear. It took a few minutes to process what happened. When I did, I started freaking out. My Mom took me to the ER and I was FREAKING out. The moth was fluttering inside my ear and I couldn't get past the fact that there was a bug flapping around in my ear. There's a bonus to the story as well. I get in to the doctor and they use a water pick to blast that fucker out of there. It comes out, dead, and there are a bunch of small, white balls accompanying the moth... They were eggs. It was pregnant and it released eggs in my ear. When I got home I poured rubbing alcohol into my ear and let it sit. Still makes me shiver thinking about it...

- Moth flies into ear, go to ER, blast it out with water, find out it had laid eggs in there.
Back in high school, when I had long hair, I was walking home from the bus stop when a bee landed on my head and for some reason started burrowing into my hair. After about 5 minutes(not exaggerating at all) of screaming and flailing and trying to get this buzzing demonic Satan bee out my hair I finally decide to just smash the thing, this killed the bee. After a while I was able to scratch out all of the pieces of the bee and I got a buzz cut the next day.
 Fuck long hair and bees
Okay so, i went fishing one time with my dad. I was probably around 4. I went to go take a piss behind a tree real quick. I came out screaming and yelling. My dad couldnt figure out what was wrong so he took me to the ER the entire ride there every few minutes i would start twitching and freaking out as this rather large unknown insect was flapping its wings in my ear. I arrive at the doctor and he insists repeatedly that there is absolutely nothing in there. He continues to attempt to drown whatever it was in there. It tried to back its way out and drowned. All i heard was "there is nothing in there i assure you there is noth....oh my god". It turns out that it was a flying ant about 3/4 of an inch long that was hiding behind my ear drum and was flapping its wings because apparently I was the one pissing HIM off... i got to keep it.
got fucked in the ear by the ant.
to start:  you're right to feel hurt here.  No one likes to get ignored or passed over, especially in their time of need.  don't beat yourself up for it.  he screwed up but it's important that you forgive him and work together on this.  neither of you can do it on your own and you need to be roughly on the same level of communication ability to make things work.  these things are difficult sometimes, but *you can do it*, and you can do it **together.**
first off, it sounds like your jealousy is more of an insecurity issue, and given his actions, you have every right to feel that way.  **feelings are not illogical.**
* pin down the events that made you feel bad, and be specific.  in this case, "you didn't get the love and attention that you needed" is pretty easy to spot.
* second, figure out what you both could have done to fix it, and do this together.  in this case, you communicating your emotional needs more clearly and him listening to your needs is what should have happened.  Try not to place the blame solely on one person and be constructive.  Remember, always be positive.  
* figure out what you both can do to learn from this mistake and avoid it in the future.  in this case, you communicating your needs more clearly and directly (in a positive manner), while the even is small and manageable, would be step one (ex: "I need hugs plz").  him *immediately* giving you all the comfort you need and his undivided attention until you feel better is step two.  (ex: k.  love^love^love^love^love^love^love^love^love )
* once you identified how to avoid these things in the future, work on what you need to do to feel better *now.*  I'm guessing a few days or weeks of attention from him, either things like going out and having adventures or having snuggley cuddles or sex or whatever it takes is on the menu. this doesn't mean you two need to stop talking to the other people, just that you need to put the phone down for a little while.  have him send the girl a "hey, i'm going to be afk for a while.  gotta snuggle the lady! :D" or something similar (and *positive*) would be all it takes.  
you both staying positive is so it's easier everyone gets the love and affection they need to be happy.  everything you do should be constructive and positive.  it's not always tough, but it gets easier with practice.
you can do it.  :)
 no one plans for accidents, so don't beat yourself or him up for it.  forgive him, then the two+ of you work to resolve it together.  communicate your needs when they're small and easy to fix, and listen to each other when those needs are communicated.  learn from your mistakes and don't make rash decisions.  
As Lorgramoth said, this isn't really a make/break thing for me, but I would love to see an option for a Unified Rome campaign much like RTR, Europa Barbarorum, and XGM. The 3 Roman Houses + Senate may be fun, but I really want my game to be as historically accurate as possible when I play through it and having the option to sack both Carthage and Corinth in the same year to take control of the Med. Sea would be awesome. 
Oh, and the Pyrrhic Wars. I would LOVE to see the game start a few years before the [Pyrrhic Wars]( That was something which was left out of the first game which really should have been in there because it cemented Rome's significance in the Western Med. 

Plus they were somewhat allied with Carthage in that time and I would love to see that alliance quickly begin to deteriorate until the First Punic War begins.
I want to see an option for a Unified Rome campaign which allows you to start the game with Rome vs. Epirus in the Pyrrhic Wars. 
Ooops, I wrote a novel. This is what your post reminded me of. Your guy sounds like a lying dog anyway, and you're better off.
Alright I'm just going to throw this out here. I had a friend recently. He became a good friend that I saw several times a week (totally platonic so it's slightly different but stay with me). He has some unspecified mood and personality disorders. He's not stable, or happy more of the time. He had trouble holding down a job. He held a lot of grudges for perceived slights against him by people in his life.
But it wasn't directed at me. I was able to dodge his ire. I specifically knew how to cater to his emotional state so that I wouldn't set him off. I was walking on eggshells, but I didn't really see it that way. I was just being sensitive to his quirks, being a good friend. I don't like to upset people anyway, but I usually didn't have to be ultra-conscientious in order to not upset them. With him I did. I held my tongue a Lot, because he had many wrongheaded ideas about the nature of reality but it wasn't worth upsetting him.
I really and truly had never crossed him in our 6 month friendship. In fact, I more or less conducted our friendship entirely on his terms. I helped him out financially. I treated him. I tried to use my resources to help him find work, I tried to motivate and encourage him to follow through with leads (we're in the same field and work is fairly plentiful in it).
One day, I offered to clean up his quasi-hoarder pig sty of an apartment. He had empties and half-empties on every horizontal surface of his place and I offered to collect them and throw them in the dumpster on my way out. (I am, compared to many people, a relative clean freak and so I'd rather do it myself than remain in a gross place. For example, my SO's car accumulates paper waste that I regularly remove because it bothers me before it bothers him and it's not really any skin off my back to just take it out with me.) My friend has some odd craziness related to not feeling like he could take it out himself, nor did he want to let me take it out. He literally said that he couldn't think about taking out the trash in his place until after he had settled into his new job he had started a couple weeks prior. This is the first time I ever argued a point with him, really. I just said, I don't see how starting a new job and letting me grab these bottles and throw them away are mutually exclusive? I'm just trying to help you out and it would make me more comfortable if I didn't have to think about knocking over 20 oz of week old brass monkey when I walk to the bathroom.
My friend threw me out of his apartment. Defriended me on fb. I tried to smooth things over text and he said he was unwilling to discuss it further. It was one of the most shocking moments of my social life to date. I've never had a friend just break contact like that with me. And I knew that he had the same weird perceptions of me and is out there carrying a grudge for how things went down between us. I'm the bad guy in his eyes. His crazy eyes.
So that was like a month ago. My life has improved like 5 fold since he "dumped" me as a friend. Other friends that have weighed in on it were like "he is crazy, and he acted crazy what did you expect?" Another friend told me I was codependent and when I looked into it, it described our friendship to a T. All of my helping. All of my concern. All of my tiptoeing around him. It wasn't a real friendship. I got very little emotional support or anything satisfying on a friendship level besides sometimes humorous company. What satisfaction I did get was from "helping" and feeling like he needed me or I was improving his life with my friendship. And some of that help was exerting control, like trying to live his life because I could do it better than he was for himself. So it's not just him that's crazy, the dynamic that brought us together was sick. I didn't see it until he broke it off. And now, if he wanted to be friends again I'd tell him sorry but our friendship was never healthy and my life is better without you in it. I don't give a shit if he thinks I'm awful. I'm grateful he involuntarily freed me from our shitty friendship.
you shouldn't care what wrongheaded beliefs someone who is so clearly unhealthy for you holds.
here's the point of view from within the closet (granted, i do not live in the western world, so the societal pressures are different):
i needed almost two years and two boyfriends before i reach the point where i am looking for rented place to live together with my SO. but i have not told my family or friends, and as i see, my friends will learn from facebook before the family.
now, about your relationship. not hearing or seeing for weeks is weird. this is a separate issue from being in the closet. if it is going to work, you need to see each other more often.
two: i work in a very quiet environment, so i generally keep my phone on silent. but when the lunch break comes, i return the phone calls of my boyfriend. i do not care if and what my coworkers would hear, he is more important than them. i do not get the vibe that this guy puts you in a high regard from your message.
by the way, my ex-bf was a total asshole but he helped me come to my senses simply by living. i witnessed that his everyday life was little affected by the fact that he is out.
so i gradually actepted the fact that the coming out does not hurt :) if you want to help your guy, just show him your life. meet him with your bi/gay friends and most importantly, with hetero people who he knows they know you are bi. let this penetrate his skin and sink in his mind. oh, did i mention that you need to see each other more often? and not just cuddling in his place watching movies.
***: dating in the closet is possible but needs more effort. but your relationship has other issues which the closet makes worse. if i have mis-read the situation, prepare for a long wait until your guy is ready. best luck!
hyperbole is using the example of insane speech on the internet by some individual to prove free speech.  think about organized protest movements like occupy which actually threaten the elites.  some lone crazy isnt a threat but protests on the streets are.  which is why they got put down violently by police and demonized in the media.   
 the clash is right
And "Slavery by Another Name" by an amazing ex-editor or the WSJ. He singlehandedly uncovered the systematic continuation of slavery after the civil war by criminilization of black life and resulting "penal" slavery. A black man could talk too loud in the street in Alabama in 1930 and end up dying in a prison labor camp (contracted out to a private company) 15 years later.
I think it won a Pulitzer.
tl;dr
Slavery did not end in America until World War II. Read the book!
Sure, me too. My biggest problems are with Superman, Cyborg and Flash.
Superman's costume is classic, impressive, and very clean and simple, which is part of what made it so iconic. I feel like you lose that with the redesign. The loose trousers and the jacket-like top reduce  the simplicity, and I think, look less working class and more militaristic,  which is absolutely the last thing Superman should look. Also, the short cape is lame and kinda sad-looking. 
I got the feeling I understood Cyborg a lot different than the artist. The story of Cyborg, starting with him being horrified and self-hating because of his prostheses, and then eventually coming to terms with them and helping children with the same challenges, is a good one. I greatly prefer it as an origin to "diseased nerd wants to be a superhero, gives himself cybernetics and becomes one". As well, I just like the original design better. One of Original Vic's challenges is the way people treat him because of his looks, as he is mostly metal. New Vic is just a dude with a robot arm and eye. 
Not too much to say about the Flash, I actually really like his story redesign, and his body looking more like a runner. But, it's my least favourite outfit, I just think it's really really ugly. The grey mesh, the helmet, the unbroken onesie. On a purely personal aesthetic level, I hate it. 
- Overall, I think the redesign is too focused on "realism" and making the costumes more complicated than they should be. Superhero comics are stylised, that's part of the appeal for me. Yeah, no one would actually fight in that, but it looks freakin' cool. In the DC universe, the new costumes are boring and kind of drab. In an original superhero comic where more detailed and realistic costumes were the norm, these would be great. But they don't fit the Justice League for me. 
honestly, the key to multiclassing in 3.5 is to not do it. it's a trap unless you really know what you're doing. 
when you multiclass you give up higher-level abilities in exchange for more diverse lower-level ones. if you're a primary spellcaster this is basically never worth it, as spell power increases exponentially with levels. for other classes it varies. rangers and rogues get some nice abilities at higher levels and want to think twice before multiclassing. fighters get nothing special at higher levels and can muticlass more easily.
the one time when multiclassing is recommended is when it feeds into a prestige class that is designed to meld two classes. if you want to be a thief that can hold his own in melee, and there's a prestige class which melds the two by continuing your sneak attack progression while granting a full BAB, then you can muticlass for a few levels to qualify. 
a set-up where you end up with Class A - 2 (levels) / Class B - 3 / Prestige Class - 10, where you use multiclassing to enter a prestige class can be good. a set-up with Class A - 3 / Class B - 12 where you're mostly Class B but have a smattering of Class A can be good. a set-up like Class A - 7 / Class B - 8, where you evenly split your advancement, is typically terrible and will lead to a weak character that does nothing particularly well. 
the history of 3.5 is littered with terrible characters due to mutliclassing, where they would have been better off staying single-classed and using skills and feats or simply roleplaying to achieve variety. i'm currently playing a halfling sorcerer who is sneaky and likes to catch enemies by surprise - if i was less exerienced i'd probably have taken a few levels of rogue to reflect this and he'd be a hell of a lot weaker. instead i've spent skill ranks on stealth (pathfinder), chosen some sneaky spells, and roleplayed him as sneaky and ambushy. i play him like a sorcerer/rogue while mechanically he benefits from being straight sorcerer.
**- don't muticlass unless you know what you're doing, or if everyone else in the party will be weak too. multiclassing has the potential to greatly weaken your character, which is no fun if other characters aren't also similarly subpar.**
Let me tell you about the Borg.
No-one knows where they come from, what their origin is. Any trace of their history beyond a few thousand years in the past is completely inaccessible.
They're probably native to the Delta Quadrant, but no-one knows for sure. They might even be extragalactic in origin, or come from a different timeline or universe entirely.
We *think* that they organize themselves under Queens, but the details are not well known. For all we know the hive-mind could have been fucking with Picard and Data throughout First Contact. They are a truly inhuman intellect, with a "body" spread across thousands of star systems and millions of worlds.
No-one knows just how many Borg drones there are, but their absolute lower limit numbers in the trillions - probably many, many times that.
The only thing we know for certain is that their stated goal is to assimilate the biological and technological progress of other species to theirs.
Despite their undeniably powerful ships, they have never sent more than a few ships at a time to attack the Federation. A single Borg cube devastated the Federation fleet at Wolf 359, and another very nearly broke through the best defenses the Federation could muster to defend Earth.
In either case, had the Borg sent two cubes, or a dozen, or a hundred, humanity would have been overcome and assimilated. No question about it. In fact, the only species we've seen pose a significant threat to the Borg was the Undine - and they are the dominant race of what is essentially a pocket universe.
In short, if the Borg wanted to destroy the Federation, the KDF, every dominant race in the Alpha Quadrant, they could. If they wanted to assimilate every sentient being from Earth to Qonos, it would take them a matter of years on the outside, maybe as little as months or weeks if things went well.
This leads to the conclusion that the Borg do not *want* to destroy the Federation or its neighbors. They attack worlds and assimilate ships or colonies, but never seriously press an attack against Earth.
The Borg are not an implacable enemy, a foe reaching inward to snuff out the heart of Starfleet. They are a farmer harvesting a ripened crop. They "threaten" humanity, spurring cultural and technological development, and then reap the rewards every time they assimilate a Federation ship or acquire new drones.
Perhaps they've done this many times in the past, sending out a token force; if the force is not repelled, then the culture was obviously not strong enough to be worth nurturing, and will provide a useful source of drones. But if that expedition is forced back, token as it may be, then the Borg know that they have found a source of possible value, a seed that can grow into a worthy source of innovation.
** The Federation survives because the Borg want humanity to progress and grow, so new technologies and cultural concepts can be assimilated. The Borg are farming humanity.**
I had a situation at a pick-up game that caused tempers to flare.
While on defense, my man cuts deep (I am trailing by ~3 feet) and the handler throws a full field huck. In a brief second, I look up the disc and get a general idea of where the disc is going to land. 
I look down on the field and see an open lane to where I think the disc will land.
However, my defender initially misread the disc (which is what opened up my lane to the disc) and then while I am looking down while sprinting, he makes a sharp cut into my lane.
Our feet get tangled and we both fall down to the ground while the disc falls 10 feet in front of us.
He called the foul and I contested on the grounds that he wasn't going for the disc but was in fact bodying me out.  
However, it brings up an interesting point;  I contested the play on the premise that he wasn't going for the disc while subsequently blocking me from getting to the disc. However, I don't think he intended to cut me off, he just misread the disc, cut into my lane to the disc, and our feet got tangled.
***
The rules of Ultimate are vague when dealing with fouls.  Sometimes it is hard to determine the intentions of others and you naturally assume the worst.

Eek, kinda late reply. I won't go into great detail about either of them, it'd take forever.
The first one is in a world called Kova. It's basically a land created by a goddess named Iriue, who also created a order (called the Astrilogical Ordinis) to control and keep peace. The elements all are equal in power, and when one is disrupted, bad things happen. Kova is divided into several different places (called dimensions). It's really awesome. My favorite character is the Empress, cause she has the power of darkness and aura (aura, being the power to change powers and control things.) and also because she's just plain awesome. 
The other is a mirror world of Earth called Chaos, that has 8 different plains (think of Oblivion from the elder scrolls franchise.) Each plain is ruled by a "Note Lord". The eight plain is where the members of the Staff are, along with the two rulers of Cleff. You can only enter/leave Chaos by mirrors. The mortals on Earth can awaken their inner Chaos by channeling their worst fears into pure power. So the main characters in this have done this, and also have some type of odd gift bestowed upon them by the Staff. It's basically a very musical Oblivion. Haha. 
I have no idea how I thought of either of them, but I'll often pretend to actually be them. And narrate everything. My parents think im nuts! xD. I also have an alter ego, who is a blue haired cat person with an awesome jacket and cape. I am often plain as her in reality, and it's fun. 
 I have too big of an imagination. Meow. 
The fact that you admit that you do it and it's complexity shows that you are not at all mentally I'll, but just creative.      
Writr the goddamn book, we want to read it. 
You probably shouldn't ever tell her, why would you? But also, why not tell her? If your answer is: because she might think I'm a freak then you probably shouldn't. Why does she need to know? It's kinda irrelevant to your marriage. But if if it'll add to your relationship then by all means.
You're questioning your sanity but it just seems to me that you have an odd hobby. If anything, it says something about your intelligence, and it being fairly high if you're able to maintain a whole encyclopedia of a fictional land that can be recalled whenever you beckon it. 
You created a land where you are god, it's amusing to you so who cares?
Tl:dr: fuck tramps, acquire currency?
Dude are you serious? This is breaking like 2 rules in one. 
First, the image isn't gaming related, the mods have posted like 4 times NOT to post anything where the picture isn't gaming related. Second this is a blatant repost from multiple places, [here]( and [here]( for example. That's pretty lame man, it's a pretty dick move to steal someone's idea and take all the credit.

 WHOLE REPOST IS BABIES
I started disliking EA after they ruined the need for speed franchise, from NFSU2 on. THen i saw how many freaking dlcs and useless expasions they made, and i just got worse and worse.
ea ruined need for speed and tries to shove dlcs up our asses 24/7
( terrible support not included)
This probbaly goes agaisnt what most people are saying but i havent had much succes with him since the buff.
I played him 3 time(which is a sample too small to says if hes viable) and i had very little succes with him
I had a great ganks, decent clear time and insane buff control but it just wasnt enought.
In the 3 games, I probbaly had something like 60% of their wraith and we went in their jungle and stole almost every single buff but i still lost 2 of them.
One game went on to long and it reached the point where i did nothing(other than a sweet Baron steal) I did no damage, they had to many ways to interupt my ult(even with banshes) and my bloodboil wasnt enought to warrant a double support.  
The other game, 3 of us got caught by the tele+global combo they had and the game reverse-snowballed afer that attempt at golem
The problem is that nunu is still very high risk/low reward. You need succefully to invade to stay even with the other jungler and if you fail you can setyouserlf behind. counterjungling while behind is incredibly hard to do so you lose your main trick.
Nunu is a very team reliant jungler because even if you steal every buff your mid can still lose. You cannot directly impact in the game and you can only hope you lane will do well when you give them the advantage.
For that reason, i doupt he is viable in soloQ but i can see him behing a monster in competitive play
**Champion like shyvana, udyr, mundo and skarner still clear way to fast and there are very little room to steal their stuff** because they glide throught the jungle dispensing death. The only thing you can actually counterjungle is their buff and after stealing the first set they jsut grouped at the buff and denied our attempt
**Other champion like Nautilus, maokai, malphite, amumu generaly get most of their gold with the gp5 ad gank.** The counterjungling wont cripple them that badly and sthey still do very well with little items.
Even if they only have shurelia, Hog, boots and aegis/frozen heart at the 50min mark they still have more engadge power and you cc than you do. They will win in teamfight because their ability set is better than yours
**Against jungler that are farm depending(but not ultra fast)  nunu is a beast**. With the help of you mid you can do insane stuff and completely denie thier jungler.  i was a against a nocturne the game i won and he couldnt do anything
I feel like Nunu is very close to viability but i needs a small boost to his consume(so it has a use lategame). Maybe a debuff that amplify damage of soemthing...
*** i havent had much succes with him, he does not fair well against people that clear super fast or people that arent farm dependant. **All you can do is try you best to snowball the lanes** because you are useless lategame and an underfarmed jungleer on the other side probably still brings more to a teamfight than you
I am a live sound engineer and audio systems technician, and I routinely set up hi-fi sound reinforcement systems (funktion-one, void, danley sound labs, eaw, etc etc.) for various applications ranging from corporate meetings to live bands to electronic music 'raves', and these are my experiences:
1) for most home systems and headphones, most people wont notice the difference between a 192khz mp3 and a WAV.  Most of the compression happens to the bass frequencies and only becomes apparent when you have transducers dedicated to the reproduction of those frequency ranges.  All too often, a DJ will play a series of wav tracks, followed by a mediocre mp3, and its really a difference you can FEEL more than hear.  Its the difference between the bass just being there, and the bass being 'warm' and 'round'.
2) if you were born before 1985, chances are you like the sound of vinyl more than any digital source.  It all depends on what you grew up with, and what your brain is contitioned to appreciate.
With respect to dj's, lets get over the vinyl pure-ism.  IF you take excellent care of your records, IF you have played them less than 50 times, IF you always use your own quality needles (of the same shape), and IF you managed to get a good pressing to begin with, then maybe your vinyl records will sound comparable to the same track as a wav on a cd...
Then you have the problem that a needle is essentially a microphone, so unless you are playing your records from an accoustically isolated room, everything from the pounding bassline to the crowd screaming will be fed back thru the needle to the pa.
I understand that most of the comments in this thread are related to home/personal audiophile systems, but I am commenting from my perspective as an engineer for public events, where accoustical treatments are out of the question, and volumes routinely reach over 105db A (120 DB C).

  dj's, play wav's or gtfo.
IMO, the idea of a "perfect reproduction" is just one aspect of appreciating recorded music.  But people focus on it way too much, when it comes to A/B testing of different degrees of compression and what you could call the "just noticeable difference" between them.
What's interesting to me about A/B testing is that there is a range where listeners can tell that there is a difference between different degrees of compression, without being able to say which file was compressed more or less.  The fact that listeners can't indicate which is which is interpreted as meaning that they won't care one way or another.  
But that's not true.  For purely non-technical reasons, people care quite a lot.  E.g., in the world of painting, it's possible to create a reproduction of an art work that fools almost all people.  The majority wouldn't even be able to say that the two paintings placed side by side were different in any way.  But people who love art would obviously prefer to see the original than a reproduction -- just because it's the original painting.  The music recording, like the painting, is a cultural artifact.  Art and music lovers want to get as close to the cultural artifact as they can.  More complex in the case of music is the fact that we can view multiple objects as being the artifact -- in some cases, we view a live performance as the real, original cultural product, in others the song or composition, in yet others the musical group or orchestra's "characteristic" performance of a composition, and in others the recording itself.
Furthermore, people's auditory processing capabilities obviously are plastic.  If there is a range where we can notice a difference without verbally identifying which file is compressed more or less, then that is the area where learning takes place.  To train someone (or ourselves) to hear more meaningful details in the uncompressed recording, we could start with the A/B listening test and pick the version that comprises the "higher end" of the just noticeable difference, to listen to and train on.  Then after many repetitions, we would repeat the A/B test to find the next "just noticeable difference" that ought to develop from this process.  That would be one way of training auditory processing.
Finally, what you would most expect from many hours of intense music listening is the development of connections between the brain's auditory processing modules, emotion processing modules, and probably space/position processing modules.  The only reason to develop left-brain capacities in conjunction with music is musical training, audio engineering training, etc.  Being able to put a word on an amount of compression just from listening is a skill that probably has no purpose.  I.e., it wouldn't surprise me if you could practice the A/B listening test and get better and better at it.  But why would someone do that?
**** Authenticity is a purely normative value when it comes to art or music.

I've shared this before, so apologies if some have read it. Mom committed suicide in August 2003. In the days/ weeks/ months that followed, this happened:
As a temple recommend holder, I was asked to help dress her body in her temple clothes for the funeral. I tried to refuse and was guilt-tripped into it. I pretty much stopped trying to be temple worthy after that, because I never wanted to have to dress another deceased loved one for their grave.
My dad met a woman 3 or 4 months after mom died (in Nov/Dec 2003) through an lds dating site. They were engaged soon after, and married by May 1, 2004. I call her Connie 2 because she has the same name as my mom. During their dating/ engagement/ newlywed phase, dad and Connie often spoke of my mom. Apparently mom had a habit of dropping by to reassure Dad, Connie, my active siblings, and various ward members that she'd been close to that she was happy/ content in heaven, and that she was preparing mansions for them. Also she told dad and Connie that she blessed their marriage. 
**Meanwhile**, I, her daughter who had always struggled with religious doubts, was struggling with nightmares where my zombie mom reached to me with gravedirt fingers and begged me to explain why I'd let everyone forget her, why we had abandoned her in the cold earth, why a new Connie had moved into her house and bed. 
For me, it came down to two questions: **One** Why would mom comfort those who had testimonies, but not the doubting daughter who she loved just as much? *Answer*: God must be preventing her. That makes no sense. Why would God prevent that? If God was so cruel as to prevent that, why would mom put up with it? Mom always put her family first and loved all her children equally -- mom would burn down heaven itself if she had to in order to get to me and comfort me in my grief, and I know that in a way I have never known God. 
Which led to **question two**: Whose love do I trust more, God's or moms? *Answer* Well, I have a lifetime of evidence for my mom's love, and for God's love . . . just the assurance that he gives us nothing we cannot handle. Logically, that means moms suicide was in God's plan, because he had to know she could not in fact handle the depression. Suicide is like the antithesis of "handling" it. Unless God's mysterious plan means "handling it" is actually just removing herself from the situation . . . regardless, one way or another, God was either cool with mom's death, or mom was being punished for time and all eternity for a moment's weakness, and neither of those possibilities jived with the loving God I'd been taught about. 
There was also Connie 2 herself. She has serious issues with the whole heavenly polygamy thing. ***Serious*** issues. She's actually a pretty cool lady -- nothing like my mom, but cool in her own right. Unfortunately, she's *completely* thrown for a loop by my deceased mom who she never met. 
See, apparently dad's patriarchal blessing said something about knowing his eternal wife in the pre-existence and that he knew her name. Dad's always told that story in relation to Connie 1, my mom. But then he meets Connie 2, who has the same name and is also (now) an eternal wife. Suddenly what was once a sweet/ romantic story turns into a test for Connie 2 -- was she or my mom the intended wife from the pre-existence?
Connie 2 often ruminates on these things. She ricochets from faux respect for my mom to hoping my dad is righteous enough for two mansions so she doesn't have to share a household with a sister wife. She has actually told me that if my dad gets two mansions, then one will be like a place of learning/ university/ book club (that would be my college graduate mother) while the other would be like the playboy mansion (that would be Connie 2's perception of her worth). 
I'd always had doubts before 2003. I'd always been the black sheep of the family, always asking uncomfortable questions and doing things that seemed rational to me, but irrational to my family. When I was a teenager, my mom once caught me smoking pot. She went into this whole ranty guilt-trip thing with "where did I go wrong," and "what did I do wrong," regarding her parenting. I told her she'd done everything right, and I just couldn't help my personality -- I had to *know*, not just accept someone else's word/ experience. 
She kept bewailing the situation, and I grabbed her arm and said (paraphrasing, but this is the gist of it), "Mom. We were given free will. God doesn't want us to blindly obey orders; he wants us to build faith. I can't do that without experience -- how is it building faith if I'm just shutting my eyes and ears to the world around me and following the rules exactly? That's just leaning on your testimony, and you always tell me not to do that. I'm making my mistakes my way, and you just have to trust that God has a plan for me."
That was the kind of convoluted logic that always had my parents shutting up and sitting back, kind of shaking their heads and letting my blaze my own path, even if it lead away from the church. But I always meandered my way back. 
In the back of my mind, I always figured once I got married, had babies, was sealed in the temple -- once I did everything right, it would all just fall into place and stop being so damned hard. 
Instead, it got harder, and I hated being a mom and the temple ceremony was creepy and my doubts just got stronger and stronger. I kept praying and studying the scriptures and trying *so. damn. hard*. I kept trying to make it all fit. And then mom killed herself, and it was just like the need to try just disappeared. 
Then, on top of that, the wtf'ery of Connie 2's issues and jealousies -- especially when juxtaposed against her actually very nice, if a little too over-sharey personality -- it just highlighted the church crazy and how it can fuck with otherwise decent people's heads. 
Connie 2 has no reason to be jealous of my mom, or to try and devalue my mom's marriage to my dad (she's said at various times that dad stayed with my bipolar (in treatment) mom out of "duty", that dad didn't really have a sex life with my mom, that dad was "so relieved" that Connie 2 loves sex in a way Connie 1 never did (I know, the woman needs boundaries. Believe me, *I KNOW*. She has told me stories that scarred my poor brain. I kept yelling, *"I'm his daughter*, don't *tell* me that," but she kept talking.). 
She's told me ward members said my mom was "kind of a bitch" (the alleged ward member moved in after my mom fell into her final depression, and never actually knew my mom in health and joy), she tried to throw away my mom's wedding china, she did throw away my mom's funeral flower petals and wedding ring, and she refuses to use my mom's sewing machine or KitchenAid because "they're haunted." 
Yet despite all this insanity and insecurity, Connie 2 is a great woman. She's loves my dad completely and makes him happy, she's completely different in personality from my mom; more outspoken and adventurous. She's got a bit of a sailor mouth on her and is more relaxed about mormon conventions -- like, she says prayer by holding hands around the table instead of folding arms and bowing head. She's completely and 100% accepted the grandkids as "hers", and she's a fantastic grandmother. She has them come visit, makes great hand-made birthday and Christmas gifts, and has somehow managed to never once let her insecurities and jealousies regarding my mother slip to the kids. She's actually a really good person, it's just that since she can't actually be our stepmom (we were all grown and out of the house when mom died), she tries to be our friend . . . and with her personality, that results in some boundaries being crossed and conversations happening that just shouldn't. They just shouldn't.
Sorry, I got off tangent. Anyway, the point is *** After mom died, I stopped trying anymore. The drive behind staying had left. The absurdities and irrationality of it all was highlighted by my dad's remarriage. 
I do the same thing with all colored candy. 
I also don't step on any lines on the ground (or try not to), like cracks or spaces between tiles. I also don't let anything on tables touch each other. I don't let anything point directly at me. I like even numbers, so I do everything in even numbers. And if I touch something with one had, I have to touch it with the other. I don't know if these count as habits though. 
I'm a nut with multiple crazy habits/OCD's 
I dont know about a skype chat...but do we have an /r/comicbooks dedicated podcast? I know alot of podcasts are promoted on here but it would be pretty cool to have one that is dedicated soley to this subreddit (they would talk about alot of the content going up on the site and trends etc, maybe get some access for interviews with the AMA, and obviously talk weekly comics with cute namedrops of redditors who make good points in the threads)
Now the biggest problem is going to be "BUT THEN THEYLL START MAKING MONEY AND THATS WRONG!"....which I agree with. Maybe if an /r/comicbooks podcast does get big enough to ever turn (however small) profit they can use it to buy swag for giveaways and make the community bigger/more interested to come back. I'm going to go out on a limb and say most of the podcasts promoted here don't turn a profit so I dont see alot of this being a problem for them.


It would be cool if the the fine/talented people of r/comicsbooks would combine to form a super team and create a podcast we can all love and enjoy as a community
I hate my mother. She had a mental breakdown and ended up in and out of a mental institution. This happened right after I had my son. We were living with her and it was absolute hell. She would spend all day in bed. She would yell about anything. She would pick fights with me about everything. She told me I was "no longer her daughter" and that I was a "terrible mother" because I didn't follow her out-dated parenting advice. 
She then ended up moving to another country, leaving us (her two children and ex-husband) with her disgusting house in short sale and all her cluttered junk to sort through. She got married over there, ended up moving back to the US, and is now moving back to the UK to be with her husband. She is amazing self-serving and selfish. She is not the same person I grew up with. 
 I hate my mother, even though she used to be my absolute best friend up to three years ago when she had a mental breakdown shortly after I had my son.
I used to laugh at the idea of "men's rights" but after actually looking into the issues, and after my crazy ex spread all sorts of abuse stories about me after I apologized to her for speaking harshly after she left me for a friend, I've come to the conclusion that (at least in America) there is an almost Harrison Bergeron-like drive for forced "equality" that in reality just gives one group essentially special privileges against the group it was claimed held such privileges against them.

- Until such a time as people learn to get the hell over and stop obsessing about the differences we have, there will never be such a thing as equality, merely legal one-upmanship to the detriment of all.
I'm not downvoting you, but I think this is still pretty fucked up man. It then almost validates the racial policies/attitudes carried out. A twisted take on equality, "if it goes one way then it can go the other, cuz it's a two-way street". Read up on [white privilege] ( as it definitely gave me insight into my own persceptive (I'm ethnically french/english).

Original question by [Benteen_Bevalier](
&gt;Why do scabs itch so much if it is detrimental to pick at them?
Relevant comment courtesy [DoorsofPerceptron](
&gt;Evolution isn't perfect.
&gt;Basically what's going on here (in the most hand wavy terms imaginable) is that: skin regrowth (which is important) interferes with sensations of touch (which is also important).
&gt;This means that there aren't many simple modifications of the human body that would stop a scab from itching without breaking healing or touch. As both of these are more important than not picking at scabs, and it doesn't really harm you to pick at scabs, we're stuck in a local optima where stuff itches but you heal, and you can feel things.
Relevant [follow-up]( courtesy [omi_palone](
&gt;I think you can further reduce this explanation to take out some of the subjective analysis: the interstitial fluid that leaks out of damaged tissues is under enough hydrostatic pressure that (1) potential pathogens are constantly fighting against a current in order to get into the body and (2) this fluid motion carries a lot of other solutes out of the body in the process. We're not just talking about platelets and plasma proteins from blood, but also all sorts of enzymes, amino acids, collagen, etc. All that gunk is fairly heterogenous and, since it has no circulatory system, prone to rapid drying.
&gt;After that dry crust is set up, the inflammatory process associated with wound healing (I'm including phagocytosis and skin cell proliferation in this group together) really gets going. I think this is likely where the unbearable, deep itch is most implicated--the tremendous local rush of cytokines that keeps the body in both cleanup and rebuild mode gets so much activity going that innervated tissue is necessarily poked and prodded around by cell/tissue movement and chemical baths. I mean, [a lot of stuff is going on](  at the site of a wound for several weeks. The wikipedia article on [wound healing]( goes into more detail, although the itch response isn't taken into account specifically.
&gt; scabs, or the tissue regenerating into and beneath them, have a lot going on and probably every aspect of the process is itchy.
I was looking for a pretty old reddit comment/picture where some guy says 'So there i was, fucking my sister, ........' can't remember exactly, but it's friggin weird. Then some guy responded 'wat', and the guy repeats it all but in bold text. The other guy says 'got it, thanks' or something like that. It cracked me up when i saw it some time ago on reddit. So I was searching for it on google and it came up with a lot of fucked up stuff like this.... There were some more fucked up comments on this website too.
 Sorry to disappoint, do not feel the need to fuck my sister.
I agree, this happened to me with the new movie Ted, I saw one preview and knew I had to see it and then I saw that same preview along with 3 or 4 other previews over and over plus I didn't see it till a week after and all my friends told me stuff about it, I pretty much knew all the lines once I saw the movie. Very disappointed.
 Same thing just happened with Ted
They're almost giving away the plot. I understand marketing a film, but it's getting a bit beyond what they need to be doing now. They know the market, and they're going over board on it. The problem is i want to see the film so bad that I'll still watch everything that gets posted. All the trailers/TV spots/featurettes and in my head I have a pretty good idea of what I think is going to happen in the film already. But since it's only just over a week out, I'm trying to stay clear of everything now. 
 Too much unneeded advertising. They know the market. I still watch everything they throw out tho, cant help it. Cant wait!
I wish there was a band of magic leprechauns who would gather up every piece of litter people had left behind during the previous year. On the last day of December those magic leprechauns would sneak into houses before dawn and create a pile of that litter. A tower of garbage that would tumble the onto the bed the second the guilty party reaches for the snooze button. Oh and all the nice people who didn't litter at all during past year would be left with a pot of gold.

I drive an F-250, but then again, I do haul things and move stuff/people around.  Aside from a couple of problems that came from the factory, the Enterprise has been reliable and solid.  Lots of leg and head room, and in a pinch, the back seat can be used as a fairly comfortable sleeping area (crew cab).  
I was in Texas recently for a wedding.  The rental company thinks that a Volkswagen Passat is a full sized car.  While the rental company may think this, it isn't.  While the headroom was good, the "cockpit" where the driver has to be is a bit cramped, and the foot pedals are very close together.  It drove well, but getting in and out was a hassle, and the fact that I was constantly battling against my right leg for control of the steering wheel made the Passat experience a real downer.
 I normally drive an F-250, it's tall and big friendly.  Texas lies about everything being bigger there.
Academic integrity is a control behavior designed to act as a counterbalance for an uncontrollable behavior.  Simple exploration of the feelings behind this unbending loyalty to the sacredity of a system meant to exclude the "unworthy" will uncover few nourishing results.
I'm not meaning to criticize your thinking on this, because it's natural to want to hobble or hamper someone who competes with you.  What I am saying is look truly at the situation, negating any feeling of obligation you have to any system you claim allegiance to, and judge your potential actions directly in relation to your personal tangible gain.
- Obligation to imaginary things can misguide even the smartest of us.
Never hurt when you can.  Hurt when you must.
I know that feel. I used to work in medical records at a local hospital when I was in high school. The job was dull and repetitive. I had almost nothing in common with my coworkers, and most of them would slack off, while still trying to maintain the illusion of being productive. My goal ended up being to be better at their jobs than they were. It was a lofty goal, since I was there only on weekends and during vacations, and they all had been around longer than me, working 40 hours per week. It hit the point where I worked for 12 hours one day, but really I only worked for 6, or so. I just hung out and chilled with my bosses for the other 6 hours. Why didn't I get into trouble? I decimated all of our backlog and did about 3 days worth of work in one day. My boss didn't care how much I was paid, just as long as we were caught up.

This girl I had been talking to who goes to my university, got pulled over earlier that night and was upset about it. She called me and asked if I could come over and be supportive. I was walking to her place from the parking lot and noticed another guy walking in the same direction as me. He was a big dude. (I'm 6'2" and he had 3-4 inches on me) we didnt even make eye contact and he went up the stairs on one side of the building and I went up the other. We see eachother again as we both approach said girl's room. He was the Ex-boyfriend and she had called him to come over also. I had no idea who he was and I didn't know he would be there. She came out and tried to introduce us, he made a smartass comment and obviously had a problem with me being there. She told him to calm down but he got more and more worked up and then yelled right at my face, "I'm going to break your neck". Never in all my life did I believe someone's threat of violence like I did his. Maybe it was because he looked huge and insane all at once. It was 1 year ago and we didn't really talk anymore after that. 
 Awesome girl's ex-bf threatened my life and I truly believed him.

So that's what ginger beer is, eh?
One of the most famous common law court cases is an old UK decision called *Donoghue v Stevenson*. Old Mrs. Donoghue bought herself a refreshing ginger beer, only to find a dead snail in it (after drinking half the bottle). Naturally, she threw a bit of a shit fit and apparently got gastroenteritis for awhile.
At that time, she would have had to rely on the law of contract to get any redress. However, she only had a contract with the shopkeeper (not the manufacturer), and the shopkeeper hadn't really done anything wrong. 
So Mrs. Donoghue decided to sue the manufacturer (Mr. Stevenson) anyway. Turns out, she wins the whole case. The court decides that if it's reasonably foreseeable that your actions can harm another person, then you have a 'duty of care' to avoid causing that harm (they used the analogy of a good neighbour).
The judgment was limited to product liability scenarios, but actually gave rise to the entire legal concept of 'negligence', which has been at the heart of thousands and thousands of civil suits (and is now enshrined in statute in some areas). You learn about it on day one of your Torts class in first year law school, or at least I did.
Anyway, I always wondered what the hell ginger beer was. I'll have to give one if these a try.

Actually it is probably is possible. Have you heard of [Gilroy Gardens]( I am pretty sure the guy that runs this park has some special way of growing trees to make odd shapes. My guess is it has something to do with light (not gravity). Plants always grow towards the light so they could have had the tree in this picture rotating as it was growing to make this shape. 
- I have no idea if this particular image is fake or not but I believe it is theoretically possible.
Ok. I am a guy who has been raped. I generally try to avoid this issue, but I'm getting more and more irritated every time I see people bring it up who have never actually gone through anything like that, trying to take a moral high ground. It may not be their fault, they don't have perspective, and even among people who have gone through shit like this there is disagreement.
Rape is something that happens. It's a horrible experience. The proper response is NOT to pretend it doesn't exist, or try to suppress discussion or representation of it in any sort of media. The main argument that I see is that video game writing isn't good enough to bring up the topic in a "proper" way, which is generally not wrong. However, this is not a good reason to be morally outraged. If somebody thinks the writing is bad, that is their *opinion*, and writers should not have to avoid a subject completely lest their writing be judged *bad*, and, by extension, because they brought up a thorny issue, they are then considered *terrible people*. If you think a rape scene is badly handled, by all means, say so. Say that you don't think the writer is very good and handled the issue like shit. However, please don't go all moral crusader on everybody, bleating on about what *horrible people* the content creators are when, at worst, their crime is that they lacked perspective.
The most insulting thing about this entire discussion, and what triggered this rant, is when people suggest that being raped completely shatters a person's psyche and they can't even be reminded of the event lest they are driven mad by depression, or PTSD, or whatever the hell people think happens. Personally, while it was hard for me to deal with what happened for a few years after it happened, I wasn't broken. This may be shocking, but *gasp* I could still consume media that dealt with the subject! I watched American History X, and didn't curl up into a ball crying! I am totally fine if the media I am consuming reminds me of what happened because *it is just media*. It is uncomfortable at worst, which is totally OK because a depiction of rape should *not* be comfortable. Even a badly executed/written scene involving rape will just make me groan, just as any other badly done scene would.
If something *condones* rape - that is fucking horrible, and yes, it pisses me the hell off. If I hear a joke trivializing rape, I get upset. That's really about it. That is the line where it is unacceptable. And, contrary to popular belief, most media today *does not cross that line*. Even when a tasteless show like Family Guy jokes about rape, the joke is the utter shock of this *completely horrible* shit happening, not, "Haha, that guy got raped, what a pussy."
So that's my two cents as somebody who has actually gone through this. And one more thing, just to settle an incredibly stupid argument I often see in threads like this, murder is worse than rape. Hands down. I would rather be raped than murdered.
Let people make media involving rape. If they condone it, or completely trivialize it, then *don't support that artist*, and by all means, talk about how horrible they are. But please, don't be so quick to jump down peoples' throats; if there is some bad writing, call it bad writing, but don't call the writer a bad person.
Ok, listen up cause we need to have a little chat. I feel like you missed a great opportunity for a pun here. Now, I know what you're thinking, "What the fuck is this less than solid shithead saying?" and "A pun? Who the fuck needs puns?". Well guess what? This guy needs 'em. They're little gems of mundane gold that for some lizard brained reason just hit on a basic primitive level of humor. So next time say heights instead of length please?
It's amazing what heights people will go to capture the perfect picture
I ran into a very similar situation last month: met a girl two weeks before she was moving to another state for a job.  My mindset was: "this is a cool, cute girl.  I want to have sex with her, but I'm happy just being friends with her."  That mindset took the pressure off of me, and as we hung out over the first week, I think my lack of sexual escalation with her made her feel very comfortable around me.  
During the first week I kept inviting her out to do fun things with me and my friends.  After doing this about 3-4 times (inviting her to a workout, a couple dinner/drink get togethers, and a concert) and hanging out every other day, I thought I was in the friend zone and was pretty fine with that (with the exception of when I briefly kissed her at the end of the night on dates #2 and 3).  Well, she ended up texting me that she wanted to do something chill with just me.  So we went out again the next day, just to two of us and things escalated quickly.  Turns out she has only slept with a couple guys, all of which were longer-term bfs.  She felt I was really fun and interesting, so decided she got to have sex with someone new before her vacation ended and job started.  Now I have a new, very attractive and fun friend in another state I am sure I will get to spend a weekend with here and there in the future.
I think if I had been aggressive from the start it would have been a big turnoff for her.  Granted, every girl is different, so read the situation. It all comes down to being fun, interesting, and forming a connection with someone.  That is the basis of PUA, in my opinion.  And for me, I've learned to keep a mindset where I don't mind being 'friend-zoned.'  It is great to have attractive female friends around you can hang out with when you don't have a date.  It is good social validation, plus I have ended up sleeping with a couple girls I'm friends with after knowing them for a few months or years.  
  Don't be so outcome dependent.  Be fun, interesting, and try to form a connection.  Make friends, get laid.
Just two ~~quick~~ things.
&gt;I honestly believe that viewing people as individuals rather than as groups is a fundamental part of not being a terrible person.

I completely agree, it's just too bad she pretty much just called herself a terrible person.

&gt;No more men would automatically mean no more patriarchy

Now this is probably the biggest reason I absolutely detest the word patriarchy. Some feminists actually, truly believe that "the patriarchy" is made up entirely of men. "The patriarchy" is however just an idea and it just happens to be a feminist spin on an already common idea. Common synonyms for "the patriarchy" are "the ruling class", "the rich and powerful", "the 1%", "the illuminati" etc. It is the idea of a group of people that control society and oppress those below them because of the power they and their group have.
The idea of this ruling class of illuminati controlling civilization in order to reach their evil goals of world domination is pretty insane in itself. Yes, there are some pretty powerful people that are terrible people, but it's not the global oppression conspiracy that those people in the tin-foil hat store like to talk about. "The patriarchy" is just a twist on that idea, a feminist twist where they claim that it is some secret club made up of entirely men, and all men regardless of social status get the newsletter every month. It is entirely too obvious that the only purpose of this idea is to vilify men as some sort of insane rallying call to women to view all men automatically as the enemy.
On top of that, there seems to be the idea that only we can *defeat* this "patriarchy" that the world will be a happy and peaceful place where criminals don't exist and no one is discriminated again. That is a bunch of fairytale garbage. It is human nature to have that upper class of people (whether they are evil megalomaniacs or not) is taken down or otherwise disappears, another group will take it's place. If this "patriarchy" was a real thing and men suddenly disappeared, you know what would happen? A bunch of power hungry women would take their place.
 Patriarchy = feminist version of illuminati conspiracy
I think it'll be good, but I wonder if the other infrastructure will be able to cope, like the national grid. The amount of transmissions lines that would need to be put up and then the substations etc may be a problem and then there will be the people who will complain it ruins the view from their kitchen windows. Then there's the rail infrastructure it self with the installation of electrification, it'll mean that the loading gauge wouldn't be right. When the Victorians built the line I doubt they thought about electric trains travelling on the rails, so bridges and tunnels would have to be adapted/raised/complete new builds or the the track would need to lowered. Improving signalling to ERTMS would need to be considered. Or they could just re open the Woodhead route, It would cut the times between Manchester and Sheffield Down.
- Has government thought about the electrical power needed for so many electric trains. Massive engineering work to accommodate the overhead wires on Victorian lines, have they thought about this cost as well.  
If I've missed someone saying this in the thread, forgive me. Colonial America was divided between the north and the south: in the north, there were mostly people who wanted to get away from the social structures they'd left behind in Europe, while in the south, there were mostly people who wanted to carry those structures over, only with themselves on top. (Yes, this is a huge oversimplification. Forget it, I'm on a roll.) Slavery existed in the north, mostly for household servants and industrial labor, but it made much more sense in the south, where it provided cheap agricultural labor. The north profited from slavery immensely, by insuring slave traders and buying the raw materials the south produced, among other things. But one way of understanding the Civil War is that the north began to get the idea that a slave-holding south wasn't in its financial interests. The war was fought in large part to prevent the expansion of slavery westward, which would have upset the fragile economic and political balance of the antebellum period. 
As well, the north industrialized much earlier than the south, leading to two fundamentally different economic orders. In the north, there were free farmers, financial services, and industry. In the south, it was almost all agriculture all the time: mostly small free farms with fewer, large-scale plantations staffed by slaves thrown in.
So far, just basic history. The result of the initial conditions I've sketched out is that the northern part of the US developed as a relatively homogeneous, industrialized society. Yes, they had trouble absorbing immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe, but as most people know, the northern part of the US is basically white. As a result, it developed on a similar track to western Europe, what most of us would recognize as liberal democracy.
The south, on the other hand, was both rural *and* divided racially. That meant it developed much more unequally, closer to what you would see in Latin America. Sociologically, the South resembles Colombia or Brazil in a lot of ways.
Anyway, what about California and the rest of the West Coast? Well, they developed relatively late, and many of the people who migrated to the large coastal cities did so because they wanted to escape the racial and economic divides in their home states. The people who settled inland were often poor farmers (read: Okies) who brought their existing prejudices with them.
Again, all oversimplified, and it leaves out some parts, such as why Los Angeles or San Francisco grew up into tolerant, multi-cultural cities, or the effect religion has on all of it, but there you have it.
**** Whities in the north and west didn't have to keep brown people down, but the crackers in the south did.
I sort of am. I wouldn't want to do anything more involved than sort of making a exaggerated dialect of english, though; something like using reddit cliches as idioms to a farther extent than they're currently used. Something like the following.
This is Sagan. = I approve of this.
He got rolled.(as in rickroll) = He was tricked.
He redd. = He read.
I only eat bacon. = I only eat food.
I'm surrounded by little narwhals. = I'm surrounded by little animals.
I up-vote you. = I love you.
= Shut up.
That kind of thing. Again, the above isn't a concrete proposition, just an example.
you may be highly tolerant to it. I have the exact same thing with shrooms. i've taken an 8th on 3 occasions with multiple friends each time. we all had the exact same bag and split it up, and they all tripped, so I know that it was not due to any external factors. it felt like i took a small hit of marijuana it affected me so weakly. i do not know the biological basis for my "immunity" but you may be in a similar boat
you very well may be "immune".
When I was little, I was kind of a nightmare child and I always misbehaved. One day, I was at home with my mom while my dad was at work, and I was being exceptionally terrible. My mom was kind of going crazy, and decided to call my dad to ask him what to do. At that age (3 or 4 I believe) I was obsessed with Sesame Street and Elmo was my absolute favorite character, and my dad used this to devise a plan. My parents got off the phone, and my dad waited a minute and called back. When my mom answered it, she looked at me and said "OH MY GOSH! ELMO is on the phone and wants to talk to you!!!" I panicked, took the phone, and listened to what Elmo had to say. On the other end was my dad talking in an Elmo voice, saying things like "you need to be a good girl and listen to what your mommy says, okay?" and "promise to be good and listen to your mommy!" I promised Elmo that I would never be bad again. This phone call made my entire life. I went around bragging to everyone in my family that Elmo called me, and I'm pretty sure I believed it until I was like 7 or 8, when my Grandma started teasing me for the whole thing - I'm 20 and she still laughs her ass off when it gets brought up.
*** My dad pretended to be Elmo on the phone and for a while after that I truly believed that Elmo had called me.
You aren't invincible with it- All I need to do is make sure I have more DPS than you have boosting power, which isn't hard with the way PvP is these days. 980 Shields boosted every 4 seconds from your booster. 500 Damage Per Second from a Battlecruiser is pretty easily attainable. 2000 Damage every 4 seconds and you only boost 980? That's 920 damage marked against you. And now your booster is cycling for another 4 seconds before the next rep, which means 500 Damage per second for another 4 seconds, and your boost will still only rep 980. You're in the hole no matter what you're boosting power is and the Ancillary booster's 60 second reload time really really hurts your already failing tank. And I still can't justify having a longer reload cycle than Actual boosting cycle. 
 You aren't invincible for those 52 seconds, at best you're a little more resilient. 
Some personal info first: I live in Detroit, arguably the most downtrodden major city in the USA. Thirty percent of the city lives at or below the the poverty line. Remember, this line is defined as 20,000 US dollars per year for a family of four. This means that there are countless others who are poor and not living beneath this line. Suffice to say, I think I have a rather intimate understanding of issues of poverty, at least in my city.
Now, the questions.
&gt;Is it OK to give a few dollars once a week and feel absolved from ones Christian duty?
Absolutely not. We are told to take up our crosses and follow Christ. This is a lifelong, all day, everyday commitment. If we do not follow the teaching's of Christ with our whole being, we are being false Christians. The idea that I can give to charity once a week and then go and spit on the homeless with the other six days is ridiculous and anti-Christian. We are called to follow Christ at all times, in all things. 
&gt;Is it enough to feel that these people have made poor choices and thus, "get what they deserve?"
No. In America, these issues are systemic. That's demonstrably true. There exist power institutions which prevent the poor from overcoming their poverty. While some misfortune may result from personal choice, I don't think it's fair to say that all the poor are at fault. When the prevailing system tells the upper classes that the American dream is alive, but tells the poorer classes that they're lazy scum, we're bound to have some problems. 
&gt;Shouldn't a truly Christian COMMUNITY be doing more?
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. But most people are CINO's - Christians in name only. It's typically true of the politically right-wing Christians, but  liberal Christians are guilty of this too.
&gt;Is it just a matter of not caring about people and choosing to focus on other initiatives instead? The ol' "You can't help everyone" idea?
As namer said, you can't help everybody. But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Just because I'm focused on ending institutionalized poverty in the city of Detroit, doesn't mean I don't care about the institutionalized racism of non-white, non-black minorities in the city (In Detroit, 80 percent of the city is of African descent, making them the majority). I care about he plight of the Bengali people living in the inner city, but I'm currently working on poverty.
&gt; How does one bridge the disconnect between the reality of what one would see, smell and hear every single day - people are literally starving in the streets - with a WWJD mandate from the pulpit?
Laziness and a lack of priories. People don't want to get their hands 'dirty'. They'd much rather write a check then come down from the suburbs and help the impoverished - that's a Detroit thing; the wealth disparity due to the white flight of the 1960's and 70's is insane. As well, people often prioritize the perceived 'social values' of Christianity over truly helping the impoverished. This can range from hating gays to wanting prayer in school. Whatever it is, it's not what Christ said to do. 

Perhaps the biggest problem with modern American Christians - at least from what I've seen - is that they tend to combine the Protestant work ethic with some sort of karmic philosophy (never thought I'd write that sentence). That is, they seem to think that hard work = success and therefore everyone who is poor is lazy and doesn't want it. This view is what I call the greatest American heresy, and is one of the largest problems plaguing Christianity. People don't follow Christ's teachings in the context that he taught them - they absorb non-religious, non-factual, classist nonsense into them and call it Christianity. 
Which it's not.
** Screw you, read it. People in the west are lazy and need to further understand things and not just opt for the easy way out**
It's related to everything in fact... Even to a tuna sandwich... So... Stop being a dick and help, build that FTL-drive already...
*My wife and I breed goldendoodles*
Please stop.  You're part of the problem.  Anyone who breeds designer dogs isn't a real breeder.  If your wife is studying to be a vet I'm sure her courses have covered the massive pet overpopulation issue.  One litter of unnecessary mutts kills a litter in a shelter.  If you know that and still continue to breed designer dogs you are willingly contributing to a problem.
** That's bad and you should feel bad**
I was kind of the opposite. I don't like girls in porn, but I still find some women (like Christina Hendricks) hot. For a few months now my bf and I have been intimate with one of my close girl friends, and it's amazing. I definitely wouldn't want that with just anyone, but I never would have imagined I could be as happy as I am now. It hasn't changed how I feel about other women in general, it's just strange that she makes me know I'm bi when I might otherwise say "I'm straight vag=eew". Btw; I think it's part of the infatuation, but her privates taste like candied rose petals and her smell is absolutely intoxicating. I still enjoy my boyfriend, but we have fun when she is with us too.
 Maybe you just haven't found the right gal ;) 
I used to think I was straight, and the funny thing is in highschool I knew I was attracted to women, but I sort of thought everyone was the same way. I had to cognitively learn what makes a guy attractive, based on how other people reacted to certain things.... I remember once I was talking about how hot a guy was and my friend was like "umm... he looks like a jock" which apparently is bad. I thought that it was more of a thing that people learned rather than something that people felt. I ended up dating a lot of older men, and unattractive boys, because I was genuinely attracted to their personality and how they treated me (which was not necessarily good).
I don't have to convince myself that women are attractive the same way I had to with men, and I definitely can tell, innately, if a woman is sexy or not. I don't have to examine it, it comes naturally.
As for the porn thing, it's not really my thing, I like pictures of naked people and all, but porn isn't something that I masturbate to. I know a lot of gay women who are into porn with men in it, and I've heard some gay women only watch male/male stuff. I think that genders in porn are portrayed in a certain way, and the way porn directors produce a certain dynamic is often by choosing the gender of the performer. So if you're into girl/girl, you might be into the tenderness aspect, whereas if you're into guy/guy, you're maybe into a different aspect (this is just an educated guess). I've also heard that some people like girl/girl or guy/guy because they want to see, men for example, but they don't want to see them with another woman.
** you might be gay, but don't let your sexual fantasies dictate your romantic orientation.**
I'm with you. This could spell the end of the world and all we're bothered about is the threat of being stung.

So, living in the dorms these past few years has been interesting. It was a high school, though, so the administration was SUPER big on no PDA. At all. But hey- we were all teenagers. Who cared? I had fooled around plenty in the school itself. Old classrooms would be used for movie nights and you'd throw something on the projector, blankets on the floor and just go for it.
But, I was like, fuck no-- I'm going to be classy. I'm going to have to inisit we use a bedroom. So whoooo! Big deal, I was going to sneak onto his hall. Actually, not a big deal whatsoever. I was always the risk taker, so I didn;t think twice about it. He, on the other hand, wasn't. He was always paranoid and such, with good reason. 
So one day his roommate and I conspire to open the door to his room, and his hall and let me in. It's early in the morning- about 6 or 7. And his roommate snuck me in. I get into my boyfriend's bed, his roommate goes back to bed maybe five feet from us. We start fooling around, and I look over to see if his roommate is asleep or not. The genius had put drapes over his bed to make it an impenetrable cave. So we started to do it... For the first time, ever. And I look over and the kid is just looking at me. Mouth wide open. Giving me a thumbs up. I laughed a little bit, and just kept going. The roommate went back to bed. 
 Gave a show for my first time because I insisted on a bed rather than a classroom floor. 
Wow, and here I was thinking just women were like that. Thank you for making clear how false that was. 
Here's what I make of it. You are just as bad as her. She's in the exact position you are, trying to figure out if you actually like her or not. 
You think she's hot? I think people are hot, that doesn't mean I think they're dating material. Minus 1 point. 
You ask her to hook you up with her friends? Well, then she will definitely be confused as to whether you like her or not. She'll be thinking that clearly she isn't the centre of your attention if you're thinking about her friends/other girls in general. 
You two text? You two want to hang out? I do that with plenty of people. From your explanation, your conversation was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary/suggestive of greater interest. 
From this, I can't tell what she wants. But if you hadn't said you actually liked her, I wouldn't have been able to tell you like her either. If she's now single, just ask her if she'd be interested in going on a date. If she's a decent human being, she'll either say yes or clearly tell you she only wants to be friends.
**The only way you'll find out is if you ask.** 
I agree this situation is very serious.
Did you even ask Sparkles if this is okay? You're assuming he's okay with all of the plounge knowing his real life troubles (including his post on MLSG) without his permission....?
Also I'm not really sure a post like this belongs on the plounge unless it's something like "A fellow plounger needs a place to stay for the night, anyone here who can help from Iowah?"
On top of all that, now there's a bunch of drama down here in the comments where there doesn't need to be any.
 I feel this whole thing was poorly handled by all those involved.
I hope Punk loses the belt to Cena. In all honesty I really do. I really think the WWE needs to restructure their Championship ladder.
Give the WWE Championship to Cena, have him be the next Hogan and have him hold it for however long he wants. That way I know 3 things:
1. The WWE Title will be the main event.
2. Cena will keep the Title.
3. I don't have to watch those matches.
Let Punk/Bryan/Kane/Jericho/Del Rio/Sheamus/Ziggler/Miz fight over the WHC. That way:
1. Great Matches can be had by all.
2. The WHC can actually change hands in meaningful and impressive fueds.
IC will stay strong with its own breed of talent, TV title can be used to push up and comers and returning talent and the Tag division can mean something whenever we get actual tag teams on the belt.
** Give the Belt to Cena, Restructure all other Championships.**
I made a post on Craigslist trying to sell or trade my IPad 1 16 GB (basically the first model). In the post I said, either looking for straight up cash, or old Nintendo games ranging from NES to N64. I got an E-mail from a guy claiming that he had Earthbound and a few other games. Not sure where I was just being trolled or not, I responded saying I was interested and would like to see pictures. He sent a picture of the cartridge which was a little torn up in the left corner, and said that since not all the games are in good condition he would add some cash to sweeten the deal. I accepted since it seemed fair seeing how the IPad was worth like on the ups of 175, and I no longer use it since I just recently bought a laptop. So he shows up, big guy, tattoos everywhere including his face, hands me a little bag with all these games in it and graciously includes a 50 dollar bill aswell. I was pretty excited, I ran upstairs and tested it out and it was in great working condition. So /r/gamecollecting, that is my story. 

: I traded an Ipad I never used for Earthbound, a few other solid titles and $50.
Haha, I had the same feeling. Like I told my parents and they weren't happy but understood... Luckily both of them used to/have smoked before but not since I've been on the earth. It also helps that my older brother, a heavy smoker, is getting paid by Johns Hopkins to get his Masters along with the fact that I'm graduating in a year.. As long as I get my shit done, they don't give me shit. 
*** Parent's don't smoke, but as long as I get my shit done, they don't give me crap.
rEFIt is most frequently used to get Linux running on a Mac, since the default boot loader won't recognize it as an OS option.
Normally when you turn a Mac on, the EFI (think of it like a BIOS and bootloader rolled into one) checks the hardware to make sure everything's okay, finds the OS, then hands control of the computer over to the OS, which then starts loading OS files and user data into memory. rEFIt sits between EFI and the OS waving its hands frantically going, "Hi! I'm an OS! Boot me!" so the EFI will hand control over to it. Once it has control, it can then hand that off to all the standard OSes, plus the ones that the default Mac EFI doesn't support like Linux and perhaps USB/Tbolt Windows installs.
The bootloader can only load a few OSes. With rEFIt, the bootloader loads a different bootloader that can load a lot more OSes.
That was insanely kind of you, but the TLDR makes you sound like an asshole.
I completely agree with first comment. &gt;:( and btw best tldr i've ever seen. Upvote for u sir
I had something similar happen the last time I spent a day at the amusement park with Patrick!
The only difference was that I got pretty hungry waiting for the bus.  There was a vending machine across the street from the bus stop, and every time I went over there to get food the bus would show up and drive off before I could get back across the street.  The worst part was, I had put money in the vending machine and decided to leave it to try and catch the bus.  While I was failing to catch the bus, one of the locals walked up the the vending machine and managed to buy some candy on my dime!
At least the guy who brought me the balloon was nice.
- Don't go to Rock Bottom.  It's weird there.
Okay, so I'll tell one on myself. 
About 11 years ago, I worked as a waitress at Denny's for like 2 months. I wasn't that great. I was cute, I smiled, but I am severely ADD. Just as an example of this whole experience-my first table that I had all by myself was 3 uniformed cops &amp; I was stoned.
Anyways, getting to the point. I had a large table with about 10 people, ranging from infants to grandparents. And they were horrible to me. I think I forgot one drink, and corrected it as soon as it was brought to my attention, but from that point on, they played "let's make the white girl cry" (and lost). They went out of their way to be horrible people, from sending things back, requesting stuff they didn't need, etc. And the whole time, I'm just smiling and running back &amp; forth. So of course, they left no tip. 
However, the bitchiest one at the table left a pen behind. I kept it, and it was the best pen ever, until it died. They didn't give me a tip, but they gave me an awesome pen.
 lousy people gave me the greatest pen ever.
I hate how other races think it's okay to be racist against white people whereas if a white did the same thing there would be a whole big stink about it and that person would be labeled as a racist for the rest of their existence at that job (assuming the other employees aren't racist...) But if it's some other ethnicity it's perfectly fine to be rude to white people and make hateful comments based only on the color of their skin. 
 Treat others the way you want to be treated
My family and I went to Boston last September to help me move some stuff in for college. We had booked two rooms for the hotel we were staying at. 
We get there, got our keys and made our way up to our room. Turns out, we got one room... with one bed, for four people. So we tried again. My mom and I went back down to the front desk, waited in line patiently, and explained to them that we booked two rooms (pretty much next to each other I think). The staff member helping us was very nice, apologized and gave us what we thought were keys to our two new rooms. We failed to realize that they gave us keys to a room with two beds. Not two rooms. Try again.
We head back down to the front desk one more time, hopefully the last time, and wait in line again. At this point we're frustrated but the hotel seemed pretty busy at the time we were there so we were patient with them. We get to the front again and this time we actually get to speak to a manager. We explain to him everything that has happened. He was nice and apologized to us, then gave us the two rooms we were supposed to get. He mentioned that they probably won't be next to each other but the rooms would be close.  We said great and after he gave us some coupons for a free continental breakfast (which I learned doesn't include any of the hot food they had at their breakfast buffet) as an apology, we went on our way to our rooms, so it turned out alright in the end... or so we thought. 
We get up to one room and we look at the other key-card holder for the other room. We thought the rooms would be close, we knew they wouldn't be next to each other but at least within a few doors. Not really. Turns out, the other room was on the complete opposite side of the floor and pretty much in the opposite corner from ours. At least it was on the same floor as our other room. We didn't even want to bother complaining about that since the front desk was probably sick of us by then and we were tired of the whole thing too. It wasn't too terrible, at least we were on the same floor, so we settled for what we had. Safe to say we won't be stay at that hotel in the future.
 Hotel gave us rooms we didn't book twice, even after getting the two rooms we originally booked they weren't anywhere near each other. At least they were on the same floor.
Local Pharmacy/Convenience store chain. Rather large place. I usually buy candy there if I'm not dieting. My gf and I were coming up to my parents house from hers, 2 hours away. I think we wanted to grab some drinks or something, I don't remember. 
She goes over to the cosmetics, because fuck it, and sees that they are having a significant sale on things; Like 50% off and other %'s. I am peeking at the deodorant section, which has half an entire aisle marked Buy 1 Get 1 50% off(of equal or lesser value, etc.). I'm usually skeptical about this place already because of how lax they are with putting up and taking down sale signs, so I check the dates to make sure we're good. So, we're pumped. She gets some nail tools, I grab a stick and a spray, she grabs a stick and a spray. We go to checkout. 
She purchases everything, as it's not much with all the sales we got, right? I check the receipt just before we hit the door. It's about $40, and bells start going off in my head. There's no way this stuff comes up to $40 on sale. I go through checking the discounts, or lack thereof. The bogo50% didn't even show up, and several nail items weren't correctly priced either, it should have been a little under $25. 
I about face, walk over to the register we were at, and explain it to the cashier, who calls up the shift manager, a little indian woman, late-40's. I explain the situation to her, and we have to walk her around and show her the damn signs for everything. At this point, I'm pretty pissed already because it's pure goddamned laziness that caused this. 
She okays the nail items and goes over to the deodorant. She looks at the sign and says "equal or lesser value". I point out what we both chose, and how they comply to that stipulation. She says, "No, must be same brand." Brand does not in any way equate to value unless you are considering the value to be the textual description of the item. I try to explain this to her. She just repeats what she said. 
By now, gf is in "whatever" mode (she's normally very patient), and grabs 2 Dove products while I grab 2 Old Spice products, and we go through everything at the register to make sure we only get what we want. The woman now has to create a refund, and she continues mumbling on about things. At this point, gf is saying things like "This is ridiculous", "We are never coming here again", "You shouldn't have those signs up. They are blatant lies.", and such. (I actually haven't been back since. Trying to avoid candy, and I work at Target, which has better prices for almost anything anyway, plus my discount)
Everything is said and done, and, iirc, we actually end up leaving having spent $2-$3 more after the whole ordeal. We were just fuming, and needed to get home. She just wants to relax, but I'm super money conscious, and am pissed about the whole ordeal for a while before she calms me down, even though she was the one who paid for everything. 
- Rite Aid products and sales are good. Employees? Not so much. So glad I didn't end up working there in my teens like I wanted to.
I was taking care of my mom's animals while she was away on vacation. I came by her house late in the evening. I noticed that one of the parrot fish had gone belly up. This was a pretty large fish tank, so the fish had gotten to be the size of a fist. I scooped it out, and tried to flush it down the toilet. Didn't work--- it was just a smidgen too big.
Tried to get it back out with the net, but the fish was lodged perfectly in the bottom so I couldn't quite get it out. So I reluctantly grabbed some latex gloves and pulled it out.
Good son that I am, I opted to take the dead fish dripping with toilet water outside to the garbage bin...
And left my keys inside.
I hadn't forgotten my cell phone, so I called a locksmith. I needed to get some sleep, so I asked that they send someone early enough in the morning so I could still get to work/school/dentist appointment or whatever I had the next day, so 6am.
Thankfully I had left the garage door open (it's a separate building FYI) so I found a sleeping bag and tried to get some sleep.
6am rolls around. I start getting nervous at about 6:15. I called the dispatcher for the locksmith, and she sounded earnest enough that I believed her when she said she'd get right on it.
It was a bit uncomfortable of a spot to be waiting for someone and simultaneously needing to get ready to go somewhere. And I'm sure they'd jet if I was a no-show.
Two hours later, and still no sign of the guy. I asked the dispatcher to have him at least call me. Still, 30 minutes after that conversation, nothing.
I called a different locksmith, and explained the situation. They said they wouldn't send someone to a location where another locksmith was already called in to. I probably could have just called back with a deeper voice and lied, but luckily my mom emailed me telling me where a spare key was.
Got into the house, and finally fed the the fishes.
I kick myself now for calling the locksmith and cancelling. I got a different dispatcher who didn't sound so earnest. It was just a single "sorry" that you'd say like if you were shrugging your shoulders while telling someone "woops, it couldn't be helped."
I didn't feel like fighting for justice, because I was just so happy to be able to take a hot shower after sleeping in a thin sleeping bag in my mom's garage all night :-)
the first two paragraphs are worth it, but the rest is basically the locksmith didn't show up, on a particularly bad morning for them not to show up.
edit: paragraphs
edit 2: ummm.. paragraphs?
Not sure how that had anything to do with the original story; it didn't even have anything to do with a tip and minimally to do with a server, who had no fault at all.  Thanks for wasting 3 minutes of my life zzzzzzzz
- do not bother reading this post, it's boring
while technically correct (the best kind of correct) your makes it sound like you're an asshole.
That was the most hilarious I've ever clicked.
We went to a subway one day a few years ago. We must have got there right when the employee was wanting to smoke. So im trying to figure out what i want and subway jerkoff says "are you guys going to order soon? i have stuff to do." in a really rude tone so we order. Were sitting there eating he walks by to go smoke and under his breath mutters "fuck you". Only me and one buddy heard it the other two didnt. So i immediately went up to the front and asked for the manager who insisted i was lying and told us we needed to leave before she called the police! Being a bunch of stoner we just got the fuck outta there. I was assured by the nice lady i talked to that the manager would be fired. :)
Guy at subway said "fuck you" i complained the manager called me a liar and threatened to call the police.
Last night I was working as a drinks waiter for a plumbers trade association conference thing. They talk about plumbing all afternoon and then have a nice buffet dinner and drinks afterwards, plus a few guest speakers unrelated to plumbing for entertainment. In this case, a retired star footballer and a comedian who I'd never heard of, but wasn't too bad at all. 
One of my tables asked immediately if there were spirits, I informed them that we had spirits on a cash basis (beer, wine and soft-drink were included free). They decided they were after Scotch. Scotch and Cola. I told them we have Teachers (house, not great), Johnnie Walker Black and Chivas Regal, which was more expensive. They decided they would **pay extra for Chivas even though they were mixing it with coke.** They drank two and a half bottles at $12.50 a glass, for a bill totaling about $637.50, they gave me $750 and said keep the change. The guy who paid said:
 "ha, don't worry mate, the boss isn't here but I've got his card"
**Pretty sure their boss is going to be extremely pissed off today when he finds out they charged $700 for scotch and cola to the company credit card.**
It's not customer service but it's my biggest WTF moment. 
About 4 years ago when I was a Senior in high school we found this cool area in the middle of the woods that we could call our hang out place. For weeks we were looking for a couch to put there and finally found one. 
While unloading the couch a whole family from one of the houses storms out and starts yelling at us that we are dumping. We tried to explain what we were doing but they weren't having any of it. They started taking pictures of us telling us they'll call the police. 
We didn't want any police called or anything so we pack the couch up and begin to leave. As we're leaving we yell out "Sorry for any trouble we caused". Well we keep driving and out of nowhere this car cuts us off and the guys storms out yelling at us and threatening us. He punched my passenger window. We were so confused we asked why are you so mad. He thought we yelled out "YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE". 
He keeps yelling at me and the flashes a gun that he has on his waste takes a picture of my license plate and drives off. 
My friends and I were so confused as to what had just happened. We just went back another day and put the couch out there. Many nights were spent getting drunk there. XD
Person thought we yelled "You're looking for trouble" Proceeds to punch window and flash gun at us.  
Was at a resteraunt a few months back with a few friends after we had all finished our GCSE drama performances and went out to celebrate.
well the guy that served us was a nice guy, got all our orders and stuff correct. as we were ordering desert he overheard me make a joke, when he came over to ask us what we wanted he replies, ''Thats what your mum would like... in bed!''
we were all like wtf?
the rest of the time there he just pulled off the weirdest jokes everytime he came to the table.
after a while we decide its time to leave and ask for the bill.
seeing as we are all carrying cash and no one was smart enough to calculate what we had we just decided to split it fairly, as we leave he comes up and says ''Thanks guys, would you lot like some ballons?''
we all just went ape shit for those ballons. we decided that this guy was too awesome to not give him a big tip. we went back to the table and gave him a nifty £70 tip.
as we were walking down the road he sees the tip and runs out screaming accross the road ''IF I WAS GAY I WOULD GIVE ALL OF YOU BJ'S''
- Epic waiter made your mum jokes and wanted our dicks
One time, my Xbox Live account got hacked, and someone tried to buy almost $200 dollars worth of microsoft points on my account, with the credit card that was on my account. The bank, unsurprisingly, turned down this random slew of huge charges from microsoft, and microsoft, in turn, froze my Live account. I jumped through every damn hoop, entered all the information on the account reclamation website, and was repeatedly told that they could not verify that the account I was trying to get back was, in fact, mine. I was told that I would have to wait, at most, twenty-five days to regain control of my account. After a month, I called them, and they said the investigation was "ongoing". Half a month later, I called them again, and the man I was talking to said, "Your account access email was sent to you two days after you last called, did you not receive it?" I checked my email, and told him that no, I had not received any email. He then checked and simply said, "Oh. I guess it was never sent."
 XBL account got hacked so a guy could play FIFA, and my account was locked for twice as long as it should have been.
I was 19 and living in Florida and was trying to buy cigarettes at WalMart. I hand the cashier my Florida ID and she starts studying it for a while. After about 3 minutes she calls over her coworker and asks what she thinks. The coworker takes one look at it and says "it looks fine to me, but it's your call". The original cashier looks at my ID for another minute than finally hands it back to me saying "sorry I just don't feel comfortable selling to you."
I got my real instate ID rejected at Walmart for trying to buy cigarettes at 19. 
haha upvote for your   I applaud sir. 
Went to a gas station close by and asked that $20 be put into my tank, the attendant takes my card while the gas is being filled and goes to charge my card elsewhere. He comes back and has a $20 charge on my card, but for some reason the tank was still getting filled, I ended up with $5 more being put into my tank, and he asks for the money. I don't have any cash on me and say hey you made a mistake, I'm not correcting your mistake. He starts yelling and basically throws my stuff back at me. I'm thinking never coming here again... 
Flash forward like 2 weeks. I've gotta go to the same gas station, because it's late at night and I'm out driving and desperately need gas. I get the same attendant, and he recognizes me and tries to refuse me service because he fucked up. He says the only way he's going to give me gas is if I pay HIM $5 after I fill up the tank. I'm fucking pissed. I say I'll do it, and to just give me $20 in my tank again. he does it. and then I go to give him the $20 and he asks for the extra five. I scream at him I'm not giving you $5 because you fucked up the last time you gave me gas. Drove off, Haven't been back there since
Guy gave me $5 extra gas, wanted me to cover his mistake, remembered me 2 weeks later, almost didn't give me gas, gave it to me asked for the $5 that he mistakenly gave me. I told him to fuck off
Been reading through a lot of these and giving karma out sparingly. Gave you an upvote purely due to the humorous  Good work.
When I was a young kid I went with a friend and his extended family out to dinner. Friend's aunt was being extremely snobbish and rude to the waiter all evening. 
She started complaining that her water wasn't cold enough (yeah really) and she needed more lemons. At this point I said something along the lines of "Jesus Christ just freaking deal with it and stop complaining about every little thing."
The table went quite and the waiter quickly left. I went on playing 'hangman' with my friend like nothing had happened. Eventually conversation started again and dinner continued. 
The waiter gave me a big smile and the peace sign as we left. 
Waiter thanks kid who calls out someone for being a bitch. 
That would be the best for this
That's a great right there.
Upvoting for the story, but your was my reddit cheesecake
You got downvotes because most of the servers on reddit are this guy.
Don't even worry about it. They suck.
You should also edit your to say no *bonus* tip.
As an American who lived in Japan for a year where tipping is not a part of the culture at all, I can confidently say that I think the practice of tipping is a bad idea. What started as a gesture of appreciation for good service has been institutionalized and the customers suffer for it. Here's why:
* Because waiters get tips, their minimum wage is lower than other positions. This means that they depend on tips to make any real money. While there is potential for greater reward for truly attentive servers, servers in general have a sense of entitlement that they should receive a proper tip regardless of the quality if service.
* Good servers still get stiffed by douchey customers. Bad servers still get 20% tips because that's what is expected or because the party is large enough to warrant an included gratuity.
* If a server is working to earn a tip, their only focus is their own tables. Restaurants often state that servers are to help any customer if asked, but this is often not the case. In Japan, if you need something, you can ask anyone because **they all work for the same restaurant where you are eating.**
* Splitting a check when there is no tip is easy and you avoid all of the problem people have listed in this thread, like one person not tipping because someone else tipped well etc. In Japan, tax is factored into each item so splitting a check is a matter of simple addition rather than an algebra problem.
* Overall, I think tipping has not led to a general increase in the quality of service, and may have even led to a general decrease. It seems like you end up paying an extra 20% for a service that should already be provided since a restaurant is a business that caters to its customers. Instead, I think restaurants should pay servers proper wages and expect them to provide proper service because *that's their job.*
**Note:** I have worked in a restaurant in a position where I was paid a proper hourly wage, not a server wage, but had the opportunity to earn some tips. (Think bartender but a milkshake bar, so no alcohol.) I know how nice it is to get a good tip, and how much it sucks to get stiffed. I'm just glad I didn't depend on tips to make money. I also tip well when I eat out because I know what it's like to be a server. I know comparing America and Japan is apples and oranges, but I was truly impressed by the restaurant system there and ate out more frequently as a result.
** tipping blows.**
I remember when I was younger, I think I was on my way home with my mom and she took me to McDonalds. We ordered to take out and I specifically asked for a McFlurry so she got me one (I was about 5 or 6 at the time). Anyway, we got home and I went inside and started watching Ghostbusters 2 and began eating my burger and fries. After I'd finished I wanted my McFlurry. There was no McFlurry in the bag. I was pissed.  
tldr I want my McFlurry
I know this will get buried, and sorry for the wall of text... but: 
A month or so ago my boyfriend was called to the Bar (aka became an officially unemployed lawyer) and my family and his family went out for a celebratory dinner. The restaurant was a tired, typical everything sorta place (which I did not choose, because i am a persnickety food snob and I would have chosen something with better chowhound reviews). 
Meal starts fine, orders are placed. Many people in our party of 8 order steaks and request them medium-rare when asked by the server how they should be cooked. Apps come out, they are bland but not bad. Soon our mains come out. The meat is undeniably over-cooked - at least medium, if not medium-well. This is unfortunate but no one wanted to wait for new steaks so we just went about our eating. When the waiter came to see how the food was, someone mentioned to him that the meat was cooked more than we had requested. Apparently, this was a bad move. The waiter got super agitated and started telling us it was "supposed to be that way" and that their steaks are great and that nothing is wrong. We argue back a bit but get tired of it and we ask if we can go about eating our meals. The waiter then goes to tell his manager about our complaint. The manager comes to us and asks how everything is (did he think he was going to get a new answer?). My bf shows him his steaks and asks the manager how he would say it is cooked. the manager answers "medium." At this point, the manager could have just said sorry about that and we would have been content. Instead he starts ranting about how perfectly aged their steaks were and that our steak was in fact, cooked perfectly and we should just enjoy it. He's being a serious downer on the mood at the table at this point. People are getting disgruntled. We ask if he can please let us eat so he walks away... and then comes back to our table with a big, RAW steak sitting open on a plate (garnished with a lovely sprig of parsley!) and tries to make some argument of how it is so perfect - can't we tell? This must have been against some health code violation to parade raw meat around our table. This was NOT one of those steakhouses where they let you choose your steak raw. I continue to not get what the relevance of this craziness is - how the steak was aged didnt change the fact that they over cooked it!!! He keeps yelling at us until the new-lawyer at the table gets pissed and starts yelling back to just leave us alone. Finally, he removes himself and the raw meat from our table. 2 of us had ordered off of a 3-course prix-fixe menu that came with dessert. We chose to leave without getting said dessert. They eventually attempted to rectify the situation by giving us a $50 gift card, which is the solution to restaurant ordeals that i hate most since it means I would have to go back to the place in question!! 
When I got home and went to write my bad reviews on all sites that I could think of, I found other diner's reviews that corraborated my experience. Should have read those more carefully before dinner. 
Go for a nice dinner with my fam and the bf's fam, steak is over-cooked, waiter and manager freak out, raw steak is brought to table, I leave without dessert. 
A friend of mine desperately wanted to go to a restaurant a few days after she gave birth so I took her out to lunch.  She's got naturally large breasts and post-childbirth they were MASSIVE.  The waiter ignored me that entire lunch.  She had to order my food, ask for drink refills for me, and ask for a new fork for me because I'm clumsy and dropped it.  He finally noticed me when I handed him my card for the bill and realized that he'd fucked himself out of a tip.  She wasn't even wearing a low-cut shirt.  
Waiter fucked himself out of a tip because he was too distracted by my friends boobs to take my order.
The target credit card has target as its own issuer, so they can do things differently than normal issuers (Chase, Citibank, etc). They aren't part of the visa/MC association, so things can and will be very different from what is a very normalized process elsewhere. I imagine they also get away with it because of the severe limitations on the card — credit limit of under 500 usually, and can only be used at Target.
In this case, all they needed was the DL# as that links to enough information to link it to your credit.
target cards are weird and don't need SSNs.
I was sick of my old car and thought it was time for a new one after driving it for 8 years. I quickly drew up a short list with a few cars. The list wasn't long as i was looking for a convertible. I went to my local Audi dealer. When i entered the dealership, a salesman approached me, greeted me and asked what i was looking for. After explaining to him, he said "Oh... Well, i think you can't afford that. But let's have a look in the used car section. I'm sure we'll find something nice for you". I was kind of flabbergasted. It was not like i was sloppily dressed, but i guess wearing a neat Jeans and a Blouse still makes you underdressed for Audi. Anyway, i insisted not to go for the used cars. He shook his head, said "Whatever" and left me alone. Normally i should have left, but i wanted to have a glimpse on the car i was looking for and i was too lazy to look for another dealership. When i was done, i approached the salesman because i wanted to ask for a test drive. Apparently that wasn't possible. He said "It's the policy that you can only get a test drive when you signed the papers already". Yeah, right... Like i buy a pig in a poke. But i got the message and left.
I'm driving now a BMW Z4. I regret nothing.
Audi apparently sold enough cars.
I ordered chinese take out delivered to my apt. I've ordered from this place several times, love their food. My apt complex is one of those that has split addresses so it gets confusing for delivery drivers. I gave very specific, very easy driving directions (from their restaurant to my front door.) About an hour later, delivery dude calls me and says he's lost (in very broken english.) i walk out to the parking area and try to find him. no luck. it was cold and rainy but i was in a good mood and asked him to just meet me at the front gate. i walked all the way up there and he wasn't there. turns out he was at the wrong complex. since he barely spoke english, i couldn't even understand where he was. i stood outside for about 20 minutes trying my hardest to get him to my gate, to no avail. I finally went back inside and called the restaurant. i told them that he was lost and that i couldn't understand him so i asked if they could give him directions. they did. i didn't get my food for another hour. And by that point, i was pissed and starving. so the guy comes and gives me my food and i don't tip him. I hate doing that, but after waiting 2 and a half hours, i didn't feel a tip was earned. The guy ASKS me for a tip. I said no. He said that he was lost and that i gave him shitty directions. I said sorry and closed the door. He walked away and yelled at me in a foreign language through my open window. I was so shocked, called the restaurant and talked to the mgr. she apologized and explained he was new to the country. gave a discount and offered a discount on my next order too. i was satisfied, like i said, i love this place. sit down and start eating...and my phone rings...with the delivery guy's number. i have my boyfriend answer. the guy yells at him again! i reported him to the mgr again and she apologized again. scared the shit outta me since he knows where i live, but i find comfort in knowing he doesn't know how to get there, even if it's spelled out.
 chinese take out guy takes 2.5 hrs to deliver, yells at me for not tipping then calls my cell and yells at me again.
I'm very late to the party, but here it goes.
I was out with my 2 friends and my brother, we decided to hit up our favorite bar/grill. We had been there several times before, loved it, great service, left several large tips. But recently they had added a new waiter to their staff, he did a good job at service but something seemed off about him. It might have been his remark about me finishing this epic large double cheese burger in 10 min. He literally told me "WOW, GOOD JOB!!" what am I a fucking dog? No i was just fucking hungry.
So we go the next time we hope for our original waitress then fuck, here comes douschnozzle. He takes our drink order, pours our beer (badly I might add), and then he comes to take our food order. Well, as my brother his ordering, he asks for the hell burger and some fried PICKLES, so the guy asks "Have you ever had that before?" well no but who gives a shit. So he goes around the table, gets to me, order my burger but no fries cause I am going to share the pickles with my brother." So you want a order of fried pickles?".... "No, I'm going to share with him..."    "But he didn't order fried pickles"... I look around to the rest of my friends with the 'Are you fucking kidding me face'. "He asked for fried vegetables." Da fuck? "No he didn't, he asked for fried pickles, we all heard him. "UH, then why did I write down fried vegetables?"  I wanted so badly to say cause you are a fucking idiot, and why the fuck are you arguing with us, just change the order. But I'm a pussy. "Well he said fried pickles." ... "No he didn't". Then my friend who was off in the corner, quiet, never says much blurts out "Well he wants fried pickles now, so change it" guy shuts up, we enjoy our meal, we left a shitty tip. And now because of him we don't want to go back there anymore.
****Waiter heard wrong and instead of correcting he argued with us 
In response to the dirt leg comment here's the context of where that clame from.
My sister and her girlfriend threw a garage party one night.  A girl was there that they kind of knew but she came with a friend who was actually invited.  So she was a 3rd party invite.  No big deal, as long as she's cool.   Well, everyone is having fun bad getting along but the new chick gets drunk and starts hitting on everyone... guy and girl alike.  She did not want to go home alone... maybe scared of the dark??  Anyway, about 2 am girl is drunk sitting on the floor and my sister's gf had had enough of this girl.  She gets on the Mic (we had ghetto drunk karaoke) and she just starts yelling... "DIRT LEG... GO HOME... GO THE FUCK HONE DIRT LEG!!"  Just constantly harassing her and calling her dirt leg.  
Eventually my fiance goes uo to the girl aka dirt leg, and says.. "honey, I think it's best if you go home now.. " helps her up and sends her off with the friend she came with.  
And that's the story of dirt leg..

TL; DR. Dirt leg was yelled by angry lesbian at garage party.  
Not my story but my dad's, he went to this place called 'Cafe Rafael' which was either in NYC or Toronto, I can't remember which. It was a really fancy, expensive place; the kind where they won't let you in if you're wearing jeans/cutoffs etc. It's also the kind of place you'd expect to bend over backwards to serve you properly. He went with a few business associates(clearly not a date or anything to warrant being left alone) and after taking the order the waiter didn't show up for about 75 minutes. The food finally came after that time and according to my dad it was cold, and it tasted like it had been sitting in a hot plate for the hour it was cooked. He ate the meal, paid the bill, and given that this was an expensive place the waiters expect a big tip. My dad tipped low on a big bill($90 a person I think) and as he was walking out, the waiter said to him with a really snarky French accent, 'Was zere something wrong wiz ze meal sir?' at which point the whole place went quiet, as the waiter had said it quite boldly. My dad, "Yes. It was cold and it was late." To which everyone in the restaurant gave him a standing ovation.
My dad gets late, cold food at an expensive downtown restaurant, tells off the waiter, and gets a standing ovation.
I worked at a subway a few months ago.  It was fairly late, so just me and another girl were working, she was leaving in about an hour and  was closing, so I'd be there for another two.  She was sweeping up by the register and talking to a friend that had walked in, the subway was in a Walmart.  I was in the back area prepping more steak because we had run out.  So after about 10-15 minutes, I walk out into the sandwich-making area.  There's a dude standing there, and he looks PISSED.  I ask if he needs something, to which he replies that he's been standing there for ten minutes, and that when he tried to get my coworkers attention, she put up a finger and told him to wait, then continued her conversation.  So I apologized for his wait, explaining that I couldn't see him from where I'd been but that I assumed since my coworker was still chatting away that there was no one there.  He nodded, and ordered two fairly simple sandwiches, he wasn't rude or anything, just annoyed by the wait.  As I was ringing him up, he handed me a five and thanked me for doing my job well, when all I had done was what I get paid for.  I tried to explain that, saying a tip was unnecessary, but he would have none of it.  He insisted I accept it, saying he'd be offended if I didn't, jokingly saying he'd report me for arguing with him if I didn't.  He made my day, he was so nice, and the fact that she had made him wait when it would've taken all of five minutes to help him or even ask me to do it disgusted me.  I saw him in there numerous times before I quit, he recognized me everytime and would chat with me before leaving.  I finally quit because the store owner was incompetent and our manager had quit so the entire place was chaotic.  I believe she still works there.
 coworker at Subway blows off a customer for ten minutes to stand and talk to her friend right in front of him, I helped him and got a $5 tip just for doing what I'm supposed to.
Went to a rock concert at the Meridian in Houston while visiting friends and family, got carded at the bar (im late 20's and look even older), and almost get detained and arrested for having a 'fake ID' (Arizona Drivers License with 50 year expiration), the HPD guy working the joint agrees with the tard bartender that because my AZ license expires in 2042, it seems unreasonable and therefore must be fake.  
Eventually I talk him into going down to his car and running the license # to ensure that it is in fact real. 
Finally HPD guy escorts me to his cruiser huffing and puffing own two flights of stairs and has to call in to get help from his dispatch on how to even process out of state ID's.  Surprise, surprise its legit and he escorts me back inside.  He even tells the bartender that its real and that I am in fact a bit past 21, she still refuses to serve me now citing the Meridian's policy to refuse service to anyone for any reason, etc.
Meridian in Houston has asshole bartenders, and AZ licenses are trouble.

My parents and I decided to try a new, trendy pizza place right around the corner from my apartment one night last month. We decide to sit outside because the weather was nice and they had a big patio and a side deck. Everyone working at this place had an attitude, from the hostess who seated us to the waitress taking our orders. They made us feel like a huge inconvenience, but we were hungry and had heard the pizza was good so we tried to look past that.   
As soon as we are seated on the patio the girl offers to lower the shades because the sun was setting and was directly in our line of sight. We say that would be great and a guy comes out and lowers the blinds for us. We order our drinks and look over the menu.   
Not even five minutes later a young guy comes to our table incredibly pissed off that the blinds were lowered. In a very condescending manner, he tells us that he's going to have to raise the blinds because they trap heat in the patio ultimately raising the patio temperature about 20 degrees. My dad *politely* tells him that the sun is in our eyes and that they really shouldn't offer to lower the shades if it's going to cause a problem. The guy snaps. He is incredibly disrespectful toward my father and goes on a tangent assuring us that the sun would set and even going as far as to take his sunglasses off of his head and offering them to my dad. He's young, maybe 25, and treating us like we're imbeciles saying that our request to lower the shades would make the other customers less comfortable. Whatever, they raise the blinds and we question whether or not we'll stay to order food.   
We stay. Our drinks arrive and we take a few more minutes to look over the menu. The waitress is nowhere to be found. We sit they in awkward silence trying to get past what had just happened. Other tables are seated and the hostess offers to lower the shades for each table. We finish our drinks and the waitress still hasn't returned to take our order. We contemplate leaving but she finally shows and we order.   
The food came out cold, but one of the managers was walking around asking how everything was. We told him about the sunglasses prick and he was furious.   
I haven't seen the guy working there since.  
  
TL,DR: Entitled douche treats us like shit, most likely got fired.
My WTF moment in customer service history:
I had some money and personal items stolen out of my hotel room while vacationing in Mexico. The day we had to catch our flight was the day I noticed it had all gone missing. Some of the memorabilia I had bought for friends, along with 80$ American and some expensive makeup. I was 18 at the time and I was absolutely devastated. The hotel refused to help in anyway, and I KNOW It had been there before breakfast and our room was cleaned. 
So I headed to the airport sadly, completely bummed about an otherwise awesome trip. At the check in at the airport, the guy asked why I was so glum, and I told him what happened. Without saying a word, the guy upgraded my plane ticket to a first class ticket. Free of charge! I was riding coach before that.  I didn't realize what he had Done. I glumly accepted my ticket and made my way to the boarding gate. 
While waiting for the plane, there was this incredibly rude woman who glared at the entire time for no apparent reason. I asked her for the time, and she scoffed at me and took another seat. I could hear her criticizing what I was wearing and how 'trashy' she thought I looked. Jealous bitch. 
Anyways,  when they started calling up passengers by class, I looked down at my ticket, and noticed that my seats were being called for first class. Dumbfounded, I grabbed my bags and sat my ass down in first class. I was ecstatic about the twist ending to my vacation. 
And the bitch that turned up her nose at me? I had the pleasure of staring her down as she walked by me in first class and sheepishly avoided eye contact as she shuffled back to her coach seat. 
stuff got stolen from my hotel the day I was going home from Mexico, kind agent at the airport upgraded my ticket to first class without telling me - I found out what he did when I was boarding the plane. 
Edit: for those of you wondering, this happened 6 years ago, and the guy was working for Alaskan airlines. I'm sure if I would have written the airline to thank him, he could have possibly gotten fired as upgrading a passenger to first class at no charge for no reason could cost him his job. Either way, I thank him from the bottom of my heart of single-handedly making my trip turn out ok in the end. 
Edit 2: I realize now that apparently upgrading classes for free is normal. I guess I thought since he didn't say anything about it- he would have gotten in trouble for it. 
This was a few years ago when the Dark Knight came out. My dad and I were waiting in line to get into the theatre. We were both pretty excited, as seeing Batman movies together had been a tradition since I was a little kid. My dad and I are chatting when he said he hopes the show starts soon. 
At that point, the staff member motoring the line storms over and yells "what did you just call me?" Nothing, my dad said, we're just waiting to see the movie. Turns out the guy thought my dad had called him an asshole. 
"No, I know what I heard. I'm going to have to ask you to leave." I step in and say there's been a terrible misunderstanding. Then the staff says "get out, and take your shit of a son with you." Not wanting to make a scene in the line, my dad and I left. 
We went downstairs to the ticket counter, and ask to talk to the manager. My dad explained what happened,  what was said, and that seeing as we couldn't see the movie, we'd like our money back. 
The manager says that the employee had already called down to him, and said he believed him over us any day, and that we had to leave out else he'd call the cops. 
We ended up calling the head office, and told them what happened. Last we heard, both got sacked. 
father and son go to see Dark Knight, staff thinks he's called an asshole, manager backs him up, justice eventually served
**EDIT**: Wow, most upvoted comment ever. Not what I expected to get me the most upvotes, but Reddit is a strange beast.
A few asked did I ever get my money back. I answered it at one point, but I'll just put it here. We eventually got a gift card for what I believe was ten free movies (can't really remember, this was a few years ago). Ended up regifting it to a friend of mine, as I had forgotten it was their birthday and hadn't bought them anything.
My dad, now knowing what Reddit is, got a real kick out of some of the things you said about him. Despite some tough times, he's still my hero. [Here's one of my favourite pictures of the two of us]( earlier this year, when we went on vacation for the first time since I was a kid.
Also, to everyone asking where I got my shirt, I got it on [Threadless]( a couple years ago. I took a look today, but turns out that shirt is no longer available.
In America there is a place called "Denny's" and it is always open.  The food is so-so, the service is usually good.  The breakfasts and treats are pretty good.
My wife was very sick, and in the hospital.  One of those things where you spend days in the hospital just waiting to get better.  I would stay with her after work until the hospital shooed me out a couple of hours after the end of visiting hours.
Then I'd realize I'm tired and famished, stop to grab a bite at the local burger place then go home.  
Tonight was going to be different though, it was 9:30, and I wanted dinner.  Denny's it was!
I ordered the chicken fried steak with side veggies from the menu, and got a soda, and started reading a book as I waited for my order.
The book was really good.  40 minutes later, I realized I didn't have my food!
I called the waitress and asked how long it takes the chef to cook dinner, and she went to check.
She returned with my food, a very cold Chicken Sandwich with fries.
WTF?  Okay, apparently it's someone else's dinner.  So I complained.
She went back to the kitchen.  A few minutes later I see her walking out the door, and saying "Goodnight" to the other servers.
Another waitress comes to my table and asks me if I'm ready to give my order now.
I've rarely been this mad in a restaurant.  I was quietly furious, and asked what the hell happened to my chicken fried steak?  The new waitress didn't know so we got the manager over.
Apparently there had been a shift change.  New waitress, new cook.  Me left between the cracks.
So I told them, "Fine, I'll take my chicken fried steak dinner, on the house."
"I'm sorry sir," said the manager.  "It's after 10pm, and we don't serve some dinner items after 10."
"It was on the menu!"
"Yes, it is on our regular dinner menu, after 10PM we use the 'late night' menu."  
"I ordered my chicken fried steak BEFORE 10, so I expect that for dinner!"
"I'm sorry sir, but our day chef is gone.  Our night chef isn't familiar with that item."
That was it.  I made a scene.  I blew up and yelled at the manager.  Then I left.

It's just the system that kind of happened to happen, much like any other social system.  The servers make much less than minimum wage as their hourly pay.  The servers are supposed to report their tips, and if they don't make enough, the employer will pay them enough so that they are making minimum wage.  In practice, the wages usually just about cover the taxes on the tips.
It's pretty well known that 15-17% is a standard tip.  The really good servers will make quite a bit more, and the terrible ones will make less.  Since it's common knowledge, not tipping okay service at around 15% does in fact make you a cheapskate or a jerk.  The prices are (supposedly) lower to represent the service being paid for more directly, rather than to the company and back out to the server.
I can't say I've seen any scientific studies showing that it improves or hurts service in general.  One could guess that it pulls average service up a little because people don't want to make too little.  Sometimes people try to "protest the system" or whatever by tipping nothing, but it only screws over the poor college student trying to pay rent.
That's just the way it is, so tip properly in the US or you're a dick.
Got to say dude, that sounds like a real dick move. I've worked for McD's for a year now, and asking for a smoke is quite uncommon. If you had been less of an asshole to the guy, he probably would have given you back the change and your reciept. 
TL,DR; Asshole guy is quintessential "bad customer".
My family and I went to a sushi restaurant for my cousin's birthday. The service wasn't really that good, they gave us the wrong drinks and they forgot stuff that we asked for as soon as they walked away, so we gave the waitress like a $2 tip instead of the usual $5. As we're walking in the parking lot back to our car, the waitress runs after us and tells us that we didn't tip 15%! She's literally chasing after us. My uncle gives us this WTF? look and pretends that he is going to follow her back into the restaurant to pay. Then as soon as she goes through the door, my uncle starts sprinting to the car and we all run and jump inside and drive away. When I looked through the back window, I could see the waitress and her manager running after us but they couldn't catch up. Yeah, never went back there again.
 Crazy sushi waitress likes math.
My wife and I needed some furniture for our new house so we went couch shopping a couple of months ago.
Now that we are in our 30s, we are looking for pieces that are a little better quality and will last longer so we went to a “nicer” store.
Before our visit she had gone in with her folks to scout the place out and had been helped by a very nice salesman. This time when we walked in, that salesperson was not around and we were approached by someone very pushy and quite unfriendly. We politely told him we did not need any help as we were just looking. As we made our way around the store it was clear that this new rep was keeping a close eye out. He came over to offer his assistance once again at which point I told him that we would not be needing his help today and continued shopping. 
After about 30 minutes the wife and I had narrowed our search to a particular couch. As I was testing it out, my wife happened to see the salesman who had helped her and her folks. She walked across the store where he was just finishing with a customer and asked if he could help us. He recognized my wife and told her he would be over there in 1 minute to give us a hand. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, the second salesperson comes up to my wife and says “What do you think you are doing?”. My wife was surprised so she asked him what he meant. He said “You are supposed to be my customers. I haven’t taken any other Ups since you walked in, so how dare you talk to another rep”.
Well at this point I got up from the couch and walked over asking who the hell he thinks he’s talking to. He began arguing and telling me that I was supposed to be his commission and that I was cheating him out of money. At this point I just about lost it and thankfully the nice salesperson came, took me by the arm and defused the situation.
Needless to say that the manager and I had a nice long chat. 
The rest of the staff could not believe what he said to us and we could see them arguing with him at the other end of the store. 
I think he was just a bad salesperson who saw everyone else get sales, and that was the day he snapped. 
 Salesperson though it was my job to provide him with his commission. I had to inform him differently
I did something similar back in February.
For the Super Bowl, my friends and I went to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the game. Now, most people were either watching the game in their room or at home (we're mostly a commuter college), so the place wasn't very busy, maybe a 1/4 full with people leaving as the game goes on.
Our waitress showed up to our table first in a reasonable amount of time, takes our drink orders, brings them back, and asks if we're ready to order. Since we're watching the game, we tell her not quite yet and plan on ordering at the start of the second quarter. So we keep watching the game and finish our drinks, expecting our waitress (who isn't busy) to check on us. We sit at our table for about 20 minutes with empty glasses, waiting for her to come back. 
About half-way through the second quarter (so about 30 minutes after order our drinks), she comes and gets us refills, and says she'll be right back to take our order. 15 minutes later, she comes and takes our order, which is brought to our table. While she's there, we ask for refills again, and she says sure, and heads off. 20 minutes after she leaves to get us refills, she stops back by our table to see if we need anything, we tell her that we asked for refills and she heads off again. She returns 5 minutes later with our drinks. 
The second half is about to start, and our waitress disappears. We don't see her for the rest of the game, with the the exception of two times. The first time, I went up to the register, when I finally see her, and asked if we could get refills, and she says when she's done with whatever it is that she's doing (I think it was like rolling silverware). The second time, I again had to go to then register to *ask for our bills*, with about 5 minutes to go in the game. 
So for those of you unfamiliar with how long football lasts, we see our waitress twice in about 90 minutes. During all of this, there is another waitress whose table is just being rude. Spilling drinks, being loud, and at one point asked for a refund on the food they didn't eat. The other waitress handles all of this with class, while taking care of a full section. (our section, for contrast, had us and one other table occupied).
When we get our bills, we ask for the manager, and don't pay until he shows up. While he's at our table we explain that our waitress was at our table for a total of about 10 minutes in the 2 1/2 hours we were at the restaurant and that we wanted to tip the other waitress who, it seemed to us, was doing a phenomenal job with this terrible table. 
The manager takes our bills to cash them out and he brings them back to our table. Not a minute after he does so, our waitress stops by our table, slams the tip on the table (we paid cash), and says "I don't want this and neither does my friend".
 waitress doesn't do a good job, we try to tip another one who does, our original waitress gets pissed  
My buddy was a my place and ordered us some pizza to be delivered. The place was just down the street from the house, maybe a 7 minute drive if all the lights were against you.
So when I get a call asking if the delivery is to be made upstairs or downstairs I was confused. I told the driver the main entrance to the house is on the ground level, not up the side stairs.
He seems to understand. But, then I get a call a few minutes later from the driver saying "The old man at the house says that no one ordered a pizza." 
I ask what address he's at, he claims that its mine and I tell him, that's not my house because you aren't here, you are in the wrong neighborhood. (It's the only thing I could think of) 
He gets all belligerent claiming that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm confused about where I live, and I'm some sort of idiot.
So I try to reason with him, because we just wanted the pizza. But, about 10 minutes later he's calling again and the same thing happens. 
(By now an hour had gone by)
So I call up the pizza place to speak to the manager and complain about the drivers behavior, and refuse to speak to the driver again. The manager tries to smooth it over and says that the driver can't find the house. So I provide detailed directions (there are three turns involved) and he says they'll send a fresh pie.
We finally get it some ridiculous time later, I tell my friend who was buying that we should have refused to pay. But, he knew the driver....
 Delivery driver calls me an idiot and says I don't know where I live.  
A few months ago I had switched my cell phone ownership to my mom's name since my bf at the time and I broke up and I'm 17, so I can't legally sign for my own phone.
So I had 2 accounts at this point, both for the same phone. I had paid my old account accidentally instead of the new account. I owed $86.48 I paid it in full. Next thing I knew my phone was cut off 2 weeks after I paid it.
I called Koodo and I was talking to this guy Demitri. He asked me how much I paid for the last phone bill I said:
*"I think $85.67"* 
he said **"$86.48?"** 
I said *"Whoops, that sounds right. Is there any way you can transfer the payment over to my new account? I accidentally paid the old one."*
He said **"No. Your story just changed. You said you paid $85.67, now you're saying you paid $86.48. You're just copying what I'm saying."**
I said *"Sorry, I don't know the exact amount, I paid it over 2 weeks ago. I knew it was eighty-something. Anyway, can you just transfer my payment to the new account? I can't have my phone cut off, I don't have a home phone and I use this one for work."*
He said **"No. You are not the owner of this account."**
I said *"My mother is, but I always deal with all the payments and problems with my phone and no one has a problem because I can provide sufficient information."*
He said **"Oh yeah? What's her driver's license number?"** 
I said *"Well, of course I don't have that. Anyway, can you just transfer the $86.58 onto my new account?"*
He says **"NOW YOU'RE LYING. YOU KEEP CHANGING THE NUMBER."**
I said *"Do you remember the exact amount of something you paid over two weeks ago? Probably not."*
 Then we got into a screaming match, he hung up on me and I called back, spoke to another agent and she was able to do the transfer for me in less than 5 minutes. I told her about that assface and Koodo called me the next day and apologized. 
**** Koodo customer service guy was a total asshole.
EDIT: added words.
Since you decided to hit reply and address my reply to the guy that was complaining about having to tip I assumed you were in that camp as well.
So let me address your other point. I did comment that not it wouldn't be worth putting up with drunk people without being tipped and I stand by that comment.
 While it is not exactly the same as dealing with violent schizos, it would be naive to think someone working in a bar doesn't have to deal with irrational and violent people, that's the nature of alcohol. 
When you get a large group of people and add alcohol they devolve into wild animals acting only on their baser instincts. I deal with all kinds of people from your run of the mill angry drunks to the kids who don't know  their limits and puke anywhere and everywhere. We have to routinely break up fights and keep an eye out for shady dudes with rape in their eyes. 
Oh and when your not doing that every jack ass and their mother tries to tell you how to do your job. I realize its not rocket science but owning a drink recipe app on your iphone doesn't exactly give you job experience you yuppies. (that's not directed at you, but in general.)
Oh and if your going to order a mixed drink and then complain that it's weak because you can't taste the alcohol then you should be tarred and feathered and run out of town. You won't taste it if the BT is good at their job. If you want to taste the alcohol put down the 17 year old white girl drink and order Johnny Walker black, neat, like a fucking man and save me the effort.
Sorry, I'm just free styling now. Any rate, I was still fired up from before when you commented and I didn't quite read your comment thoroughly enough. I saw it, I didn't read it I guess. So I do apologize for being a dick, but while we're on the topic. Everyone has their own little cross to bear, don't assume your job is any less stressful than anyone elses.
Just to nail part of my original point home, you DO NOT have to tip at 90% of places. If you don't want to, you don't have to. I'd take a customer who doesn't tip but acts right over an asshole who tips any day.
*edit* an example would be British people. We get a lot of British folks where I work. British people don't tip, its not because they are cheap but they do not tip in the UK. I heard it has to do with gratuity already being included in the price but I've never asked anyone from the UK. So when I get someone from the UK I'm not getting a tip. I know that, but I also know they will not be rude like some of my fellow Americans and I know they know their limit and won't cause a scene. People from the UK are some of my favorite customers even though they don't tip. Not tipping is fine, but don't act like an entitled douche which is way too common in our culture. 
Also a pro tip, a spicy coke is captain morgan and coke. The first time one of those UK dudes said that to me I looked at him like he had a dick growing out of his forehead. Maybe this is common knowledge even in the U.S but I'd never heard it.
TL; DR- I will not subsidize your laziness by summing my rant in one sentence. Move on to the next comment. 
I was on a road trip with a few friends on our way to Bonnaroo. We had been driving since the crack of dawn and it was pretty late so we went to Denny's. I ordered the veggie burger. Waitress comes to give everyone their food. Realizing she didn't put any food in front of me she says, "What did you order again?" "The veggie burger." "Oh we're all out of those!" "...Okay could I just get some fries then?" Everyone is finished with their meals by the time she brings out my fries. Then she accidentally comped my friends' meal instead of mine. 
Oklahoma City Denny's sucks.
I had gone to this mexican place by my school. It was on man vs. food for some reason, but not really a popular place in town. Anyway, we go one afternoon and I think they were understaffed. Our waitress comes over and tells us she'll be right back to take our drink orders and explains that she's really busy and needs to take care of her other table first. Completely understandable. 
She comes over and asks what we want to drink, and me knowing that waiters like when ppl order drinks other than water decided to get something else. Two of my friends say water and she just goes okay water for the table and walks away. She didn't even bother to ask me or my friend.
Comes back with drinks and says I'll be back. I say "uhm excuse me, I..." and then she turns to me and literally yells, "I SAID I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!" and walks away. I was going to tell her I wanted to order an actual drink. Comes back doesn't apologize and continues being a complete bitch for the rest of the time there. I wanted to get up and walk out after she yelled, but didn't want to inconvenience my friends. I understand people have bad days, but don't be disrespectful and straight up rude, because I'm a college student. I was planning on giving her over 20% because she was busy, but after that she got a nice fuck you.
 busy waitress yells at me when I try to actually order a drink from her because she's too busy
Dell customer service was completely screwing with me a few months ago, it was an awful experience (warning: really long). Back in December or so, my sister accidentally bumped into my computer and it just died. My brother took a look at it and said that it would cost a bit of money to fix to replace the parts, and it was already kinda old, so we decided to just get a new desktop. There was a new Alienware model coming out in February, so my brother suggested I wait till then, so I ordered and went two months without a desktop.
It finally comes when I'm in class, so my brother sets it all up for me. I get home and I'm super excited to try it out...and it keeps randomly shutting down. Whenever it switched graphics cards, the computer would just turn off and we couldn't figure out why, but we suspected that it was a hardware issue rather than software. The next day, I call Dell tech support.
After an hour or so on the phone, the tech support person agrees that it's a hardware issue, and tells me she'll call back the next day. Next day passes and I get no call, so I just call customer service; they already said it's a hardware problem, so I just want to return it to them and get a new one (it's well within warranty). I call up the number I find online for returns, and give my info, and they say they have to transfer me. Fine. I get transferred, give my info and explain I want to return...and they transfer me again. And again. And again...I'm transferred 7 freaking times until I say "Look, I keep getting transferred and this is going nowhere, I just want to return this broken computer and get a new one. Can you please do that?", and the person apologizes, gives me a code that I write down, and transfers me again. After that last transfer, I ask "I just want to return this computer, can you do that?" and she says "yes, I can do that" so I'm thinking "Finally! I can get this over with!". She asks me for a code that someone else would have given me, and I say "yes, someone just gave me that code, it's &lt;insert code here&gt;". She pauses for a sec, and says "that's not the right code, that's a code from customer service. I need a code from tech support to prove that it's broken". I try to explain that it's definitely broken and I talked with tech support the day before, and they gave me no code, so she says that I either have to call tech support again and get a code, or I can return it without the code but it'll be a 15% stocking fee (as in, 15% of the total cost). By this point, it had been another 2 hours on the phone and I had to go, so I was getting extremely frustrated. I just said I'd call tech support again and I hung up. 
So I go to class and a few hours later, my brother calls me and said he took care of it (another 2 hours on the phone), and someone would come by to pick up my broken computer and ship a new one. I'm really happy that it's taken care of. 
Two weeks later, no one's come to pick it up and I'm still without a computer. And then Dell calls, and this happens (I wasn't home, my other brother answered the phone and told me what happened): 
Dell: Are you enjoying your new computer?
Brother: ...No, we still only have the broken one we got first, we never got the new one.
Dell: Oh yeah, that's right, we didn't ship it yet.
Brother: What? Why would you ask that then? You just lied to me.
Dell: I'm sorry. Anyway, we're waiting for a part to come in for your refurbished computer.
Brother: Excuse me? We didn't order a refurbished computer, we ordered a new one and we paid full price for it.
Dell: Oh yes, it looks like you're right.
Brother: What the hell are you talking about then? Is my brother getting his computer?
At this point, my mom, who had been listening, intervenes and tells them to cancel the order completely, we're done with this crap. So I get home, and find that after nearly 3 months without a computer, I'm now in the exact same situation I started in. I was not happy. We finally just went and bought a desktop in person from, of all places, Costco. 
The funny thing is that every person I talked to on the phone was unfailingly nice and polite, they were just extremely incompetent and did not help me at all.
Dell sends me a broken computer and puts me through a lot of crap as I try to return the defective one and get one that's not broken. 
There was one time where I was with my dad at this antique store when I was really little. This guy was there picking up a dresser that he had bought earlier and was arguing with the Korean owners that he was refusing to pay for it since it was now all scratched up. The conversation had to be done through a translator and what I got from it was that they admitted it had gotten really beat up in the back compared to earlier that day but he still needed to take it. They were getting really angry. The man was pretty calm through out the whole thing and finally just walked out and got into his car. One of the owners sat *right behind* the dude's car so he couldn't back up without running him over and another stood in front of the car so he could ride forward either to get away. I think he was blocked on all sides. The guy's girlfriend was freaking out the car and was crying on the phone with someone. This lasted for a while until I believe a friend of theirs came to rescue them. 
 Antique store incident made me afraid of Koreans for a while. 

The people at The Exchange in Oakland, Pittsburgh not only didn't have cords to test a DVD player I wanted to sell, but they failed to put the remote back in the box and I didn't notice it until I got to Squirrel hill. Then the lady there called down, told me he said he wrapoped it up in the cellophane/foam, and when it wasn't there and I asked her to call to check again she started to freak out. She also said that she didn't even know if he was there... even though she just claimed that she spoke with him and that he said the remote was wrapped up in the box. When I attempted to point out how both of those statements couldn't be true at the same time she started interrupting me, yelling at me, making irrelevant statements, making up more lies, called the police... I finally went back down to Oakland and didn't see the guy down there check for anything when I went back down. Police show up because I say I just want to wait for them and make a report. I called back the next day and asked them to check the security tapes and have the manager/owner call me back. Still nothing.
TLDR - The Exchange lost my DVD player remote, screamed at me when I asked another store to call the first one and tell them to look for it, the police get involved, and I get ignored. Oh, and the DVD player is worthless now without the remote because I can't use it and they won't buy it without the remote.
My worst customer service situation occurred at the local Hour Eyes. I had an appointment to go get a prescription and glasses, and was waiting for about 45 minutes past my appointment time when someone finally told me that the doctor had not come in on time, and that they could not contact him. They then had me wait an additional 30-40 minutes before having me reschedule. The wait, while annoying, didn't really bother me that much, but their lack of communication, and general rudeness did.
I came in for my next appointment, and waited another hour and a half before I was finally called back. They were also quite rude during the entire appointment and choice of glasses. After everything is done, I buy a pair of glasses, and they give me a receipt with a survey you can take on their customer service. So I get home and decide to do the survey (because it enters you into a competition to win $1000, and I'm a sucker). I give average ratings, giving a 6-7 on almost every question (which I believe was being generous), and explain the issue with waiting that I had in the comments section.
This is where the truly bad customer service starts. About a week later, i get a call telling me that my glasses are ready to be picked up. Then she goes on a huge rant about how she can't believe I didn't give them perfect scores on the survey, and that I was so nice when i was there, why would I not give them better scores? She basically yelled at me for a full three or four minutes about the scores that they received, and told me I needed to retake the survey and give them all tens. Then when I was in the store to pick up the glasses, all four employees there proceeded to barricade me with complaints and disbelief at the scores. The entire time until I left, they would not back down until I promised I would try to retake the survey for them. Needless to say, I did not go back to that eye glasses store!
TLDR, Hour Eyes employees berated me for giving them scores of 6-7 on their customer service survey, after giving me customer service that deserved far worse scores.

A few weeks ago me and two co workers went to a small restaurant for our lunch break. We were the first ones there since it was just past twelve o'clock. The cashier guy/our waiter looked angry that we interrupted his laptop time and actually had to do his job. He (rudely) took our orders and slammed our food/drinks on the table when he brought them. We thanked him each time he brought us our orders trying to be polite even though he was a jerk. Eventually more people came into the restaurant. When we were finished we needed some to go boxes but whenever I tried to get his attention he'd ignore us. Eventually I go up and ask him for boxes. He doesn't acknowledge anything I said so I awkwardly stand there for a few more seconds then sit down. After several minutes he gives someone else their food then grabs some to go boxes and throws them on our table. We go up to pay and he lumps our orders together. We ask to pay separately and he let's out a huge groan. My friend and I pay cash and my other friend pays with his card. The waiter prints the receipt and slams it on the table. Then he grabs a pen, lifts it above his head, and also slams it on the table. The service was horrible and so my friend didn't want to leave him a tip. He writes a zero with a line through it on the tip line and accidentally rips the receipt. He puts the receipt on the table and as we're walking out the waiter yells out "I like your tip, fucker!" My friend responds with "I loved your service!" Waiter yells out "Yeah, I love you too, fucker!" We were so shocked we just left.
waiter called my friend a fucker, twice.
Reminds me of a nice trip I took from the Netherlands to England, using the ferry from the Hook to Harwich, on my way to London. I arrived at Harwich International at around 7-8 PM local, and look at the train timetable. Trains to London are suspended that day. Alright, my bad, should've figured that out beforehand, apparently they don't go on Sundays. 
I go inside, ask the women at the ticked office for the boat if they have any ideas. They tell me to go to the ticket office for the bus. I go there, it's closed, because again, it's sunday. I go back to the ladies, they become snotty with me and I'm starting to get desperate trying to not get stranded in a random place is fuck-knows-where England, and they tell me to just go to the bus and ask there. 
I walk a short walk to the bus, and the bus driver asks me for my ticket, which I don't ask. He tells me to buy it at the bus ticket office... Which is still closed. Apparently the tickets for the bus are only available if you get them included in the boat ticket, which I didn't do, because up until I arrived at Harwich I wasn't sure if I was going to London immediately or meeting a friend first. So eventually I'm sitting there stranded on Harwich International trying to figure out what to do, trying to call some of my contacts around there, but no luck.
Eventually, after a while of this, I just get on a train heading the right direction, figuring that if I have to wait somewhere till morning I might just as well spend some of the night getting as close as possible to where I need to be, and in a semi-warm train. Ended up getting help from a very friendly train conductor who got me a route involving 2 trains, a bus (that accidentally took a few wrong turns) and a metro ride to get to Heathrow. Eventually it was about 1 AM when I finally stood outside the station attempting to get a cab.
TL:DR: Had to interract with several really bad customer service people who were snotty if not downright rude in an attempt to get to London, eventually being helped by a nice train conductor but still taking ridiculously long to get there, partly by my own fault, I admit.
Okay, I'm late to this one, but I have a pretty good one in my opinion.
My mom and dad went to a Logan's Roadhouse and ordered some food (not a lot of detail, I know, stick with me though). The waitress is incredibly rude through the whole meal and obviously over-seated in her section. At the end of the meal my dad talks to the manager and he notes their complaint but offers nothing in return for the bad service. My dad asks for the owner's name (franchise) and leaves. He writes a letter to the owners and tells them about their experience. The owners write back and include two $50 gift cards for their trouble.
A month goes by and my parents finally go back, this time they get steaks though. My dad ordered his steak medium-rare and it comes out mooing and barely cooked. He asks to have it cooked longer and they take it back. The server brings it back out and this time the steak is undeniably well done. My dad has never liked well done steaks and asks if he can just have the meatloaf. They oblige, and bring him the meatloaf but it was cold. This has my dad all worked up and he asks to talk to the manager. This time it is a different manager and he apologizes and gives them all their meals for free. 
After this my dad went ahead and wrote the owner again, this time to let him know about the service, but to also let them know they have found a great manager. He specifically asks not to be sent more gift cards as he is just trying to inform them of the situation in their own restaurant from an outside point of view. Well the owners sent him another $50 gift card anyway so my dad just gives it to my wife and I.
We go in about 3 weeks after that and enjoy a great meal with a server my wife used to know in high school. The entire experience went smooth and at the end the manager (same guy as the second time my dad went in) comes up while our server is standing there and asks us how everything was. We jokingly said our server was very rude and immediately laugh and explain that we actually know her and that the service and food was great. We start chit-chatting with the manager more about customer complaints and he brings up a story about a particularly unruly customer he had a few weeks ago and begins to tell us the SAME STORY MY DAD TOLD US. The dude was talking about an angry shitty customer and he was talking about my dad and didn't even know it!!! Moral of the story, my dad is a dick.
Restaurant manager tells me a story about a shitty customer that happened to be my dad when he ate there several weeks before.
Edit: I accidentally a word.
I worked at Applebee's that was in a mall. At 1pm on a freaking Tuesday this lady comes in, sits at the bar, and she is WASTED. *She then put her infant seat with her baby on the stool next to her*. We were flabbergasted. She tried to order a drink, but obviously we wouldn't serve her, so she ordered a salad instead. We then watched as she *spoon fed blue cheese dressing to her infant*, while *she ate her salad without dressing with her hands.* This was all in the time it took for the cops we had called to show up.
 Some people should never, ever, be parents.
I work in a salon at which I just got hired less than two weeks ago. I was working yesterday when this middle aged woman came in and sat in a waiting chair. I was cleaning up after a perm I had just finished and noticed this woman looking through some of the style books that salons have sitting out. I finished cleaning and invited her to sit in my chair. The first thing that comes out of her mouth is "I don't know what I want." So I started checking her hair out to see what kind of layers and texture we were dealing with. She had essentially a "Farah Fawcett" haircut. 
She said " I just want it to blend when I blow dry it back, so it flows." and I said something to the effect of "okay well there are a couple things we could do." I explained the different kind of layers I could do and she didnt really seem to respond to anything I was saying. So I just started cutting her hair, very layered and textured. She kept leaning forward close to the mirror and pulling her hair out in different directions and pushing it around. 
She kept saying things like, "I don't cut hair. So I don't know how to say what I want," "I just wanted it to go back." I was already getting frustrated on top of being confused so I looked at my coworkers like "omg help." this lady turned around and looked at me and almost yelled, "Am I bothering you?!" the craziness went on like that for a while. She told me that I didn't know what I was doing several times, eventually one of the other stylists came over and started talking to the lady. She told me she was already having a bad day and "wasn't trying to be a bitch to anyone but that I'm incompetent and not listening to her." Eventually I finished and she seemed to be okay with the cut, she paid and left and I just cried. 
Gave a crazy lady a haircut, who then insulted me because she was having a bad day and didn't know how to describe what she wanted. 
So we went to Chinatown (me and about 3 other friends).  We're just high school students mind you, but after we eat our dinner and pay, we leave about..a $5 tip.  We did it because the service was pretty terrible and the food was eh.  We leave and shortly after our waitress runs after us and demands we pay more on the tip.  Demands as in she says shell never let us eat there again (we frequent chinatown a lot).  We end up paying, but I haven't been back to that restaurant/shit hole every again.  
To top it off, our friends have been to another one or two restaurants that have done the same exact thing.  
 Chinese food service is shitty and I'm ashamed of how cheap chinese people are.  (Me and my friends are chinese/grew up in chinatown)
I had a weird one a few years ago. 
My wife and I, and a couple of her brothers went out for coffee one evening.  I had just gotten off work and hadn't eaten, so I took a look at the menu and order beef frajolaki (seasoned steak with onions and tomatoes on a torpedo bun), and my wife ordered a turtle cheesecake with her coffee.
About 5-10 minutes after the waitress had taken our orders, another group of people sat down in the booth behind us.  The same waitress came up, chatted with them and grabbed their orders.
After about 20 minutes, out comes the cheesecake that my wife ordered.  No, wait, it's a cappuccino cheesecake.  My wife called the waitress back and told her about it, and the waitress apologized and offered to bring her the proper one out, but my wife liked it well enough so she said she'd just have the one that was brought to her.
Another 15-20 minutes go by, and I'm still waiting for my meal, getting a little pissed off by this point, when I spot the waitress coming our way, plates in hand.  Wait, plates?  I was the only one who ordered!  She walks by us and to the booth behind us and distributes the food.  Now I'm getting really ticked.  I hear the table behind me discussing their meals, and one of them asks another what he's eating, to which he replies "I don't know, but it's really good!".  Well, I thought, how the hell do you no know what you ordered?
Another 10 minutes go by, and I'm about ready to leave, when out comes the waitress, plate in hand.  She sets it in front of me and asks if there's anything else I need.  I look at the plate and back to her and say "Uh, this isn't what I ordered.  I ordered a beef frajolaki.  This is a beef dip."  She looks at the plate, then quickly looks at the booth behind us.  Yup, mystery guy who couldn't remember what he had ordered?  He was chowing down on my frajolaki.  Mistakes happen, and I'm pretty mellow, but when she said "Well, can't you just eat this instead", I asked for the cheque and got up and went outside to wait for my wife before I totally lost it.
To top it off, she tried to charge me for the beef dip.
I know I'm stupid and this is crazy, but you didn't order this, so eat it maybe?
EDIT: Wow, thanks for the upvotes everyone!
Back in November my wife bought a Fujifilm point-and-shoot camera as a Black Friday deal. It wasn't really a nice camera, but it was a good deal. A couple of months later the retractable lens on it jams halfway retracted, so that it can't go in or out anymore and the screen has an error message.
I go to their website to see how I can contact them to have the camera repaired under warranty. I shoot them an e-mail explaining the situation. Weeks go by and I never get a response. In the mean time my wife manages to get the lens to retract back in by spraying some compressed air around it.
The camera functions fine for a month or so, but when we're on vacation it jams again. When we get home my wife sends them another email. After a week and no response I call their 800 number. I go through all the automated crap to be directed to their "camera repair" department. A guy with a heavy accent answers and asks how he can help me. I tell him the model number of my camera and what it's doing. There's a brief pause and then he says, "You're going to need to send that to repairs." ....I say, "Okay, and can you tell me how to go about doing that?" He says, "OH! I'll put you through to their department." (Did I not just direct myself to that department with your automated answering service? Whatever...)
So after a brief hold a woman answers and asks, again, how I can be helped. I tell her my model number and problem and she says, "You're going to need to send that to us to have it repaired. What you'll need to do is go to Google and type in 'Fujifilm repair form' and send that in. Okay?" I say, "Wait you're telling me to Google you're repair form? Can't I just get it from your website?" She tells me I should just Google it. I then ask her, "So what do you actually do in your department if all your going to do is direct me to Google?" She tells me about how they have all kinds of lines for professional cameras and all this other stuff that doesn't really explain why she is simply directing me to Google and not talking to me about troubleshooting my camera or the entirety of the repair procedure.
After her brief "explanation" I say okaaaaay and ask, "So when I get the repair form from your website will it have informa...." She interrupts, "Just search Google for the repair form." I say, "Can I finish what I was saying? I understand that you want me to Google for the form, but won't Google searching it give me the result of finding the form on your website? Whether I search Google or however I find your form I will eventually obtain it from your website. Now, what I was saying was, when I fill out your form will it have information on how to have the camera repaired under warranty." There's a long pause on the other end until she finally replies, "Are you finished?" Irritated I say yes and she continues, "Just fill out the form and it should have everything you need on it." I give up and ask one last question, "How will I be updated on the status of the repair?" She says, "You'll have to call us seven days after sending your camera to see how it's going." I laugh, say okay and then tell her I think that takes care of my problem. We say bye and hang up.
I'm completely appalled. What I get from calling this companies customer service line after two ignored emails is zero information on how to have my camera repaired other than being directed to Google their form, a woman who is so frantic about supplying me this information (or lack of) that she get's short with me when try to get more details about how this whole process works, and after all this I'm going to need to pursue them after sending them my camera and try and get information from them about my repair? I don't think so. Needless to say I will NOT be Googling their form, I will NOT be sending my camera in, and I will NOT struggle through trying to get information from them on a repair. Never buying another Fujifilm product again.
- Had a broken camera, called company to get it repaired under warranty, rude phone operator directed me to Google to get their repair form rather than be tell me any information on their repair process, told I have to pursue their repair department to find any information on my repair.
So, I went to the drive thru of a Taco Bell and ordered a bean burrito, a taco and a large soda. The wait was super long, considering that it was well after the lunch rush (probably 2 pm-ish), but it was a beautiful day and I was in a great mood, so I hung out and read the newspaper as my car slowly got closer to the window. 
Finally I get to the pass thru window and the cashier seems to be having problems figuring out how much change to return from my twenty, first trying to give me a dollar and change (for a $4 something order, which doesn't even make sense) and then when I said the change was wrong, she had to call the manager. Then we got the payment straight and she hands me the food. I say "I also ordered a large soda." And she replies "We're out of large cups." And then starts to close the window. At that point, I had been in the drive through line for almost half an hour and my patience was wearing thin, so I said "Uh, so...what now?" She stops and looks at me and said "Well, what do you want ME to do about it?" I shrugged and said "I don't know? Give me a medium? Refund the money? Something?" I mean, soda is a tremendous ripoff in the first place, but I was kind of incredulous that she expected me to say "Oh, ok." and drive away having paid for a drink without getting anything. 
She slams the window closed and then she's gone forever. Then I can see her standing inside the restaurant, taking off the belt that has the intercom on it and storming out the doors. She crossed the drive thru in front of my car and double flips me off, screaming expletives. Apparently the lack of large soda cups had been her breaking point. The manager then comes in, asks what I'm waiting for, and I said "I ordered a large soda." He disappears for a minute and then comes back and says "We're out of large cups." Yeah. I know. I suggested a medium and he gives it to me. As I'm driving away, the disgraced cashier -- who has now walked about a quarter mile down the street -- sees my car and starts screaming at the top of her lungs that I'm a bitch, a c-word, etc.  
 Taco Bell runs out of large soda cups, cashier quits on the spot and flips me off.
I've worked as a Chef here in bars and restaurants in New Zealand, And tipping isn't a thing here at all. But I've always been one for if the customer wants something extra or done slightly differently, you just do it and get it done. Anyway one time we went to a place called lone star just for a day off thing with a few friends. After an near 30minute wait (Were I worked at the time we aimed to have food out in 12-14 minutes tops) I started looking around the place trying to see what was taking so long and I noticed the lady at the table next to us inquiring about her chicken. She was extremely calm and understanding to whatever the waiters reasoning was, but then explained that she understood what he meant working in a kitchen herself but she had had bad experiences with chicken before and would like it to be grilled even for just two minutes as it was slightly to pink for her liking. I was shocked when the waiter returned from the kitchen to inform her that the kitchen refused to do it as it was cooked fine. Needless to say her and her husband got up and left. It had been about 45 minutes by this point and our food finally started to arrive to the table. But turns out we only got half the food we ordered as the rest was only just been cooked now. Not willing to wait another 45minutes to eat we to walked out of that place. I can't say I will ever go back there again simply because the kitchen staff we useless. And I feel sorry for any front of house staff that ave to deal with kitchen staff like that as it cannot make their jobs easy at all.
I working as a chef feel sorry for any 'FOH staff that have to deal with shitty kitchen staff 
This'll be a long one. My social group has always been pretty big and when we all go out it's normally at least 12+ people. A friend from high school was visiting so we all went to dinner at a place I had my reservations about. While looking at the menu I thought the food was too overpriced and didn't look like all that. The waitress took our drink orders, and the guest ordered for a mixed drink that has rum in it, and specifically asked for Appleton State. The waitress took forever to come back with the drinks, and placed the drink of my friend saying "One with Matusalem" (another brand of rum). My friend was quick to point out "Oh actually I ordered Appleton", to which the waitress replied "Yeah well, that's the only thing we have" and promptly turned around and left. We all sat there with our jaws literally dropped and I said "So, if she brings a cup full of shit, you're supposed to drink it if that's all they have?". We all thought the service was awful throughout the whole dinner, food taking a lot to arrive the table, disdainful looks from the waitress, etc. Some of us (more than half of the group) decided not to leave any tip at all, the rest left less than 10% tip. We got up to leave and were *already out of restaurant property* when the waitress came running after us, and started giving shit to one of my friends because "GOOD ETIQUETTE dictates that in parties of more than 7 you have to tip 15%, it's the DECENT thing to do." My friend very calmly pointed out her service had been less than decent and we all left. 
**** Got a crappy waitress with a really bad attitude, decided not to tip *appropriately*, and she chased us outside the restaurant to give us lessons in etiquette.
I was at some shitty go kart place down south, when my brother and cousin decided to hop into the bounce house, there was a sign saying 12 and under, but they went anyway. They weren't jumping they just laid down, as there was no one else in there. Some guy comes up screaming and called my brother an idiot for not being able to read the sign. My dad comes screaming, calling him a toothless fuck and offered to kick his ass for him. 
 your dad is a man of patience. 
Eh, why not let me give a cute little story.
So my local diner (yes jersey) has this one waiter who is really odd. We usually went during night time like 11pm-1am. He just tried to talk to people all the time in a creeper like sense. I think he just wanted to be personable but just wasn't.
One day we happened to go around lunch time and he ended up being our waiter. He seemed really tired or something, I possibly assumed he might have been on an extended shift since I know he works nights. 
We tell him our order and after each of us tell him our order like a cheese burger with fries, he proceeds to write this down...for literally an entire minute. After he goes through all 4 of us, he leaves and we joke about it.
Five minutes later he comes back and asks what we ordered. Confused, we repeat our order and he leaves.
Another five minutes pass and a waitress comes by and apologizes but needs to re-take our order.
Nothing horribly scummy, but quite hilarious.
- Heavily drugged out waiter 
BWW has problems sometimes, but they're very good about making up for them. This past November some friends and I went for their half off with a college ID deal. I'm in a college town on the MN/ND border, so the promotion is always very busy. We got there, told the server how many and went out to wait at the end of the line. We were told it would be about 45 minutes. Okay, fine, cheap food is worth it. 45 minutes come and go and we are just getting inside the entry way. We go and ask how much longer it will be, we're told that it will be another half hour. Well, we've waited this long, we can wait a bit more. 45 minutes later and we're finally seated. I asked to talk to a manager, explained our situation, and we got our meals comped aside from drinks.
If you have a bad experience at BWW (or anywhere else really) explain the problem to a manager at the first opportunity. They'll often try to make it up to you. 
Hopefully someone can see this because I was infuriated for days.  3 weeks ago I was going through the process of buying my first car.  At first I was intent on buying used from a private owner, but as I discovered anything worth buying privately is bought before you can even contact the seller.  So I resigned to trying a used car dealership.  I went to a Nissan dealership near home.  The salesman who helped us was a typical used car salesman, trying too hard to make the sale and giving reasons like "because it's a nissan" for statements like the car having better gas mileage and not breaking down.  Typical bullshit, but he was nice enough and things were moving along.  That monday we were there for about 4 hours in total, looking at the car (Nissan Sentra) and putting down a refundable deposit so we could take it to a mechanic to get it checked out and make sure it was intact.  They offer to drive it over to our mechanic the next day.  Great, sounds good.  Before we left the manager agreed to a 1000$ discount that had just ended the day before, because the 9500 they were asking was out of my price range.  We agreed to a total price, after taxes, of 9195$, after taxes and a 100$ dealership charge.  I was very happy to have a price set and be essentially done pending an inspection.  Wednesday we come back with the clean bill of health from the mechanic and a cashiers check for 9195$.  They make us wait there for the "manager" (used car salesman tactics and all that BS).  My father and I were getting annoyed at waiting, so we sped the process along by being a bit aggressive.  The salesperson offers to charge the amount we were paying for in credit card now while we're waiting.  Great.  We finally get in to sign the paper work, and the manager puts a bill in front of us that says $10,500.  We tell him he must have the wrong contract, we had in non-formal writing that the final price would be 9195$.  He says no, theres an additional $1000 dollar dealership  fee that the salesman must have told us about (And proceeds to call me a liar when I'm telling him the salesman did no such thing), along with a couple optional add ons.  Except the optional things were not opt-in, but OPT-OUT and hidden in the bill with no prior warning!  We were visibly and verbally angry at this point, and told the manager to leave while we discussed these new problems.  We crossed off everything that we were not told about, and wrote on the bill the final price of $9200 and left saying if the car wouldn't be sold at that price, we were done and would like a refund and our information shredded.  They basically told us to fuck off, and we left.  To this day we have still been harassed daily by phone, text, email, and mail saying various things like you must come down to the dealership to have our credit card refunded, or that we stole the key to the car.  We have threatened legal action if any more contact was made, and that has stopped personal contact but I still receive "deals and promotions" emails daily from them, and the refund was never issued we had to explain the charge to the bank to get the refund.  I will never ever buy a Nissan in my life and will urge everyone I know to never buy a Nissan either, after getting shafted by this dealership and corporate who has not helped at all.
 Nissan dealer adds $1400 to the final price at the moment of signing the bill, then harasses our family and refuses to refund partially paid charge.
Sort of relevant story.  A few years ago, while travelling, my girlfriend and I decided to visit NY on our way back to Britain.  We were flying back from Melbourne and had the journey from hell, 10hr delay followed by 14hr flight, 6hr stopover then 7hr flight.  We landed in the morning and decided to ride the jet lag out till evening.  We decide to go out for a meal in the early evening by which time we're both spaced out, I'm struggling to remember the year, who the president is and are those my feet? Being British I wasn't that clear on the tipping etiquette, yes I should have read up more and my jet lag was rendering most brain functions void but I had hoped (naively) that the staff might help me on this front and I'd be able to wing it like I had for the previous 8 months travelling.
Anyways we stumble through the meal and come to pay, I leave a tip, a fairly healthy one I thought and get set to leave.  Waitress then comes over and proceeds to address me loudly like I'm some sort of alabaster retard in front of everyone else for being a cheapskate. Without a word I take out the presumed difference from wallet and leave it on the table and then walk out. I'd like to say I had some witty Rodger Moore-esque comeback or aside but I didn't. I went and bought a shitload of M&amp;Ms and fell asleep partially clothed for 12 hours on the hotel bed.
Boring story about a jet-lagged Brit who should probably have gone to sleep rather than taking on the service industry.
My boyfriend and I had just moved into our first apartment together about 7 years ago, and we were pleased to find that there was a greasy little burger joint within blocks. It had been there since the 70s, and even though the area was bad, we threw caution to the wind for some damn fried mushrooms and pastrami sandwiches.
After having been there 2 or 3 times, the girl working the window one night accused my boyfriend of previously having driven off without paying for his food.  Like I said...we had only recently moved to that city and LITERALLY didn't know anyone in the area.  Still, she insisted that he and a group of guys had come to the window, ordered some chili cheese burgers, and had sped off without paying.  First of all, I don't know many fast food joints that will hand you your food without first accepting payment.  I mean, I guess if they're trusting, but really? This place was located on a HORRIBLE street corner (think bums, drug dealers, and hookers) so I'd imagine they'd be a little guarded. Even if that weren't the case, as I mentioned, we didn't know a single damn soul in the area, and the only time he had ever been to that place was with me.  She THEN claimed that she had my boyfriend on video surveillance, caught in the act.  Naturally, we asked to see the tape.  She refused and INSISTED that we pay for the burgers he "stole". I was getting heated at this point and was basically screaming at her from the passenger seat because (as much as I love him) my boyfriend is a colossal pushover.  I even went so far as to describe the lady who had served us the last time we were there, and on what date we had stopped by. "Oh, that's my manager," the girl said, "and she wasn't working that night."
At this point, the fucking girl already had our money in her hands for the food we had just ordered (I think we gave her a $20) and was REFUSING to give us our change.  We demanded to speak to her supervisor, but she claimed that she wasn't on duty.  We then asked for her manager's name, so we could come back and speak to her the following day.  She further refused to give us this information.  Finally a gentleman working the grill came over to mediate the situation since I was raising my voice and other customers were staring.  I felt really bad for him because he barely spoke a lick of English, but he apologized to us, gave us our change, and we were on our way.  I immediately went home and filed a complaint with the BBB, and the next day, called to speak to the manager.  We were informed that the employee had been fired.  My guess is that she was accusing customers of stealing, and then, if they bent under pressure, she would pocket whatever money they gave her.  So ridiculous.  The other employees, though, had been largely unhelpful during the whole mess and a few of them even tried to back up this girl's story, accusing us of being thieves.  I was so livid during the entire exchange that I was getting cotton-mouth and was  literally shaking with anger.  At one point I thought of calling the police, but then my mind was flooded with memories of idiots who have called the cops over stupid shit at fast food restaurants, and I didn't want to make an ass out of myself. Although, I guess since technically she was refusing to give us our money, it might have been justified?
As a funny side note...ermm...my boyfriend is Asian, so...***ALL LOOK SAME?!***

**** Boyfriend accused of being caught on video stealing fast food, bitch drive-thru worker harassed us and refused to give change. Mistaken identity because he's Asian? O_o
This was back when I was in my third semester of college. Finals had just finished and I was in a strange funk from lack of sleep and not seeing friends for about two weeks straight. I was tired and nervous cause, fuck man, finals. Anyways, to relieve some stress I decided to go out with friends and eat some motherfucking hot wings. I gather a few of my closest friends and we head off to a certain owl-themed hot wing establishment.We get our menus and start chatting, looking at the menu and just chilling. Then our waitress comes over and does nothing. She smiles, kinda leans in and rests her arms and just stares at us. We were thrown off and after a good few minutes or so she finally asks us what we would like to drink. When she comes back with our drinks she does the same thing, so we just starts ordering because if shes not gonna do her job we may as well do it for her. We get our food (fried pickles and a ton fuck of wings) and we thinks things resume to normal. NOPE. This is the WTF moment. Remember, she hasn't engaged us the whole time we were there but she comes over half way through the dinner and does her little routine. Smiles, leans, stare. Then she looks me right in the eyes and eats one of the fried pickles. Looks over to my friend and again eats another one. She then giggles and leaves a table full of mortified customers. We just stopped eating at that point, ask for the bill and leave no tip. While we're trying to scramble away I must have pocketed her pen when I signed the receipt. Some fat-asshole-regular customer comes outside and asks for her pen. We give it back and he says something along the lines of "Guess kids these days don't know how to tip." and I respond with "Not for shitty service I don't!" I don't expect much when going out; I always tip a decent amount, even if service is slightly sub-par, because i know too many people who are servers and I know for a fact I could never deal with so much shit. But some things I expect is 1) being engaged by the person serving me (not staring at me) and 2) NOT HAVING THEM EAT MY FUCKING FOOD WITH HANDS THAT HAVE BEEN GOD KNOWS WHERE.
 Waitress ate food off our plates.
Oh God, THIS. It took me talking to, no exaggeration, NINE FUCKING PEOPLE to get my internet set up. I tried purchasing online, after seeing a pretty sweet deal listed there, but it wouldn't let me sign up because my address already had an account. Whatever, no biggie, I call their customer service line to get set up. I call on a cell phone, so I get sent to their call center for my home state, halfway across the country. Transfer me to another person. Still the wrong call center; I wanted internet and they only did TV (or something like that, don't remember exactly). Transfer (finally) to the right call center. They tell me the deal I saw on the internet is only valid if I sign up on the internet. So I hang up, go to the online chat, and they proceed to tell me what I already know; that there's already an account for my address. I say cancel it; they say they can't, I have to call their call center. Call them up, tell them to cancel the old account. They say it's done, then transfer me to (again) my home state's call center, and when trying to transfer me to the right one, they (I graciously offer them) *accidentally* disconnected me. Now moderately pissed, I go back online; they say that the online and phone orders are on separate computer systems (who the FUCK does that???) and so they still see me as having an open account. They advise me that I explain the situation to the phone reps and they should give me the deal. Call them up, this doesn't happen. After some back-and-forth with the customer service guy, I tell them to just fucking transfer me to sales, I'm sick of their shit. End up paying double per month what I would have if I had gotten the online deal.
*And after all that* on my first bill they overcharged me 150% from the price that I already thought was too high. I don't yell on the phone ever, but after the FOURTH person I talked to on this, my second call to them in a month, I flipped a shit. Thankfully that got me a better deal, although it still wasn't as good as the online advertised rate. 
**FUCK Comcast.**
I was vacationing in Italy about an hour or two from Rome on the coast. My family and I just flew in and were dropped off at our beachside hotel at around 6pm. Naturally we were hungry and tired and since we've never been to Italy we decided that real pizza would be the best option.
We walked along a road for maybe a mile and eventually found a pizza joint that was semi-busy. We walked in and I asked the hostess where we order in passable Italian. She was helpful and pointed us to the server window where we could place our order. I ordered their largest margarita pizza to go, paid, and we all sat down to wait.
We sat and watched while customers walked in, sat down, ordered, and received their food in 10 minutes. We were there for nearly an hour. Pizzaless I approached the window to ask what was going on and they gave me the cold shoulder. When I finally got someones attention, they fucking exploded on me. I reached a decent level in high school Spanish which made learning some Italian for this trip easier, so I could understand a little of what they were saying which basically translated to "idiot tourists".
That really didn't bother me, since as an American in southern California I've grown accustomed to both ~~annoying~~ tourists and people disliking me for no real reason. What did bother me was how they took our money and had us sit their on uncomfortable wooden benches for an hour and then yelled at as when I asked why.
The whole fiasco ended up with us being flagged down by a group of Italian-Americans at the restaurant who let the five of us join them. When we asked if we should give them some money they told us it was alright. They also cussed out the now fuming kitchen staff.
Turns out they were on the cruise we were taking and we ended up having a great time. I still keep in contact with one of the sons.
tl;dr
Italians being major dicks to tourists
I've had plenty of WTF moments. Let's see... ok here's one.
I was going out with my gf to dinner and we decided on a nice Mexican restaurant. We get seated, the waiter is cool, the food was good everything went great. So in the end, I get the bill and I gave him my credit card and I awaited the receipt and to fill in the tip line.
He comes back and says "Sorry, our credit card machine isn't working, do you have cash?" Now I've never paid cash in a restaurant. Call me crazy, I just always pay everything in plastic and I very rarely have cash. Well luckily enough this day I had cash on me. I gave him $50 (the total was $47) and I awaited my change.
This is the truth, I was waiting for him to bring me back my $3 dollars, because I need $2 dollars to use for parking later. And with the remaining one dollar I was going to add it to the five dollar bill in my hand that I was going to leave for him. I guess he didn't buy it, because he never came back. Minutes later I flag him down and he says he won't give me my change back. I didn't want to ruin the night so I said w/e, and I STILL left the $5 dollars on the table and left. In hindsight I would of FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT. If this ever happens to me again I will ask for the manager, get all of my complete change and not leave one penny.
 Waiter thought I was trying to stiff him, I honestly wasn't.
Here's what happened to me: So I'm running low on whey protein and need to get another 2lb tub. I usually go to either Walmart or Target but I wasn't close to either one at the time and had a coupon for Max Muscle. I enter the store and it is completely empty and the single employee in the store is in the back of the store in the storage area. He comes to help me and I ask him if he has any Whey Protein. He scoffs and says condescendingly, "Yeah that is kinda what we specialize in" He then asks me if I was looking for anything in particular and I say that the brand doesn't matter as long as it has 25-30 grams of protein. He asks what my budget is and I tell him 25-30 bucks. He scoffs yet again and says even more condescendingly, "There is nothing in the store for that." and then barely looks around and says "Except maybe for this one pounder here." and just walks away all high and mighty. I just left the store right then and there. No wonder they didn't have any customers. Besides I can get some good whey protein at Walmart or Target for like 18 bucks and thought that maybe there would be better deals at Max Muscle. Pshhhh.
 Go to Max Muscle, guy is a huge condescending asshole, went to Target instead, got some good protein!
I needed my hot tub repaired, so I called a repair &amp; cleaning service in a nearby town.  I live out in the boonies, but the company's website said they offered repair service to all cities in my county.  (the two towns are about a 1/2 hr drive apart.)  The phone representative made an appointment for the following week.  I was planning on taking time off work to drive home to meet him, but got a call an hour BEFORE the appt.  from the phone rep saying the driver had driven around my town and couldn't find my address, his GPS wasn't working, so they were cancelling the visit and taking my town off their service map.  I was annoyed that they had delayed the repair process for me by a week, so I posted a 1-star review on the google page for their business.  I got a voicemail two hours later from the phone rep, politely saying that he felt the review was unfair, that he tried to explain their reasoning for not showing, and asked me to remove the review.  A few minutes later, i got a call from the driver, who was verbally abusive right off the bat:  
driver:"do you have any idea how far &lt;bcmanucd's town&gt; is from XXXX County?"  
Me: "well it's in XXXX County..."  
driver: Do you have any idea how far it is from civilization?"  
Me: "well I drive to civilization every day for work, so not that far"  
driver: "it is when your truck gets 12 miles per gallon"  
this continued for a minute or two, and eventually I offered to change the review to two stars, because I was still disappointed in their service.  driver refused my offer, demanding that I delete the review completely.  I said I was done discussing it, and hung up.  
He rang my phone ~6 more times in rapid succession, and I posted another review saying the guy was currently harassing me over the phone.  
Then, I started getting text messages:  
"what time will you be home tonight?"  
"$268k home, works for &lt;random business name&gt;"  
Driver was making it look like he had information on me, although some of his data was incorrect.  A little while later, I got this call:  
driver:"So I know two of your coworkers and the real estate agent who sold you the house, &lt;name&gt; (not the right realtor)"  
Me: "So you're stalking me now?"  
driver:  "Oh I haven't even begun to stalk you.  This is the last time I'm going to ask you to take down the review."  (hung up)  
The next day, I get another text: "hey numbnuts.  &lt;bcmanucd's town&gt; was never on our service map. You will be sued if you do not remove your review. Final warning"  
I got a phone call from the phone rep, who relayed the same warning from the driver.  I asked him if the driver worked for him.  Turns out the driver was the owner and boss.  I eventually took down the review, not wanting to call the guy's bluff, or worse, having to go to court.  A few days later I noticed a $20 charge on my bank account for a credit report.  Had to call the 3 credit agencies and get the charge reversed and fill out forms for identity theft.  I looked on the BBB website and a few other websites and found that this guy makes a regular habit of running a credit report on anyone he has conflicts with, and often puts a mechanic's lien on houses he's worked at that had any sort of conflict.  
Now I do a thorough Yelp/Google/BBB check on any business before doing business with them.  
  Pool repairman did a terrible job of keeping an appointment he made.  I posted a negative review on Google, and he intimidated me into removing it.
My friends and I went to a show at a House of Blues and ate there beforehand.  The server was fine until around halfway through the meal when he stopped showing up to refill drinks, check on us, etc.  Eventually after a while (it was starting to get near the start time) we ask another server wandering by to ask our waiter to come over.  A while later the manager comes by - nobody can find our waiter.  She assigns a new one who gets us a last round of refills and takes care of the check.  We left never knowing what ever happened to him, and he gave no indication of being pissed/distracted/sick/whatever.
**Next up on Mysteries of the Unknown: The Case of the Mysterious Vanishing Waiter**
I'm not sure if this counts, because I had not summoned their services, but whatever.
It was about 7pm and I was driving on the freeway, my best friend in the passenger seat. I was in the left lane, no traffic (aside from maybe 4-5 other cars within a quarter of a mile), doing about 75 in a 65.  All of a sudden, this van comes speeding up behind me. I didn't want to get over in case he went to pass me on the right, but there were no cars next to me. I sped up to about 85 to get a safe distance away before getting over.  
In the van are two guys and they are tailing me extremely closely and laughing their asses off. So I hurry up and get over.  The guy driving gets to where his passenger window is lined up with mine, flips me off while his friend laughs.  At this point I realize it is a company van for a steam cleaning company.  He slams on his breaks and gets behind me again, speeding back up to my tail. At this point I'm livid and scared. 
I got over again and they were intentionally swerving back and forth as they approached my window again, laughing and flipping me off, wearing company shirts.  My passenger pulled out her phone and took down the company's name, the license plate, and the time.
We pulled over and I called the main office, leaving the VP a professional and calm, but stern, voicemail of the company all the details: what the plate number was, the time and freeway we were on, the approximate distance we had driven being harassed by them, and what the men looked like, as well as my expression of how their company's image has been ruined for me and I would expect this matter be taken care of immediately.
Fuckers better have been fired.  That shit was insane. 
I was almost ran off the road by two assholes in a company van.
My mom was recently diagnosed with cancer. The diagnosis came from some tests done after a hysterectomy she had a few weeks ago. During her three days in the hospital after the procedure however she had some of the worst hospital attendants you could immagine. During these first three days, according to her doctors, she was not allowed to stand on her own, she was always to have attendants to make sure she was ok to walk around, they were also required to be there when she went to the restroom.
On her first night in the hospital, for the first time she has to go to the bathroom so she pushes the button to call for help. A male nurse(or attendant, or someone wearing an employee tag) comes in and asks what she needs. He says he will go find a woman and asks her to hold it a bit. Three episodes of Seinfeld and countless button pushes later she decides she can't hold it in any longer and gets up for the first time since the surgery and goes to the bathroom by herself.
She was yelled at by the attending for leaving her bed and my mother was near tears when we finally went to see her the next morning because of what happened.

The next night, another nurse (attending, assistant, ect.) comes in to change an IV however my mom has the TV on in her room and the woman, early 20's (teaching hospital,) becomes distracted, sits down in the visitors chair and watches for nearly 10 minutes before my mom has to snap her out of it.
The same night she asked to have her sheets changed as the ones she had were from directly after her surgery and IV fluid had leaked onto it and after two days strait in the same sheets the woman wanted something fresher feeling (can you blame her?) After asking twice someone from the linen department finally brings her a new set of sheets however this woman simply places them on the edge of the bed and walks out without a word. My brother, visiting the next morning finally changed the sheets for my mom after he heard what had happened.

**** Avoid Teaching Hospitals
this has happened to me before and the explanation i have gotten is that when you reserve a room you are really only requesting 2 beds, and its not guaranteed.
fuck you
Similar story: When I was 17 I was going on this trip and need to meet the bus 7 in the morning. I had just flown into the city the night before and bused out to my hotel. Reservations were made weeks in advance but when I get there and was told there was no record of it. My mother had organised and so I figured she had fucked up (she hadn't). There was a big game being played that weekend and all rooms were taken, in the whole city. I'm begging with this guy saying just give me closet, a couch anything but no deal; I'm calling every hotel within an hours drive (I figured the limit of my money) but get told to leave. I find a Mc Donald's and stay there for a few hours but it wasn't a 24 hour one so again I have to leave. I figure I walk to where the bus is coming in the morning and it is a really dodge area. I get scared at this point (1-2am) and jump a fence of a small business and sleep between some dumpsters; waking an hour later to the sound of some poor fucker getting the living shit beaten out of him while I hold my breath praying they don't find me. 
I caught the bus in the end and had a great time.
- Found myself in a strange city homeless for a night, hiding while someone gets the shit beaten out of him.
One evening around 10ish, while living in Pittsburgh, we headed to A diner in the south side of the city. In this evening out there were 5 total, including myself, 3 women and 2 guys. All of them cram into booth facing the glass windows looking out on the street. I get the lucky seat at the ~~end~~ head of the table. The wait staff knows how how to handle the college crowd that is a staple in the area at night. However this waitress was very friendly to all of us, most importantly myself (a male) sitting at the head. 
She kept referring us as 'Angel' but manly myself since, *she* put her hands on my shoulders (I am not a touchy-friendly guy) and was very, maybe too friendly to me. We ate had good fun at my expense since I was very closed minded at that time. To put this in context **SHE** was a pre/post-op trans. She was around 6'2" and about 200lbs with nice ~~broad~~ wide shoulders to my 5'6" 140lbs geeky frame.
When she gave us the bill we forgot to mention that we wanted separate checks and just pooled our money together. While waiting for the girls to finish in the bathroom, I go up and cash out at the register. I grab the remaining cash and figure 20+% to be a good amount for all the B.S. that the other people would have put her though the rest of the night. I put the cash down on our table and the girls and my friend have already exited. I leave and walk out to meet them. All of a sudden I hear "HEY GET BACK HERE!" I am about 30 feet from the entrance of the diner and I see this blonde linebacker whipping the door open and come charging after me. She says "Whats this!", I muster a slight whimper of "its your tip" with a clear tremble in my voice. She is a bit taken back and says "well then who did you give your bill to?" I said waitress' name that was behind the counter. She responds "Oh ok ....uh thanks" I am at this point barely keeping my bladder in check and my friends all witness this and then burst out laughing, and for the rest of the night they are  calling me angel.
*** The moon is really out during the day time
A few weeks ago I ordered a washer and dryer from a home improvement store. I had to call the store directly because their website wasn't working even though it's a widely known national chain. Anyway, the guy who answers the phone in appliances immediately says he will have to call me back. Even though I was a little annoyed, I agreed. When he does call me back, he immediately puts me on "hold" because he had too many customers in the store. Wtf?! Why would you call me back then? He proceeds to put me on hold about five more times, but his idea of hold is putting the phone on the counter while he speaks to other people. I can hear their conversations. 
Fast forward a week, they don't have the washer and dryer in stock. I was never told that they wouldn't be in stock for my scheduled delivery. After raising my voice, they upgraded my washer and dryer for no charge. When they deliver that w/d the next day, the delivery guys say it won't fit. So they take it back to the store, mess up the return, but luckily I got it corrected. I go to the store and pick out a w/d that same day of my delivery to be delivered now 4 days later. 
They called me on that delivery date saying they can't find the washer. I'm like I was told this was in stock and it would be no problem to be delivered on time. So they promise me they will deliver it a week later. By the time, that one would have been delivered it would have been a month from my original order. Yes I had too much patience in this. After I hung up from that rescheduling, I was so livid that I called back to speak to a manager. Customer service puts me on hold long enough that my call never goes through to the manager. It keeps going back to customer service. After 4 times of being "redirected," I told them I wanted to cancel my damn order. Luckily that went smoothly. 
Well later that day, I'm walking into a local appliance store and this original store calls me. They tell me they have found my washer and can deliver that evening. The woman attempts to convince me to take this w/d. I'm like "ma'am, I've cancelled my order. I'm walking into a different store to buy a w/d and I will NEVER do business with your store again. Good-bye." I walked in to the new store and purchased the same w/d for less money. 
Lessons learned: 1. Shop local 2. Don't have that much patience with poor customer service. 3. Be honest and upfront with salesman (aka don't take their bullshit)
But this seriously makes me wonder how that store can sell any appliances!
when buying appliances, don't put up with poor customer service. It will take you a month to get a w/d if you do. 
A friend from out-of-town wanted to go out for her birthday.  We made a reservation for our group of 10 people.  There were some minor glitches with dinner, for example, the server forgot to place my wife's order so she had to eat after everyone else had finished. Then the server dropped off the check within 2 minutes of a fresh round of drink orders because she wanted to go home.  She then proceeded to come back to the table another 3 times within 5 minutes until she finally told us we had to pay immediately  because her shift was about to end. 
The end result was that we only left her a tip, which came out to a tad over 13%. Not the worst or best  tip in the world, but what we felt was adequate for the level of service and rush to get us out the door. 
The manager (who also turned out to be the owner) came over and asked us why we short changed the waitress. We explained the situation and why we felt the tip was an adequate gratuity for our rushed and mishandled dinner.  I even offered to put another $10 on my credit card and tried to hand it to him, which he shoved back at me. He then proceeded to clear off our tables and actually picked them up and carried them away! Keep in mind that all of the other tables in the restaurant still had people drinking and eating at them. So as we sat at our now tableless seating area, a few from the group tried to order some shots at the bar. The bartender, however, told them that the manager told her she wasn't allowed to serve them. 
**The owner of a restaurant picked up our table and carried it away while we were still sitting at it.**
My friend won tickets to a comedy show @ The Funny Bone off the radio because they were having a contest if you could "out joke the mexican comedian", his joke that won it was - "What is the last thing Jesus told the Mexicans before he died?","Don't do anything until I get back".  We get there a little early, take a Patron shot with a cute asian girl and her friend and then drink a beer.  Everyone lines up and walks into the venue, us with beers in hand and talking walk right in thinking thats what everyone else is doing too.  We sit down at a table but then see the girls across from us so my friend asks a nearby bouncer if we can move.  He goes off on my friend telling him that we didn't even hand our stub to the door guy and says no we can't move.  My friend asks him again politely apologizing for not knowing we needed to do that.  The bouncer gets in his face, my friend tells him to get his little dick off his knee and then it went downhill from there.  He throws us out before the comedy show even starts causing a huge scene and 200 people staring at us.  Pretty entertaining though and my friend called the radio show the next day and got to tell them what happened on air.
- Went to a comedy show with a friend.  Took a shot of Patron and drank a beer with 2 cute girls, then went into watch the show.  We sit at a random table then want to move to where they're sitting.  Bouncer starts a fight with my friend and gets us kicked out for pretty much no reason.
I have a similar story. I worked at a local convenience store in the Northeast. At the time both my company and the local ATF agency had very strictly stepped up on carding individuals purchasing cigarettes if they looked under 30. A woman came in while a man(I'm guessing her boyfriend) waited in the car. When she came to my register I carded her as she looked quite young. She argued with me over her age for a few minutes until she went outside the store to get the man waiting in the car. He then proceeded to come inside the store and demand I sell the cigarettes to him. I told him that it was company policy and state law that I needed to see her ID as they were together and she had initially asked for the cigarettes. After quite a few minutes of profanity he looks me in the eye and tells me he's going to kill me. This wasn't the first time I had my life threatened at this job and I've been trained enough that I didn't fear him. Then he proceeded to take a knife out of his pocket and lunge at me over the counter. Luckily I moved out of the way fast enough and there happened to be a local cop in the store watching the whole situation. He was arrested immediately and I never saw him again. 
Worked at convenience store, carded girl for cigarettes, boyfriend came in threatened my life then pulled a knife on me and was arrested.
Pretty tame, but:
I was at a Shoney's with my mother and father when I was around 13.  If you're not familiar with it, Shoney's is sort of a shady buffet that also has a menu you can order from.  We were all sat at a table, had our drink orders taken, and then nothing for twenty minutes.  We were all getting buffet trips anyway, so we just went ahead to the buffet.  We ate for like twenty minutes, when another person (not the person who took our order) comes along and asks if we need anything.  My father complained (very loudly and rudely) that our server hadn't done anything in forty minutes except take our drink orders.  The new waitress goes into the back, few minutes later a manager comes out and explains to us that our server quit immediately after taking our order.  We didn't get any kind of compensation or anything, but I didn't really care.  There was also someone walking around in a Winnie the Pooh costume and a baby screaming because of said person.
  Went to Shoney's, waiter quit after taking drink order, and Winnie the Pooh scared the shit out of a baby.
I won't go into details as I'm on mobile, but one time my friends went to Denny's to get some slamwiches. We ended up waiting two hours for our food. And then the pill-head tried to make us pay with a 20 percent discount. Yeah right bro. I got his GM's personal cell phone number and she comped the food and said next time, it was on her as well. I went back 4 months later. Whoops. Kind of went into detail anyway. Haha. 
Denny's employees are pretty dim sometimes.
I worked at a movie place and at the end of the night we had to clear the credit/debit card machine. This would make the machine print out everyone's information who paid with a credit card that day. My boss instructed me to just throw it out in the garbage under the register. I asked her if we should shred them, and she said no it will cut into company hours to walk to the back of the store and go in the manager's room to use the shredder. I always took the extra five minutes every night when closing just to do this because I thought it was insanely stupid and could get me or the business in trouble if anyone ever decided to go through our trash bags.
boss told me to throw paper with credit card numbers away, I disobeyed and took extra time on the clock to properly shred them.
So this happened years ago to my family and I when we went to see Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. My dad went to go pay for the tickets. Upon hearing that he wanted tickets for Austin Powers the young man at the ticket counter started looking nervously at my sister and I. I was probably 13 at the time and she was 11. He quickly motioned to my dad to come close and grabbed a card board sign so we couldn't see what he was saying. He got really close to my dad and whispered, "The space ship is shaped like a penis...".
TL/DR: A man tried to stop my family and I from seeing Austin Powers because he was worried about the phallic shaped space ship. 
I thought about this scenario, and I speculate thusly:
Let's say the manager generally has faith in the employee.  However manager is presented with Father and Son.
Tact-fu Coco suggests pawning off the Father and Son with cash back.  Since, really no big deal.  Also consider:  Movie pass.  Since PR.
At this point, manager would check in with Employee and present the scenario with the F&amp;S.  There are different avenues here - but one example is the manager could 'play off' giving F&amp;S cash back and a pass since PR.  The manager could stress/reiterate the importance of diplomacy in difficult situations and sometimes being 'right' isn't as important as not burning bridges.  
I'm having difficulty fathoming that being called an asshole is worth kicking a person out of line.  Let's say a person did call an usher an asshole.  I *guarantee* it's happened.  (Proof:  I've worked as an usher).  It's pretty poor to escalate so much over something as paltry as 'asshole'.
Tact-fu manager may decide it's worthwhile coaching the usher that it's wise to have a thick skin and perhaps offer some helpful language techniques.  E.g. In the case of an 'assholing'... 
* L1, 'single asshole call' = "Excuse me sir?"  "Sir, I don't think that language is appropriate.", "Sir, I hope you appreciate it's very busy.  We'll all be taking our seats soon".  (If the person didn't say asshole, it's a chance for the person to clarify.  If a person did say asshole, and if they want to, let them apologize/explain and receive it gracefully.  Give the person an out for them to save some face, it's worthwhile. And if a person did say asshole, and *denies* it, I don't care if it stops right there. I just want less asshole)
* L2 'multiple calls of asshole' = "Sir.  That language is inappropriate.  Please use language that's more respectful of everybody in line." "If you continue with such language you will forfeit your ticket"  ""If you continue with such language you will forfeit your ticket and we *will* call the police for disturbing the peace"  (Again, I still say give the cash back, that's just good hedging PR)
* L3 'serious business calls of asshole' = "Your continued use of language is inappropriate.  Please step out of the line."  "Step out of the line and respect the other movie patrons." "I'm calling the police."  (L3 will be made much easier with multiple ushers, perhaps 2ish.  Not that close though; it's not meant to be a physical intimidation tactic, it's more of a solidarity show.  The manager would also fit right in here.  Actually, the manager should probably be doing the L3.)
I've never been anywhere close to L3,  I'm guessing some.  I expect upmarket bouncers could probably chime in.  I expect it's a tough spot to be.  
  Manager got sacked since lack of tact.  Just give the cash back.  There ain't downside in that.


  
I had just turned 21 and was home in a rural area, visiting my folks (birthday is around the holidays).  My mom thought it would be great for me to go buy us vodka for the house, since I could legally do it, while we were out shopping.  
She's waiting in the car with my grandmother, while my sister (6 years younger) comes into the state-run liquor store with me.  Derp around, get the vodka, go to check out, get carded.
I'm fine.  The cashier motions to my sister, and my 21 year old brain didn't even think this would be a problem.  She was 15 and didn't have any type of ID, as she couldn't even drive yet.  I tried to explain this to the cashier when my mom comes into the store, trying to see what was taking so long.   
Cashier explains the situation, things get heated when she won't allow MY MOM to buy the vodka.  My mom starts yelling (don't get between her and the vodka), threatening to go get my grandmother out of the car to buy it.  Security is called.  We are escorted out, banned for 24 hours.  Yay 21!
3 generations banned from buying liquor for a day
I fucking work in a place all about customer service. Let me tell you Americans are a fucking whiny, bitchy, entitled bunch of pricks when it comes to dining.
Since I feel as if the topic still applies to customer service, if you are servicing someone and it is a Wtf moment for you, I will post my story.
The place I work at has a kids night every Tuesday. Plain and simple, kids get a free meal off the kids menu that night. No annoying bullshit or anything. 
Fast forward to the worst night of working in my life. Three people has just quit in under a week because the job is a nightmare(I can explain that later if needed) and we did not have anyone willing to come in to cover for the night. So it was myself, and two others working the dining room which usually takes a solid team of five if not more on kids night. Then we had about four people in the back, and usually kids night is about six. 
So the night was literally hell. People were complaining left and right about small little pieces of shit. 
"I asked for mayo on the side of my sandwhich, so I could put it on how I liked it!"
"My soup is too cold!" Mind you this is while I could see the soup fucking steaming in front of my face.
"I asked for low ice on my sweet tea!"
"My son wanted the Mac and Cheese, not the grilled cheese!" When I took the order earlier she said grilled cheese.
I understand that some of those things can be easily disputed, or should not have happened in the first place. But after about three hours  of things like that the shit gets old fast. 
It wasn't really bad until the worst family walked in. This whole family was easily morbidly obese. They lumber up slowly to the register, and then complain about having to wait in a line. (Mind you I could not do a fucking thing about this) They proceed to demand free cookies for their inconvenience. At this point I did not care, I just gave them some cookies because I was tired of the shit. Finally after them calming down about the line, they proceeded to order. This order was easily fifteen plates worth of food, for a family of six. So the whole process took a while, and just to make sure I had it right I read the entire thing back to the family. As I was doing this, the lady I assumed was the mother interrupted me saying something along the lines of: "Boy, don't be stupid just get us our food." Then the entire family began trotting away before I had finished reading the order back.
About six or so minutes later I was bringing the food out to the same family. As I got there they again begin to complain that they waited too long, and begin demanding free desserts, (Ie. cheesecake, carrot cake, etc.) I told them they would have to talk to the manager, as per our policy on this. They instantly stopped demanding the dessert and began to shun me as I asked if I could get them anything else before I left them to their feeding trough. With no answer I said enjoy your meal and I walked away. 
About two minutes later the 'littlest' girl from the table comes up with a pissed off look on her face. I say littlest because she looked like Violet Beauregarde from fucking Willy Wonka after she turned into a giant blueberry, just minus the color. 
She comes up all angry that there was honey mustard on her sandwhich. The sandwhich comes with honey mustard, it says it plainly on the menu. After explaining this, she gets even more pissed saying I did not tell her about it. Then claiming she did not know and wanted her money back. I told her I would get the manager and talk about it. This time she did not back down, and I sent the manager out. 
They did not get their money back, and needless to say that pissed them off much more.
Before the entire herd of a family left they asked for refills. The little boy, about six or seven handed me the glasses and talked to me like I was a three year old child. He said: "This one is sweet tea, this one is unsweet tea, do you understand? Or do I need to say it again?"
I almost lost my job in that moment, honestly I wanted to just sock the little fucker in the face.
After holding back my rage and filling their drinks, I brought the drinks back to the table, and the little shit asked: "Did you get them right? Because I wasn't sure I explained it so you could understand me."
I told him something along the lines of sure did, and walked away.
Obviously they did not leave a tip.

 **FUCK FAT PEOPLE AND THEIR FUCKING FAT CHILDREN!** Also, be nice to your damn waiters, it goes a long way and they go through hell for you. If they deserve it, and they honestly have not attempted to be nice to you, then you can be a dick. But if the fucking waiter/waitress is decent, or subpar. Don't be a douche, you don't know what they have had to deal with, or what the fuck they are going though. Try to be a fucking human being and you may get good service!
This just happened today
Went to the safeway to return some bad milk. It wasn't spoiled, just didn't taste right.
ME: Hi I'd like to return this it doesn't taste right.
CS: OK, em well we don't return perishable items. 
ME: I have a receipt and you can try it yourself if you don't believe me.
CS: Oh, I believe you but we just don't return this stuff. It's our store policy.
ME: Where is that written down? Can I see it?
CS: It's in a binder somewhere, I'd have to look through 12 binders to find it.
ME: OK then, I have time.
Then she leaves and calls her supervisor on the phone. I can hear parts of the conversation like, "I don't think he'll just leave...." and "No I can't find it" The whole time I think I'm getting the hassle. Finally the manager arrives behind the counter and the whole thing starts over again
MGR: Hi, well um we just can't take this back and give you cash. It's not our policy.
ME: Fine, a gift card then or coupon?
MGR: No, I have to give you the exact item back
ME: (furrious) Look woman, I'm going on this errand for my girlfriend I have another ten things to do after this so that milk will be sitting in a hot trunk for about 4 hours. I'll have to take that one back too. Got it? Just give me a refund!
MGR: I can't do that, its against store rules. I can only exchang---
ME: NO! I'm NOT leaving until I get a REFUND, OR or some kind of in store credit. GOT IT? if I come back home with the same milk I'm gonna get my ass chewed. Then she is going to come back here and yell at you'all and probably throw the milk at you. It's been sitting out for hours now. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLEAN THAT UP?
MGR (scared look) Yeh, uhhh no sir. Lets get this taken care of right now. 

She then fumbled around with the register and finally handed me a whopping 3.69 back in cash. 
ME: Was that so hard?
MGR: Sorry, have a good day sir.
ME: WHAT'S LEFT OF IT!
I attracted a small crowd and an older gentlemen nodded at me on my way out. I mean really, have things gotten so bad that the store won't cough up a measly 4 bucks because of a bad product? 

TLDR safeway sucks and their customer service is going to hell. Customer is now pissed off, shares with all on reddit.
I volunteered to help an idiot drunk use a calling card at my local dive bar. The guy accused me of trying to memorize the 16 digit code. I bought him a Lone Star to settle him down and it had the opposite effect. He followed me into the bathroom and wanted to fight. I asked if he wouldn't  mind until I put my dick back in my pants. He agreed, and before I could finish pissing my buddy charged and and promptly kicked the shit out of the guy.
an attempted act of kindness ended up with a a drunk bloody on the floor of a very dirty bathroom floor.
I am probably too late. 
Last year a group of us went to Pensacola, FL for a vacation. We went to a well known Pizza place and ordered 3 Large Pizza to go. The cashier told us they were out of the large Pizza boxes so we could either eat it here or order medium or smaller. We were a little shocked by that answer. So we told her we would gladly take the large pizzas in 2 medium boxes.
She went back to check with the owner and we expected it to be a non issue, She came back and told us that the owner told her that she could give us only one large and that is it. This really surprised us and we asked to speak to the owner. 
A really mad owner then came out and started yelling at us for being difficult and then said he was not interested in serving people of our kind. I'm not sure what he was referring to by people of our kind other than our race. He told us he needed us to leave the property right away and he was not going to serve anything to us. 
We later on talked to a cop and they told us we legally couldn't do anything the owner and it was his right not to serve us.
The owner was an asshole.
Not nearly as bad as yours, but here goes: my friend and I were going to go to a concert. At the time, we were 18, and we checked the event page on Facebook to confirm that the event wasn't 19+ (we're Canadian.) It wasn't. So we went to the box office to get the tickets, but the girl there told us that we couldn't buy tickets because we were underage. We were kind of bummed out, but I messaged a coordinator of the event and she told us that the show was, in fact, for all ages. So we went back to the box office to see if someone with more sense was working. Turns out that by then the show had sold out.
 Friend and I missed a concert because the person selling the tickets mistakenly told us that the show was 19+ when it wasn't. 
More  than likely going to get buried but wth.
A few months i  was between jobs, and not doing so great. Some friends and i decide to go grab a drink at a local bar, and end up getting pizza next door. Again, i was rather poor at the moment and had been living off pizza for days. A friend offers to get me a delicious burger at the bar we had been  at. He handed me his card and i ordered the burger. I will admit i probably should of asked if i should tip, but felt uncomfortable about it so decided to leave "0 sorry =( " instead
He delivered the food, i ate it, then commented on how it was the best burger i had ever had (probably because it was the only thing i had eaten that day) and he made a snarky comment about being sure to tell the chef. 
My friends left, and went inside to read and finish my drink (which i tipped for) just in time to hear this guy call me a bitch while telling the story to a random customer, and went on griping about it for 20 minutes before realizing i was sitting 10 feet away.
Still wont go back there, even if their food is amazing.
didnt tip,bartender called me a bitch and continued to bitch about it for 20  minutes before realizing i could hear everything he was saying.
Sorry, this is kinda long, but there's a lot of info to include.
New place had opened in town. Bar and grill, bowling, laser tag, arcade, karaoke, etc. One of those entertainment venues. I used to go to karaoke places with a group of friends and some of their family members pretty regularly, so we decided to check it out. First night we're there, there's a fair number of us, like 10 of us. Being a former dishwasher/buser, I understand a top of 10 can be a pain, but whatever. Waitress comes over to take our orders. 
Now, to put this into visual context, the place is split up into multiple rooms. Bar and grill/karaoke in one room, bowling's in the next room, and so on, everything's section off. Also, the waitstaff has to cover all of these rooms, too. Coming into the place, there's barely any cars in the parking lot, and in the bar, besides the group I'm with, there's maybe 5 or 6 extra people. From our vantage point, we can see into the bowling alley, and there's hardly anybody there, maybe another 10 people, if that. Besides the bartender, there's probably a good 7-8 waitresses/waiters running around.
Back to the ordering. Waitress comes over to take our orders. She comes to one corner of the table (long style table) and takes orders. She stays at that corner. A table of 10, and she stays at one corner for the orders. She doesn't try to speak up to the people in our group who are farther out (myself included). After struggling to get her our orders, she leaves. After several minutes, she brings us our drinks. That's the last of her we see for half an hour.
During that time, it's not really an issue. Half an hour's a long time, but we're talking and singing and having fun. Finally the waitress comes back around. She stops at the same corner, barely manages a "Everybody here doing okay? Okay." then walks off. Several of us wanted refills, some wanted food, but she barely stops, doesn't really make an effort to take any orders, then leaves again. This time she's gone probably another 20 minutes or so.
After this time, a couple people in the group go up to the bar to get drinks, because hey, why wait for another prolonged period of time to maybe not get waited on? They get to the bar and get drinks, then the bartender informs them they need to place their drink orders with our waitress (it was something about screwing up tabs, if I recall). So they came back. Right after that, the waitress comes back in a huff. "Oh, so you guys want to order something?" The rest of the night, she has this attitude, and still barely checks in on us. End of the night rolls around, and we barely leave a tip. The waitress barely did her job, most of us felt she didn't deserve a good tip.
A couple days later, a family member of one of the people in the group passes along a message from the karaoke DJ. The owner was aware that the DJ knew our group, and our waitress complained to the owner about her 'lousy tip'. The owner then told the DJ to inform us that if we don't intend to tip, that they don't want us returning. We decided to return the following week to see if that night was a fluke, plus we liked the DJ and didn't want him catching any flack because of us.
The following week's a little busier, but not by much, and we don't have as big of a group. So we come in, and we have a different waitress, so it seems like everything's going smoothly. Nope. Practically the same treatment. Come to find out later, our original waitress told the rest of the wait staff about our 'behavior', that they're all giving us the cold shoulder treatment now. Needless to say, the waitress that night didn't get much better of a tip. She did a better job, but barely.
We didn't go there regularly again, but we'd still drop in every so often (whether it was karaoke, food, bowling, or whatever) and the service still sucked. Like, in every department. I witnessed a guy in the laser arcade get pissed off for having to wait because a kid got a bloody nose. Ridiculous. 
Place closed down a few years ago for failing to pay back loans to get the place open in the first place. Turns out the owner was pocketing everything or something. Go fig.
 Went for karaoke with large group, got poor service, waitress complained about tip. Went back next week, still got poor service.
