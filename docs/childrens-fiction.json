  "'\nThen the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind, and she said it was rather a short engagement, but she supposed young people understood their own affairs best.",
  "At last, stretched at full length in a sunny place, the prince found a very old, half-blind, miserable cat.",
  "it is thou, then, who art eating up our hay this time, thought the boy; but I will put a stop to that.",
  "In places the air was darkened by showers of lobster-patties, white puddings, sausages, tarts, and all sorts of sweetmeats, or with pieces of gold and silver, diamonds and pearls.",
  "He could not see it, of course, but he felt it with his hands.",
  "The poor creature was lean, and its fur had fallen off in patches; it could no longer catch birds, nor even mice, and there was nobody to give it milk.",
  "They broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.",
  "His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses; and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty, that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter!",
  "When he went to her room they would hardly let him in, it was so early, but he said that the King had sent for Miranda, and she got up quickly and came out; a little black girl called Patypata held up her train, and her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her.",
  "You have killed the holy woman!",
  "One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend.",
  "'\nWell, you have this time, and let it be a lesson to you; not that there is much comfort in that, for it is not likely you will ever have such another chance -- exactly the idea that had occurred to Benson.",
  "Then the lady said that to kill the dreadful woman with the golden wings and the brass claws, and to cut off her head, he needed three things: first, a Cap of Darkness, which would make him invisible when he wore it; next, a Sword of Sharpness, which would cleave iron at one blow; and last, the Shoes of Swiftness, with which he might fly in the air.",
  "It's probably an art quite beyond me.",
  "I would not mind it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword, as he did that first brace, in fair fight.",
  "And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to admit of: Is it you, my Prince?",
  "said the King, I set great store by that marvelous ring; nevertheless, you shall have it.",
  "In vain he begged and prayed them to let him in; though his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the guards of the palace, and at last, quite broken-hearted, he fell dead at their feet.",
  "Just now, however, I must go and look for my pinks, which I love better than anything in the world.",
  "The marriage festivities are already begun, so you shall marry my daughter this very day.",
  "The upholsterer undid his parcel, and there was a Persian rug, which no one could tell from the magical carpet.",
  "Now you shall kill him, and boil him in the great big cauldron you know of, and when you have got the broth ready give me a call, said the giant; then he lay down on the bench to sleep, and almost immediately began to snore so that it sounded like thunder among the hills.",
  "One was to Herr Schnipp, tailor to the king and royal family; another was to the royal swordmaker, another to the bootmaker, another to the optician, another to the tradesman who supplied the august family with carpets and rugs, another to his Majesty's hatter.",
  "Aladdin now begged to know what he had done.",
  "Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life.",
  "The Princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother how, during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house, and what had passed there.",
  "Besides, I can't stand the notion.",
  "The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot.",
  "And their shouts reached the Princess's ear, but she dared not ask what was happening, for fear she should hear that Charming had been killed.",
  "screamed the little man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two.",
  "She heard exclamations of admiration on all sides; and the King her father looked at her so attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her; but he was so sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him.",
  "Wait here the least little bit of time, while I go home for the seven horses which stand in my father's stable, said he; it is not far off, and I shall not be long away, but I will not let my betrothed bride go on foot to the palace.",
  "Fifteen hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and a half high, were then employed to draw me toward the capital.",
  "Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire.",
  "And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.",
  "But Trusty John held him back, and said: I promised your father before his death that you should n't see what that room contains.",
  "It can't be bought either for gold or money, answered the girl.",
  "Why, Patypata, cried the Princess, kissing her, that would never do; your life is as precious to me as my own, especially after such a proof of your affection as you have just given me.",
  "my little monkey, cried the Princess, I have lost you, and yet I am no better off than I was before.",
  "What was he to do, indeed?",
  "Everybody was delighted to see her; she was so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess, and the Princes who were there could not take their eyes off her.",
  "The next morning Prince Ahmed went out, as usual, at the iron gate, with the same attendants as before, and passed by the magician, whom he knew not to be such, and, seeing her lie with her head against the rock, and complaining as if she were in great pain, he pitied her, turned his horse about, went to her, and asked her what was the matter with her, and what he could do to ease her.",
  "And proud of the title: not enough of fighting.",
  "However, I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him.",
  "I am so angry with the Yellow Dwarf and the Fairy of the Desert that I am not likely to wish to help them, especially since I constantly see your poor Princess, whose beauty and goodness make me pity her so much; and I tell you that if you will have confidence in me I will help you to escape.",
  "One more effort, and he wo n't be able to move!",
  "Charming had pity upon her, and, though he could n't help thinking that she would have been very nice for dinner, he picked her up gently and put her back into the water.",
  "One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the son of Mustapha the tailor.",
  "You must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the tapestry.",
  "And all the time he never once said, Have you read this?",
  "You must have noticed it, Jaqueline; you sat up later.",
  "The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven.",
  "At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley.",
  "I think I must have ridden friskier horses before now.",
  "At this Cinderella, smiling, replied: She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been!",
  "Then number one began again and cried: That'll not help him!",
  "for she had told him this part of the adventure.",
  "Look here, it's rather a long letter; you might read it to us, Jack!",
  "The old count was affected to tears, and withdrew, while King Prigio said: I have not lost a day; I have made an amiable but very stupid man happy.",
  "She seated herself on his back with her bundle, and thus they departed.",
  "said he, and brought out the mill, and made it grind first one thing and then another.",
  "she said, I am the innocent cause of our sorrows, and told him of the exchange of the lamp.",
  "said she, you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go thither.",
  "I accept the alternative, he said, if your majesty will grant me my conditions.",
  "When the King came in the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he straightway made her his wife, and the miller's daughter became a queen.",
  "Round the world he goes, rescuing ladies from every kind of horror -- from dragons, giants, cannibals, magicians; and then, when a girl naturally expects to be married to him, as is usual, off he rides!",
  "mercy, cried the mother; what is it I see?",
  "This made the Princess very happy, and the Queen, who could not bear to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess, touched her with her wand, saying: I wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty.",
  "The giant did n't know what to say, for he could n't have believed it of the little fellow.",
  "The Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said.",
  "As soon as the caravan was ready to set out, the Prince joined them, and arrived happily without any accident or trouble, otherwise than the length of the journey and fatigue of traveling, at the place of rendezvous, where he found Prince Houssain, and both waited for Prince Ahmed.",
  "The old man drew near him in order to watch closely, and his white beard hung right down.",
  "But if Benson was irritated, and suffered from the remarks of his fellow-servants, I do not think we can envy Prince Prigio.",
  "She carried him down, and then hurried with loud protestations to the youth's father.",
  "They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony.",
  "My cousin, take courage; your sorrows are ended.",
  "But the King said: Be quiet, I wish to hear what he says.",
  "Prince Darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass, she was so hungry.",
  "Must I also be made to know that the King of the Gold Mines ceased to love me as soon as he lost sight of me?",
  "Stop there and say: ` From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden, ' and ye both will be restored to your own forms.",
  "On the table was a purse with just three gold coins -- old ones, too -- in it; and this, as you may fancy, the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket.",
  "Then he took it off, and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune, and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree, for it is their business to guard it till the new times come, or till the world's ending.",
  "Then the old troll-hag flew into such a rage that she burst, and the Princess with the long nose and all the little trolls must have burst too, for they have never been heard of since.",
  "This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds.",
  "Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night: Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house, and when that's done it's all up with us.",
  "He got up early in the morning, and went to the river-side, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home.",
  "A thousand misfortunes, Sir Sheep, she answered.",
  "for Dick's hand was bleeding a good deal.",
  "It was large, and divided into several streets, all vaulted and shaded from the sun, and yet very light too.",
  "Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon.",
  "Well, said he, I have wandered about a great deal in my time, and in all kinds of places, but I have never blown so far as that.",
  "Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him.",
  "The poor boy is right, said the Fairy; I was forgetting.",
  "Here he was, restored to his position indeed, but by no means to the royal favour.",
  "He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne, and all the people crowded round, wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor.",
  "Now, this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of and intends to do, for the moon sees and knows everything.",
  "Bellissima was already fifteen years old, and every one of the Princes wished to marry her, but not one dared to say so.",
  "Not so quickly, answered the youth.",
  "I 'm sure she is like a daughter to me.",
  "After two years, when they were all beginning to get used to their new life, something happened to disturb their tranquillity.",
  "And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him with their fiery eyes.",
  "'' On the other hand, he determined to look at the Firedrake; for, of course, he had no delicacy about spying on him, the brute.",
  "'\nThe King's physicians will say, This is an impostor, and not a learned man, ' and they will make all sorts of difficulties, but you will overcome them all at last, and will present yourself before the sick King.",
  "I wish I was at the king's court, and butler.",
  "But he reminded them that he had promised to go back.",
  "cried Dick, angrily; and poor Jaqueline, remembering how she had helped him, at the risk of her own life, when King James nearly crushed her in the shape of a mosquito, turned her head away, and cried silently.",
  "And young people will be young people.",
  "Thirdly: By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal subjects in that city, and to blow up a party against our crown and our peace.",
  "Prince Charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long riding-boots, girt with a broadsword, which was not then generally worn, and carrying a Persian rug under his arm.",
  "But we must not despair; it seems to me, after what you have told me, that something must be going to happen soon.",
  "So, without saying a word, she fetched it and stood it upon the Queen's shelf.",
  "Some fell down dead as they came out before they had time to get away; others crawled farther with great difficulty; while others again lay on the ground, fainting with hunger, and begged a morsel of bread from those who were going into the house, but they would not so much as look at the poor creatures.",
  "The Sultan embraced him, the envious Vizier meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment.",
  "He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do.",
  "Why, said the King, your wise answers astonish me, and you, Miranda.",
  "What can kill such a monster?",
  "The country people whom I met called it Ethiopia.",
  "I am his most faithful subject, and have done nothing against him.",
  "Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle.",
  "And now he's made her another bow, and he's actually taking leave of her.",
  "But first, don't take it amiss that I give you some advice how you shall behave yourself where you are going.",
  "She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully.",
  "But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment.",
  "When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.",
  "It is always the eldest son who goes out first, and comes to grief on these occasions, and it is always the third son that succeeds.",
  "But I shall not always be here, and when I die -- Don't talk of dying, sire, said Dick.",
  "If that's all I have to do, answered the youth, it's easily done; but if I learn to shudder so quickly, then you shall have my fifty dollars.",
  "Had I used my own sword, and he explained its properties, the Prince of Wales would not be alive to tell his story.",
  "So at last the Master-maid had to yield, for he was so absolutely determined to do it.",
  "Oh, sir, you honour us too highly, murmured Lady Rosalind; and the prince blushed and said: Not at all!",
  "Sometimes he was in front of the door, and sometimes the door was in front of him, and it went from one side of the porch to the other, till the attorney was well-nigh beaten to death.",
  "Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over, and my enemy's last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats.",
  "Why, said his Majesty, taking the silver cross out of his pocket, did you not give this to Rosina?",
  "People of that sort praise us to our faces without shame, and hide our faults or change them into virtues.",
  "The queen took her place at the edge of the carpet; I sat between her and the butler, and she said, ' I wish I were in Gluckstein!",
  "I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation.",
  "When the brother saw that, he insisted on having the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it till the haymaking was over, for he thought: If I keep it as long as that, I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year.",
  "It had no form or shape, or none that she could make out; but it pulsed with a heart.",
  "I smell fresh meat, I tell thee once more, replied the Ogre, looking crossly at his wife; and there is something here which I do not understand.",
  "Indeed, as she spoke she fell down insensible, and when she recovered she found herself in her own little bed at home; how she got there she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair, which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it off.",
  "I want to know what you were doing at the fountain so late?",
  "What strange ship is this, he cried, that has a golden hull, silver masts, and silken sails, and who are the young men like princes who man it?",
  "Why, they say the earth goes round the sun, whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on.",
  "But what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace!",
  "At this very moment there was a whizz in the air; something shot past them, and, through the open window, the king, the queen, Benson, and the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador's drawing room!",
  "said Molinda, feeling: quite a respect for him.",
  "Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty.",
  "Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and was just sixteen years old, and the King was beginning to think it was time that she should be married.",
  "There it lay, a handsome green one with a red feather.",
  "I stored the boat with meat and drink, and took six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own country; and to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn.",
  "So much so that those who saw him exclaimed: What a burden he'll be to his father!",
  "You promised to love me always; tell me that you really mean what you said, or I shall have to ask the Fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so much.",
  "I wish you to marry one of them, and you do not try to please me.",
  "Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?",
  "So the two went into the gardens together, and talked about a number of things; but at last the prince told her that, before three days were over, all would be well, or all would be over with him.",
  "Overjoyed to have found her, Prince Darling perched upon her shoulder, trying to express by his caresses how glad he was to see her again, and Celia, surprised and delighted by the tameness of this pretty white dove, stroked it softly, and said, though she never thought of its understanding her: I accept the gift that you make me of yourself, and I will love you always.",
  "Here I have sat waiting hour after hour, and have not even two sticks to lay across each other under the Christmas porridge-pot.",
  "He said that he had found something much rarer -- a white cat!",
  "Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?",
  "Instead of Sesame, he said: Open, Barley!",
  "At last, stretched at full length in a sunny place, the prince found a very old, half-blind, miserable cat.",
  "Francalanza says I 'm improving uncommon.",
  "He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety.",
  "For my part I never will be taken in by them.",
  "Another thing Prince Houssain particularly admired was the great number of rose-sellers who crowded the streets; for the Indians are so great lovers of that flower that no one will stir without a nosegay in his hand or a garland on his head; and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops, that the air is perfectly perfumed.",
  "And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him.",
  "They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.",
  "It is a disgraceful conspiracy, he said.",
  "It was the pretty lady of the carriage.",
  "Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found every one rejoicing, and asked what was going on.",
  "Yes, I did see it, she admitted, blushing.",
  "After seeking me everywhere he believed that I must have been drowned, or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest.",
  "And so the fairies were not invited!",
  "He said he would bear this in mind, and then he again sat in there the whole day by the Master-maid, and they chatted and talked of one thing and another, but the first thing and the last now was, how happy and delightful it would be if they could but marry each other, and get safely away from the giant; and the Prince would have forgotten both the mountain-side and the horse if the Master-maid had not reminded him of them as evening drew near, and said that now it would be better if he went to fetch the horse before the giant came.",
  "The king's mind was so much confused by this time, that he determined to leave it to the Lady Molinda herself.",
  "The princess followed him and took her seat at the writing table.",
  "And you have won it, lovely Princess, interrupted the Prince.",
  "He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in.",
  "But she was really far prettier and cleverer than they were; indeed, she was so lovely that she was always called Beauty.",
  "When he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers: You wait here, I'll manage the giants by myself; and he went on into the wood, casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him.",
  "But her happy dreams of the handsome young Prince soon made her forget the poor Beast, and the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust appearances, to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many other equally perplexing things, which, consider as she would, she could not understand.",
  "While the two women executed the Fairy's commands, she went up to Prince Ahmed, and, whispering in his ear, said: Prince, this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be; and I am very much mistaken if she is not an impostor, who will be the cause of a great trouble to you.",
  "you 're for a fight, are you?",
  "King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir, the hope of Pantouflia.",
  "As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled, and then fell still again; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room, and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water.",
  "He pulled it off in a hurry, and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap, and understood all about the affair.",
  "Then you may hold the shovel, and the shovel you, and pour red-hot coals over you, till day dawns, said the Master-maid.",
  "Now it is all being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster.",
  "Forgive my ignorance, he asked, what is this palace you speak Of?",
  "The Prince was very angry at this speech, and commanded his officers to make Celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace.",
  "I shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons.",
  "Perhaps no girl was ever more strangely beset by misfortune!",
  "The young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure; and, pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it.",
  "At last, not knowing what else to do, she resolved to consult a certain witch who was called The Fairy of the Desert.",
  "He had never been at such a pleasant dinner!",
  "Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage.",
  "The king was anxious to consult the fairies, but the queen would not hear of such a thing.",
  "It is a good distance, said Dick; but a mere step when you wear Seven - league Boots like mine.",
  "These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker's house.",
  "At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules.",
  "Thus he was destroyed by his own cowardice and by chance, and thus the prophecy was fulfilled.",
  "As she grew older she learned to know better; but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic, and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries.",
  "lovely Nymphs, from ocean caves, Who know how sweet true love may be, Come up and calm the furious waves And set a desperate lover free!",
  "But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them, whereupon there was a great shout, and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which pricked me like so many needles.",
  "The slave said it was the holy woman, curing people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the Princess, who had long desired to see Fatima, sent for her.",
  "` Why, Ragotte, ' I said, for that was the fairy's name, ` what is the meaning of all this?",
  "This was more than the prince could be expected to believe.",
  "And the fairies gave him these, and a wallet, and a shield, and belted the sword, which had a diamond blade, round his waist, and the cap they set on his head, and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies.",
  "Six of the crew, of whom I was one, letting down the boat, got clear of the ship, and we rowed about three leagues, till we could work no longer.",
  "But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: I don't know how I 'm to do it; how do I get in?",
  "He left the window wide open, smoked his cigar, and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son.",
  "The Giant folded his legs up neatly, like a pair of trousers, and laid them down on a rock.",
  "The Queen was in a great state, and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if he would only leave her the child.",
  "It is quite true, sire, replied Charming; I should have drawn such a picture of you, and represented your good qualities in such a way, that I am certain the Princess would have found you irresistible.",
  "The Adventure of the Shopkeepers.",
  "When they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet, the Princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards; it was hewn out of one splendid crystal, and had silken curtains, which she drew round her that she might not be seen.",
  "Presently a splendid banquet was served, and the King and his daughters sat down to it, and as he always thought that there was some special meaning in everything, he said to the eldest: Tell me why you have chosen a green dress.",
  "said the old woman as one thing after another appeared; and she wanted to know where her husband had got the mill from, but he would not tell her that.",
  "Looking at strangers out of the window!",
  "The moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees.",
  "When he got there he had a fancy to try if what she had said were true, so he began to work in the same way that he had seen the stable-boys doing in his father's stables, but he soon saw that he must give up that, for when he had worked a very short time he had scarcely any room left to stand.",
  "This man, mounted on a kind of altar of red stone, waved his hand and yelled, and seemed to point to the shadow of the column which fell across the square.",
  "King Gems is old, and likes a quiat life; but I am determined to make an effort, if I go alone, and Europe shall here of Prince Charles.",
  "A hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling interrupted the king.",
  "Then the white folds began to slide, like melting ice, from the black hill.",
  "The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a huge roast turkey had just been placed.",
  "That was the way he used to go on: but now he only talked to the young lady about herself; and she quite left off being shy or frightened, and asked him all about his own country, and about the Firedrake shooting, and said how fond she was of hunting herself.",
  "In his right waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the size of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures, which we humbly conceive to be writings.",
  "Meanwhile, the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat; but there was no use in talking to the queen.",
  "The Sultan took upon himself the care of his daughter's education, and brought her up in his palace with the three Princes, proposing to marry her when she arrived at a proper age, and to contract an alliance with some neighboring prince by that means.",
  "Only a little of the Stupidity reaches the earth, and that only in invisible dust; yet you know how weighty it is, even in that form.",
  "Then turning to Beauty, he said: Take your father into the next room, and help him to choose everything you think your brothers and sisters would like to have.",
  "what plucky fellows they were!",
  "In this sacred city, blessed by the presence of his Holiness the Pope, and the relics of so many martyrs and saints, magic may well cease to be potent, said the Duke of York.",
  "Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out.",
  "If the Stupidity is kept in stock, up in the moon, and comes from there, falling naturally down on the earth in small quantities, I might obtain enough for my purpose, thought King Prigio.",
  "Well, well, I will soon find a cure for that; I have only to call my river-sucker, said the giant, and he did call him.",
  "Celia has loved you ever since she first saw you, only she would not tell you while you were so obstinate and naughty.",
  "The Prince was brought up with great care; and, as soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses.",
  "The treasurer went immediately with it out of the palace, and carried it a great way off; and when she had set it up one end reached to the very palace; at which time the Prince, thinking it small, found it large enough to shelter two greater armies than that of the Sultan his father 's, and then said to Paribanou: I ask my Princess a thousand pardons for my incredulity; after what I have seen I believe there is nothing impossible to you.",
  "They must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to a sea-monster, like what's - her-name.",
  "All's fair in love and war.",
  "it is n't that I care much to have that honor, cried the Dwarf angrily; but here are the lions coming; they'll eat you up in three mouthfuls, and there will be an end of you and your pride.",
  "Now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance, and the boy found himself on the right side of the river, he flew straight eastward, trying to seek his own country.",
  "Yes, father, willingly; only wait till daylight, then I'll set out and learn to shudder, and in that way I shall be master of an art which will gain me a living.",
  "He believed in fairies and fairy gifts, and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness, and his shoes the seven-league boots, and his purse the purse of Fortunatus!",
  "He might see something about it in the Mercure de France.",
  "Then she sat down on a sofa, and when the Prince by her entreaty had done the same she said: You are surprised, you say, that I should know you and not be known by you, but you will be no longer surprised when I inform you who I am.",
  "Struck with astonishment and sorrow, she uttered a terrible cry, and threw herself down beside the pretended King, weeping, and howling, and calling upon her eleven sisters, who were also fairies, and who came to her assistance.",
  "The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall, where several butlers met him, and he laid the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet.",
  "At first I was bent on resistance; for while I had liberty I could easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that idea with horror, remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, and the favors I had received from him.",
  "Have no pity on the old witch.",
  "Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains, and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame, opposite the window.",
  "And with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird, or a thought, over the land or over the waves of the sea, wherever the shoes know the way.",
  "He began to wonder what he should do, and to amuse himself by pretending that all the treasures he saw were his own, and considering how he would divide them among his children.",
  "All now became clear and silvery; the coasts of the moon came into sight, with white seas breaking on them; and at last the king reached the silver walls, and the gate of opal.",
  "They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo.",
  "The King took a long step, and quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air.",
  "The King did not know what to do or to say.",
  "At midday Grettel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path.",
  "He asked if it could make salt.",
  "Up and down the paths and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered, and not a trace of him could she find; until at last, quite tired, she stopped for a minute's rest, and saw that she was standing opposite the shady path she had seen in her dream.",
  "Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment, which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows.",
  "Good woman, replied Prince Ahmed, you are not so far from help as you imagine.",
  "The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden Mines -- that invincible sword which hews iron like a reed -- was up and flashing in the air!",
  "One more effort, and he wo n't be able to move!",
  "Then she fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock saying Beauty, Beauty twelve times in its musical voice, which told her at once that she was really in the palace once more.",
  "-- The Black Cat and the brethren WHO was glad to see the prince, if it was not Lady Rosalind?",
  "And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded.",
  "they 're sure to like him, a young fellow like that!",
  "said the two little animals to each other.",
  "Curdken was very angry, and would n't speak to her.",
  "So saying, she gave to the King a sword made from a single diamond, which was more brilliant than the sun.",
  "The poor child fled away from her, and went to hide herself in the forest, not far from thence.",
  "I have invited you here, gentlemen, he said, on a matter of merely private importance, but I must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties.",
  "This sounded sweetly in the tailor's ears; he put his frail little head out of the window, and shouted: up here, my good woman, and you'll find a willing customer.",
  "spoke the carrier; come along with me, and I'll soon put that right.",
  "what do you know about it?",
  "The mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp full of oil and a bottle full of pepper.",
  "Where have you put it then?",
  "I was very fond of hunting, and one day, while chasing a stag, I left my attendants far behind; suddenly I saw the animal leap into a pool of water, and I rashly urged my horse to follow it, but before we had gone many steps I felt an extraordinary heat, instead of the coolness of the water; the pond dried up, a great gulf opened before me, out of which flames of fire shot up, and I fell helplessly to the bottom of a precipice.",
  "A good many years had passed -- seventeen, in fact -- since Queen Rosalind was married, but you would not think it to look at her.",
  "It was on a Monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand, thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the Princess Goldilocks to marry the King.",
  "When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers, when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant.",
  "said the King angrily, was that all you thought of, vain child?",
  "The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment, and said, calling to her servants: You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite, and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable.",
  "The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and every year they bore the finest red and white roses.",
  "You want to know all about it, I suppose?",
  "For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return, and so put you in mind of it, that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise.",
  "A real friend is never unseasonable, answered the other.",
  "I know you are far above a little dog, but if it were right and allowable that great people should ill-treat all who are beneath them, I might at this moment beat you, or kill you, for a fairy is greater than a man.",
  "The children did all in their power, but they could n't get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly.",
  "But presently she sank softly on to a couch, in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall.",
  "His Majesty retired to his study, put his head in his hands, and thought and thought.",
  "They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree.",
  "But everyone must get his experience for himself; and when he has got it, he is lucky if it is not too late.",
  "Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws firmly.",
  "But when it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened; so, after listening and waiting for a long time, she ran down into the garden to search for him.",
  "The White Bear gave her a silver bell, and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell, and what she wanted would appear.",
  "For if she had liked the King ill before, she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly.",
  "He went out, and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on this side and that, he came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not above a hundred paces from their father's house.",
  "I am not satisfied, his Majesty went on reflecting, with this plan of changing the magical articles.",
  "But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps, carpets, purses, swords, and all, away into a dark lumber-room; for, of course, she thought that they were all nonsense, and merely old rubbish out of books, or pantomime properties.",
  "Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were.",
  "I should think so, said Ricardo, especially against those brutes of Electors; they give trouble at home sometimes.",
  "cried the poor Princess; I lose everything I love, and am none the better for it.",
  "Let me first measure it, said his wife.",
  "The next morning they started in the same chariot.",
  "Then he himself began to wonder, and muttered softly: White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?",
  "But he consoled his little sister, and said: Don't cry, Grettel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.",
  "A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity.",
  "But, sir, said the ambassador, the streets are lined with soldiers; and I know not how you have escaped them.",
  "They brought the cauldron and the loads of wood, and very soon the King was boiling away.",
  "Enrico, my boy, said his majesty, the task awaits you, and the honour.",
  "The executioner made Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to strike.",

  "Next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with the golden apple, and the first person she saw was the maiden with the long nose, who was to have the Prince.",
  "When he had opened the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless: the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder.",
  "The Queen, her mother, by her caresses and flatteries, helped to make her believe that there was nothing too good for her.",
  "how I hope he may be able to come up to the top!",
  "Are you not leaving me to my death perhaps?",
  "When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: Is it time?",
  "But they were all taken in by the image of the King, for, clever as they were, the Mermaid was still cleverer, and all they could do was to help the Fairy of the Desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave of the King of the Gold Mines.",
  "But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive, lay down at his fire, and slept till daylight.",
  "His father observed him, and said: Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain behind?",
  "Why, some electing characters might come here and kick us out!",
  "I not being handy with the pen, the Giant hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing.",
  "Then may you hold the calf's tail, and the calf's tail hold you, and may you go round the world together till day dawns!",
  "Your honour is without a stain, though it is a pity about the carpet.",
  "He gave up the throne joyfully to the Prince, and remained always the most faithful of his subjects.",
  "so he's bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home.",
  "Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out, ' A celebrated physician has come from Janina in Albania.",
  "But he never came back any more!",
  "As the time drew near she divided all her little possessions between her sisters, and said good-by to everything she loved, and when the fatal day came she encouraged and cheered her father as they mounted together the horse which had brought him back.",
  "The princess flew to her room, and returned with her book.",
  "No doubt she was trying her fortune, wondering if Ricardo cares for her a little.",
  "There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness, and it was into this bed the Ogre's wife put the seven little boys, after which she went to bed to her husband.",
  "But Duty before everything, and wreathing his royal countenance in smiles, his Majesty prepared to give Count Snoreonski an audience.",
  "I see, said she, two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.",
  "The prince felt his blood stand still, and he grew faint; but he took heart, for there was no time to waste.",
  "What a dance the attorney had that night!",
  "He had laid his sword on the grass.",
  "Here I may go no further, said the bright lady; and beyond, as you see, all is darkness and heavy sleep.",
  "The merchant was only too glad when the Beast went away, and though he could not sleep for sadness, he lay down until the sun rose.",
  "As soon as it was light, Felicia, who was very unhappy about her pot of pinks, went out to look for it, and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage.",
  "Presently they sounded more like groans; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the knees, and fastened on his very heart of fire.",
  "Now, my friend, I'll teach you to shudder, thought he.",
  "You mean, I suppose, that there is one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish.",
  "I am going to Dead Man's Hall, if only I am on the right track, answered the poor man.",
  "The prince had gone some way, when the king called after him.",
  "What reply have you, sir, to make to his Royal Highness's statements?",
  "You must creep up close to them, and as one of them passes the eye to the other you must seize it, and refuse to give it up till they have told you the way to the Three Fairies of the Garden, and they will give you the Cap of Darkness and the Sword of Sharpness, and show you how to wing beyond this world to the land of the Terrible Head.",
  "The honeymoon of Prince Prigio and the Crown Princess Rosalind was passed at the castle, where the prince had been deserted by the Court.",
  "In a moment Prince Charles's rapier was shining in the sunlight, and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude, his left hand gracefully raised and curved.",
  "Then he went on his way merrily, and being light and agile he never felt tired.",
  "But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle.",
  "I took it in the air, and gave it the necessary motion to strike against the rocks near which you found it, and I tell you that it lies in your power to make use of the favorable opportunity which presents itself to make you happy.",
  "For a moment the king was tempted; but then he said to himself: Never mind, it's only an extra penny on the income-tax.",
  "After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship's side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas.",

  "The flat, cruel head moved slower; the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer; and he gently breathed his last just as the Firedrake, too, fell over and lay exhausted.",
  "They said good-by to the Princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them.",
  "Therefore, continued the old man, you should send for a gardener whose father and grandfather have been gardeners before him, and very soon your garden will be full of green grass and gay flowers, and you will enjoy its delicious fruit.",
  "He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil.",
  "You must then demand as much wood as three mules can carry, and a great cauldron, and must shut yourself up in a room with the Sultan, and when the cauldron boils you must throw him into it, and there leave him until his flesh is completely separated from his bones.",
  "Then the false bride answered: She deserves to be put stark naked into a barrel lined with sharp nails, which should be dragged by two white horses up and down the street till she is dead.",
  "For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting.",
  "To-day I think I have fulfilled my promise of repaying you.",

  "At last, having his Majesty's leave to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, I resolved to take this opportunity.",
  "The children answered: Tis Heaven's own child, The tempest wild, and went on eating, without putting themselves about.",
  "then from the landing-net; but Dick had grown sulky.",
  "My dead cousin was here, and an old bearded man came, who showed me heaps of money down below there, but what shuddering is no one has told me.",
  "Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder; and he turned, and saw a young man like a king's son, having with him a tall and beautiful lady, whose blue eyes shone like stars.",
  "Beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to awake, but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly twelve times, and then she got up and found her dressing-table set out with everything she could possibly want; and when her toilet was finished she found dinner was waiting in the room next to hers.",
  "The rhymes were not very correct, but you see he had made them up so quickly that it is a miracle that they were not worse; especially as he was horribly frightened all the time.",
  "said the second drop of blood, and the giant believed it was the Master-maid again, and turned himself on the bench, and lay down to sleep once more.",
  "If you were clever enough to kill the creature -- and I admit that -- you were clever enough to know that what everybody said must be true.",
  "The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly: Good-evening, Beast.",
  "Then Beauty began to cry, and wandered sadly back to her own room.",
  "And in the light which flowed from their bodies King Prigio looked round at the various kinds of Solid Stupidity.",
  "And so the Prince would never tell her one word.",
  "The Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present.",
  "The better to behold him, I lay down on my side, so that my face was level with his, and he stood three yards off.",
  "This so grieved the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears and prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways.",
  "However, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore can not be deceived.",
  "cried he; are you come after the monster too?",
  "And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio, and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball.",
  "He is no favourite of mine.",
  "So the prince, for all his cleverness, was not happy.",
  "Your turn, which should have come first, has arrived at last.",
  "A more terrible and cruel beast can not be imagined; for, if you go near it, you are at once broiled by the Firedrake.",
  "And so is that of a crown prince, answered Prigio; and mine is pledged to a lady.",
  "Things were not always to go smoothly, far from it; and it was poor Jaqueline who fell into trouble next.",
  "He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking on what he had to do.",
  "father, said Hansel, I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell.",
  "Their father received the news that one of his ships, which he had believed to be lost, had come safely into port with a rich cargo.",
  "But now, said Hansel, let's go and get well away from the witch's wood.",
  "and then there was a snore, and the great hall rocked like a ship at sea.",
  "she said, turning very pale.",
  "She ran immediately to open the door, and said, hugging them: I am glad to see you, my dear children; you are very hungry and weary; and my poor Peter, thou art horribly bemired; come in and let me clean thee.",
  "The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: Snow-white and Rose-red, don't be afraid; wait, and I'll come with you.",
  "She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed.",
  "In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the Princess.",
  "The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town.",
  "Bring the horns and tail he must, or perish in the adventure.",
  "This is part of it: The violet is a blossom sweet, That droops before the day is done -- Slain by thine overpowering heat, O Sun!",
  "Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim's wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries.",
  "She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless.",
  "The sides of the hill, too, were covered with the blackened ashes of his victims, whom he had roasted when they came out to kill him.",
  "When the gray women heard that laugh they began to weep, for now they knew that a stranger had robbed them, and that they could not help themselves, and their tears froze as they fell from the hollows where no eyes were, and rattled on the icy ground of the cave.",
  "There have been monarchs, in neighbouring kingdoms, who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business; but the merest word of your Majesty is law to your loving subjects.",
  "So he marshalled them in order, and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein and cry: Prince Prigio is coming!",
  "Execute your orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom I so much and so tenderly loved.",
  "The Captain thanked him, and bade him show him the house he had marked.",
  "You are not over and above mannerly, answered the Fairy, without putting herself in a passion.",
  "Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the King: Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.",
  "said King Prigio to himself.",
  "This ended the case; and Benson, after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the steward's room, was sent back to his master, And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself.",
  "Then she touched Prigio with her golden wand with twisted serpents, and he became luminous, light raying out from him; and the dark lady, too, shone like silver in the night: and on they flew, over black rocks and black rivers, till they reached a huge mountain, like a mountain of coal, many thousand feet high, for its head was lost in the blackness of darkness.",
  "I know quite well, said the Mermaid, that the Princess is sitting by the brook-side, just where you saw her as you passed, but as you will have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her, take this sword; armed with it you may dare any danger, and overcome the greatest difficulties, only beware of one thing -- that is, never to let it fall from your hand.",
  "Twenty delightful kings did everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable, and after having spent ever so much money in giving a single entertainment thought themselves very lucky if the Princess said That's pretty.",
  "As for the king, he was only anxious to get back to Falkenstein, and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner.",
  "and he proceeded to relate the whole story, ending up with, Now what sentence should be passed?",
  "Grettel began to cry, and said: How are we ever to get out of the wood?",
  "Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin's palace, was the reply, the greatest wonder of the world?",
  "Upon which, thinking they intended to make sport of him, as had been too often the case in the kitchen, he besought his master not to mock a poor simple fellow, who intended them no harm, but let him go about his business.",
  "It is quite ready, said the third drop of blood.",
  "Do not think that you can deceive me; you fancy you are going to escape, but I assure you that you are going to stay here and the first thing I shall give you to do will be to keep my sheep -- they are very good company and speak quite as well as you do.",
  "The Queen grew white and her heart sank, but she replied: We owe it to him on account of his great fidelity.",
  "Of this woman, too, she inquired if she knew the way to the Prince, and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.",
  "He fetched some bread out of a cupboard, cut a round off the loaf, and spread the jam on it.",
  "She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth, but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short.",
  "Jaqueline fairly screamed at hearing this awful news.",
  "And when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.",
  "Her heart is buried, if I may say so, with poor Alphonso.",
  "Ali Baba, he said, showing him the gold piece, you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold.",
  "The king, as he had been instructed, turned a knob of gold in the saddle of the Flying Horse, then kissed his hand to the ladies, and, giving the steed his head, cried, in excellent Persian: To the moon!",
  "-- and when they said they had n't, he sneered; and when they said they had, he found them out.",
  "Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house.",
  "The queen accompanied him, remarking that she was sound asleep, but would waken presently.",
  "Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, when, stealing away into a by-path, they there left them.",
  "Thou knowest; why should we instruct thee?",
  "In an instant he felt a cat's claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease!",
  "Is there no escape for him?",
  "A bronze ring that is hidden under a cushion.",
  "Walk on until you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp.",
  "If you are clever, you will find it best not to let people know it -- if you want them to like you.",
  "Do your duty; for me, Prigio est pret; -- for this was his motto, and meant that he was ready.",
  "Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a Dandie Dinmont terrier, named Pepper, and the king, who understood the motive of this precaution, silently approved.",
  "They could not make out why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; but soon they were all laughing and happy again.",
  "She flew out of Dick's coat, and stung old King James on his royal nose.",
  "Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the Court.",
  "The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said: It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let everyone make trial.",
  "The multitude of shops, stocked with all sorts of merchandise, as the finest linens from several parts of India, some painted in the most lively colors, and representing beasts, trees, and flowers; silks and brocades from Persia, China, and other places, porcelain both from Japan and China, and tapestries, surprised him so much that he knew not how to believe his own eyes; but when he came to the goldsmiths and jewelers he was in a kind of ecstacy to behold such prodigious quantities of wrought gold and silver, and was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other jewels exposed to sale.",
  "But, presently, the captain of the golden ship found it necessary to take a long voyage, and after embracing his wife tenderly he embarked.",
  "Now, young man, said the rich stranger, I am going to give you a vessel which will take you back to your own country.",
  "He stood there in the night, like one who meant harm.",
  "The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle, but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple.",
  "This done, fasten thy claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface.",
  "Then he called for a servant, to order luncheon for the shopkeepers, and paper for them to write their orders on.",
  "The tail is like the iron handle of a pump, but the horns are genuine.",
  "Next morning they, and the ambassador, who had been told all the story, and Lady Rosalind, floated comfortably on the carpet back to Falkenstein, where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico.",
  "He was called Charming, and everyone loved him, excepting a few envious people who were angry at his being the King's favorite and knowing all the State secrets.",
  "You may sit on my back, and then I can carry you there.",
  "said the third gray woman; shall we never find it again, and see old times coming back?",
  "To my Lord Marquis of Carabas, replied the reapers, and the King was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon.",
  "The little Prince had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas!",
  "If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it, she was so awful; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face.",
  "In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain underground, for they can't work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.",
  "The dead cat lay there, like any common cat.",
  "But then -- would you believe he could be so mean?",
  "And then she gave her the golden spinning-wheel, saying: Perhaps you may find that you have a use for it.",
  "So he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added: You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did.",
  "cried the king in horror; and in this disguise!",
  "The next hall which the Fairy led the Prince into, and where the cloth was laid for the feast, was the last apartment the Prince had not seen, and not in the least inferior to the others.",
  "So poor Prince Darling was terribly hungry all day long, but he was very patient about it.",
  "A king's ransom would hardly have procured all that my other daughters asked.",
  "Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about you for?",
  "But when he had come down from off the hill he rode away, and that so fast that no one knew what had become of him.",
  "He was determined to see, and went through the door into the fourth room.",
  "The King and Queen were in despair, and the King spake: Ah!",
  "Bellissima, she said, I do wish you would not be so proud.",
  "You have only to ask me for anything you want and I promise that I will give it to you.",

  "When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley.",
  "Then there came a whisper, like the breath of the bitter east wind on a wintry day: Where are you, and how can I come to you?",
  "The queen took her place at the edge of the carpet; I sat between her and the butler, and she said, ' I wish we were in Gluckstein!",
  "You may imagine it was no easy adventure.",
  "I promised your father, said she sternly, to give you good advice, and to punish you if you refused to follow it.",
  "However, when he was told all about the pores of the skin, and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed, he at once ceased to resist, for he was very reasonable.",
  "Well, he shone nearly as brightly as the coal-heaps that thou art always lying raking among, dirty black creature that thou art!",

  "Oh, how I should have liked to see him too!",
  "Then, of course, the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was admired by the crown prince, who was on bad terms with the king of the country; and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassador -- however, they are used to them.",

  "By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife's folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share.",
  "But no one was within hearing, and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells.",

  "He begged her to explain this riddle, which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it.",
  "I have the king now, he said; for if I can't find the ashes of my brothers, by Jove!",
  "Now, the Firedrake is a beast, or bird, about the bigness of an elephant.",
  "But as we left home before dinner, and as yours is over, may I request your lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take something cold?",
  "But when he got home to the King's palace one of his brothers was just going to be married, and the bride and all her kith and kin had come to the palace; so they all thronged round him, and questioned him about this and that, and wanted him to go in with them; but he behaved as if he did not see them, and went straight to the stable, and got out the horses and began to harness them.",
  "Encouraged by this advice, the white, slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again, more and more of him uncoiling, as if the mountain were quite full of him.",
  "said the prince softly to himself; and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness, stuck on the cap of darkness, girdled himself with the sword of sharpness, and put a good slice of bread, with some cold tongue, in a wallet, which he slung on his back.",
  "The dream of the second was that the King had brought her a spinning wheel and a distaff, that she might spin him some shirts.",

  "It is just beginning, said the first drop of blood on the stool.",
  "Great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano, and nearly hit him several times.",
  "The poor one immediately thanked him, and promised this.",
  "On the credit of the crier, the Prince accepted the conditions, and concluded the bargain; and, having got the master's leave, they went into his back shop; they both sat down on it, and as soon as the Prince formed his wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan he presently found himself and the crier there; and, as he wanted not a more sufficient proof of the virtue of the tapestry, he counted the crier out forty pieces of gold, and gave him twenty pieces for himself.",

  "The young ladies of the court disliked dancing with him, in spite of his good looks, because he was always asking, Have you read this?",
  "Then Benson says: ` Dinner'll be ready in five minutes; how tired I do feel!",
  "after him, and the young Queen's two sisters came running up, and threw their arms round her neck, and kissed her a thousand times, and then there was such a laughing and crying, talking and kissing, all at once, and Miranda thanked her father, and began to ask after everyone -- particularly the Captain of the Guard, to whom she owed so much; but, to her great sorrow, she heard that he was dead.",

  "The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.",
  "He spent most of the royal income on public objects, and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of.",
  "Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate, and the king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico.",
  "Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as much as he liked, it did him no good.",
  "The people were much distressed, and came and broke the palace win-dows -- as they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia.",

  "And as she drank thus, and leaned right over the water, the rag containing the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated down the stream, and she in her anxiety never even noticed her loss.",
  "Oh, don't be angry with me, cried the Princess, clasping her hands.",
  "To tell the truth, I was so lost in admiration of her beautiful slave that I forgot everything else, and the cruel Ragotte, perceiving this, turned upon her so furious and terrible a look that she fell lifeless to the ground.",
  "What should you say if anybody wanted to steal that?",
  "He then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters ' chamber, and, coming to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were every soul of them fast asleep, except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about his brothers ', the Ogre, feeling the golden crowns, said: I should have made a fine piece of work of it, truly; I find I drank too much last night.",
  "asked the princess, taking no notice of his bandaged hand.",
  "Lovely Blanchette, said the Prince, how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me?",
  "No, indeed, cried the mouse with the cropped ears; the credit is mine.",
  "McDougal, drag the first man that shouts to the serpent-house in the zoological gardens, and lock him up with the rattlesnakes!",
  "Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him.",
  "and the three drops of blood replied: If your mother only knew, Her heart would surely break in two.",
  "As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders, and held it up like a mirror, so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it, and did not see the Terrible Head itself.",
  "Soon after this the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, called for his servants, as his custom was, in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom, for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune.",

  "Trust me with the flask, for I know all the ways of the Gloomy Cavern, and can fill it from the Fountain of Beauty.",
  "What a pity it is that men do nothing but torment and persecute poor creatures which never do them any harm!",
  "When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain, and then, striving again to get loose, they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first, and some of them tried to stab me with their spears; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket, which they could not pierce.",
  "With her bright eyes, and the charming color in her cheeks, she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it.",
  "madam, the King of the Gold Mines said to her how is this?",
  "When he had gone, the prince threw himself at the king's feet, crying: Pardon, pardon, my liege!",
  "said the King of the Sheep.",
  "He then grasped them and rose to the surface, letting the water flow over the flower.",
  "I really can not follow you, said Miranda, for I am too tired to walk another step.",
  "I don't want you to promise me in a hurry.",
  "We come from a far distant country.",
  "Charming, said the Princess, the name promises well; I have no doubt that he is good looking and fascinates everybody.",
  "I'll come in and help you.",
  "Has anyone failed to treat you with due respect?",
  "said the dark lady, pointing to the bright moon of earth, shining far off in the heavens.",
  "said his majesty, in a sulky voice.",
  "I don't understand, said the Giant, replacing his head on his shoulders.",
  "Nobody had ever been into it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else.",
  "Then Charming's enemies said to the King: It is a wonder that you are not jealous, the Queen thinks there is nobody in the world like Charming.",
  "said poor Jaqueline, feeling very uncomfortable; for the king had never lectured her before.",
  "Glad you like it, said the king, much pleased.",
  "After wandering about a long time he reached an island inhabited by mice.",
  "He does not spell very well, as you say, but I sometimes make mistakes myself; and I like his spirit.",
  "Beast, how you frightened me!",
  "That I will, said Whittington, with all my heart; I will work for you if you will let me.",
  "Then came the giant home with the goats.",
  "Then make your choice of the best sort of Stupidity for your purpose, said the dark lady.",

  "Presently they sat down to the banquet, and the King asked Miranda to tell them all that had happened to her since the terrible morning when he had sent the Captain of the Guard to fetch her.",
  "with a bound it turned over, upside down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him.",
  "Fairy Paribanou sat in this hall on a throne of massive gold, enriched with diamonds, rubies, and pearls of an extraordinary size, and attended on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies, all richly clothed.",
  "Again the other knights called to him, and said that he might just as well give up the attempt to ride up the glass hill, for it was useless to try; but the knight paid no heed to that, but rode straight away to the glass hill, and went still farther up than the knight in copper armor had gone; but when he had ridden two-thirds of the way up he turned his horse around, and rode down again.",
  "Jaqueline was somewhat comforted at these words, dropped out of the Giant's lips from a considerable height.",
  "The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba's asking him what that was, he replied: It is, sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them.",
  "Then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed.",
  "These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper about them, made an exact list of everything they saw, which I afterward translated into English, and which ran as follows: In the right coat pocket of the great Man-Mountain we found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to cover the carpet of your Majesty's chief room of state.",
  "Why, if it had not been for all these fairy presents, the Cap of Darkness and all the rest of them, you never could have killed the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast, and -- you never could have married me, the queen added, in a happy whisper, blushing beautifully, for that was a foolish habit of hers.",
  "And to make her more vain than ever the Queen caused her portrait to be taken by the cleverest painters and sent it to several neighboring kings with whom she was very friendly.",
  "But the old King stood outside at the stove chimney, and listened to her words.",
  "For my part, said the eldest, I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.",
  "Then the boy would try his strength with the rest, but he threw the quoit so far that it went beyond what had ever been thrown before, and fell in the crowd, striking a man so that he died.",
  "He drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast, and then went to the horsemen and said: The deed is done, I 've put an end to the two of them; but I assure you it has been no easy matter, for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves; but all that's of no use against one who slays seven men at a blow.",
  "Six maids of honor carried her train, and she leaned upon the arm of another.",
  "But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for; because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted, and that, as long as the Firedrake lived, everyone who came there fell asleep.",
  "But as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sight -- a beautiful girl chained to a stake at the high-water mark of the sea.",
  "Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed, and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds, and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold.",
  "Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her, and even found her rather in the way, so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers, who begged her to stay, and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say good-by to them.",
  "The modern world has no room for them.",
  "There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms.",
  "But she only gave him answers that told him nothing.",
  "There is no great harm done yet, and perhaps they would not believe you if you did explain; but just think, if some people ceased to believe in Science, what would they have left to believe in?",
  "But he was soon set at ease, for, the channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud voice: Long live the most puissant Emperor of Lilliput!",
  "And there was a little heap of grey ashes.",
  "cried she, the lions are coming.",
  "Bid me bring you something -- anything -- from the ends of the earth, and it shall be in your hands.",
  "With one final roar, like the breath of a thousand furnaces, the Firedrake expired.",
  "The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.",
  "He then presented King Prigio with a large diamond, and came down into the courtyard to see him mount.",
  "Now the Dreadful Women were akin to the Three Gray Sisters, and it was hard for them to tell the boy the way.",
  "And now lie down till evening.",
  "Then he ran upstairs, for the last time, to the fairy garret, and he put on the wishing cap.",
  "When Christmas Eve came, the poor one had not a bite in the house, either of meat or bread; so he went to his brother, and begged him, in God's name, to give him something for Christmas Day.",
  "Night draws near, and it will be time to go to supper.",
  "There might be a cure for that, said the White Bear, if you would but promise me never to talk with your mother alone, but only when the others are there too; for she will take hold of your hand, he said, and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone; but that you must by no means do, or you will bring great misery on both of us.",
  "He went on and on for the livelong day, and at nightfall he came to a place where there was a bright light.",
  "The woman, who had hoped to find a good market, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumbling wrathfully.",
  "How have you got on this time?",
  "He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out.",
  "You may say what you please, said the Princess.",
  "On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour.",
  "He understood me very well, and, descending from the stage, commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides, on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food, which had been sent by the King's orders when he first received tidings of me.",
  "I answered in few words, but in the most submissive manner; and, being almost famished with hunger, I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.",
  "But the young King spoke: Who knows for what good purpose he does it?",
  "But the queen is a very remarkable woman -- very remarkable -- Very!",
  "He called up Prigio before the whole Court, and thereon the courtiers cheered like anything, but the king cried: Silence!",
  "Oh, sire, I will tell you everything!",
  "I had one private pocket which escaped their search, containing a pair of spectacles and a small spy-glass, which, being of no consequence to the Emperor, I did not think myself bound in honor to discover.",
  "You are the person, said the King, and you have passed sentence on yourself; and even so it shall be done to you.",
  "Well, we shall soon see whether you have watched the meadow or not, answered the brothers, but when they got there the grass was all standing just as long and as thick as it had been the night before.",
  "But he did n't dare to send him away, for he feared he might kill him along with his people, and place himself on the throne.",
  "And the Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him, then.",
  "She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house.",
  "The ambassador looked about, and seemed to miss someone, and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants, who answered also in a low voice, and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador.",
  "They were very poor, and their seven children incommoded them greatly, because not one of them was able to earn his bread.",
  "When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long.",
  "This morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun shone, and all the fountains were playing; but she was astonished to find that every place was familiar to her, and presently she came to the brook where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the Prince in her dream, and that made her think more than ever that he must be kept a prisoner by the Beast.",
  "The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy, and presently I fell asleep.",
  "An enchanted prince or princess, said Prigio, such as I have often read of.",
  "Her majesty's expressions are ever choice and appropriate, said the Ambassador.",
  "He alone can cure the King and give him back the strength of his youth.",
  "Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly: Not yet, but presently.",
  "The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood; and he might have the huntsmen to help him.",
  "But Trusty John said: I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before.",
  "For as to what we have heard you say, that there are other kingdoms in the world, inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are very doubtful, and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars, because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his Majesty's dominions.",
  "They stole down softly into the garden, and got over the wall.",
  "What is to be done to undeceive her?",
  "On the third night he sat down again on his bench, and said, in the most desponding way: If I could only shudder!",
  "In vain he strove to separate the teeth, when the crow, stooping from the heavens, became the Princess Jaqueline, and changed Dick into a wren -- a tiny bird, so small that he easily flew out of the jaws of the Giant and winged his way to a tree, whence he watched the scene.",
  "At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife had to pull the clothes off him, and pour the pail full of little gudgeons over him, so that the little fish swam all about him.",
  "I say, though, he said, what about my father?",
  "But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given orders to fit up; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be free from me.",
  "they can not understand the simplest thing.",
  "Then he pointed out, in the most considerate manner, that their religion was not all he could wish, otherwise they would never sacrifice young ladies to wild birds and Earthquakers.",
  "He did tell them about the flying carpet, however, which of course did not much surprise them, because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works.",
  "He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress, and at the same moment a stately lady appeared, and said very gravely: Ah!",
  "But, in to-day's affair he owes his safety entirely to himself and Pepper, for he had not seen the wasp.",
  "In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife: Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.",
  "On coming to the Princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity.",
  "Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess?",
  "But no one had anything to show.",
  "Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive it from the hand of another.",
  "but I think he must be, said Felicia.",
  "The people, indeed, looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd.",
  "But, not to mention the richness of the furniture, which was inestimable, there was such a profuseness throughout that the Prince, instead of ever having seen anything like it, owned that he could not have imagined that there was anything in the world that could come up to it.",
  "` Yes, ' said I; ` how did you manage it?",
  "In short, the experiment succeeded, and the Prince, after he had counted out to the crier forty purses, and he had delivered the apple to him, waited patiently for the first caravan that should return to the Indies, and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the Princes Houssain and Ali waited for him.",
  "William said at last, rather as if he were making a speech: Your royaliness, and my lords and ladies, it was like this.",
  "And, as the Princess Goldilocks showed no sign of relenting, he started with his little dog for the Gloomy Cavern.",
  "I wish I could see you; and, horrible to relate, he rose on a pair of wide, flaming wings, and came right at the prince, guided by the sound of his voice.",
  "But at last the eyes within the skull looked up and saw him, and then the man gave a great cry, rent his glittering dress of serpentskin, and held up his hands.",
  "He had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.",
  "Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone.",
  "They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they could n't distinguish.",
  "One, in particular, was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I., my own grandmother.",
  "Then a man entered, of more than ordinary size and of a very fearful appearance; but he was old and had a white beard.",
  "So the king, who had scarcely eaten any breakfast, much to the annoyance of the queen, who was not agitated by eclipses, went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them.",
  "So, with the same escort, she set out, and reached the palace as the marriage ceremony began.",
  "Old Green Stocking is in despair over your ignorance.",
  "Forget the maiden, said the King, and take another bride; but the Prince said he could never love another.",
  "Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among the quality.",
  "But difficulties only sharpened the ingenuity of this admirable king.",
  "Dick got excited, and stumbled about the boat from stern to bow, tripping over Jaqueline's feet, and nearly upsetting the vessel in his hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding.",
  "If he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet and she would give him whatever he asked for, which had made him self-willed; also she had told him from morning to night that he would one day be a king, and that kings were very happy, because everyone was bound to obey and respect them, and no one could prevent them from doing just as they liked.",
  "Then the first sister passed the eye to the second, but as the second groped for it the boy caught it cleverly out of her hand.",
  "Then she gave her the gold carding-comb, for it might, perhaps, be of use to her, she said.",
  "But she took no notice at all; and the fairies went each to her own country, and none of them stayed there at the palace, where nobody believed in them, except the king, a little.",
  "But consider, it would have been of little use if you had not been acquainted with the Princess's illness by Prince Ali's glass, and Prince Ahmed had not applied his artificial apple.",
  "At last she saw before her a great plain, quite covered with all sorts of flowers, the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks.",
  "The sexton's wife waited a long time for her husband, but he never appeared.",
  "And, that you may better comprehend what it is, I must tell you it is the fruit of the study and experiments of a celebrated philosopher of this city, who applied himself all his lifetime to the study and knowledge of the virtues of plants and minerals, and at last attained to this composition, by which he performed such surprising cures in this town as will never be forgot, but died suddenly himself, before he could apply his sovereign remedy, and left his wife and a great many young children behind him, in very indifferent circumstances, who, to support her family and provide for her children, is resolved to sell it.",
  "Neither of them said Good-night to the prince.",
  "When the two brothers got to the glass hill, all the princes and knights were trying to ride up it, and their horses were in a foam; but it was all in vain, for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than down they slipped, and there was not one which could get even so much as a couple of yards up.",
  "So he wished she were in her family pyramid, in the Egyptian desert, and in a second the sofa was unoccupied.",
  "Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him.",
  "In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty: she would not consent to it; she was indeed poor, but she was their mother.",
  "There were other valuable objects, but these were the most useful and celebrated.",
  "The merchant, in ecstacies with all he saw and heard, said to himself: All this must be meant for me.",
  "I do not ask either of these things for my son, replied the good King; but if you will make him the best of princes, I shall indeed be grateful to you.",
  "Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter, he could not help laughing at this threat.",
  "The quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs, sir!",
  "All this succeeded according to his desire; for, the Ogre waking about midnight, and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done over-night, threw himself hastily out of bed, and, taking his great knife, Let us see, said he, how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs of the matter.",
  "they said, what can this great hero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land?",
  "He stole forth secretly in front, and when the youth was up above, and had turned round to grasp the bell-rope, he saw, standing opposite the hole of the belfry, a white figure.",
  "The monkey was called Grabugeon, and the little dog Tintin.",
  "Does your royal highness not know, he asked, that you are in considerable danger?",
  "And even if there were -- but, no matter; pray let us drop the subject.",
  "Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt.",
  "The Sultan received and embraced him with great joy, complaining at the same time, with a fatherly tenderness, of the affliction his long absence had been to him, which he said was the more grievous for that, fortune having decided in favor of Prince Ali his brother, he was afraid he might have committed some rash action.",
  "Jaqueline, after a few moments, recovered her senses fully, and changing herself into an eagle, tried to fly up and out.",
  "The Prince returned and told the Fairy what his father had said; There's a great deal of wickedness in this demand?",
  "Well, if it gets no worse than that, I can manage to stand it, thought Cinderlad.",
  "He hid the truth from them at first, only saying sadly to Beauty as he gave her the rose: Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know what it has cost.",
  "It's no use, he said; I have not a fly that will suit.",
  "The very face of the Dwarf, even seen through rose-coloured spectacles, made him nearly ill.",
  "well, he replied, out of charity I will take her; but be sure and don't forget that she is mine.",
  "Let my ship appear as it was before.",
  "The King comforted her, and said: Leave your bedroom door open to-night, my servants shall stand outside, and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter, bind him fast, and carry him on to a ship, which shall sail away out into the wide ocean.",
  "Take a rose to Beauty, and remember your promise!",
  "And when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed.",
  "What on earth am I to do with the young man?",
  "And then he mounted his horse and rode off with Galifron's head.",
  "There he saw an elderly gentleman, in a great curled wig, sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree.",
  "Lastly, the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms, and left them all very contented.",
  "As the Fairy Paribanou pronounced these last words with a different tone, and looked, at the same time, tenderly upon Prince Ahmed, with a modest blush on her cheeks, it was no hard matter for the Prince to comprehend what happiness she meant.",
  "Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.",
  "After all the Prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter.",
  "And he tried to take Molinda's hand, but she snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the palace, leaving Prince Prigio to feel foolish, for once, and ashamed.",
  "Then he lifted him out, sat down at the fire, laid him on his knee, and rubbed his arms that the blood should circulate again.",
  "Next day the brothers were for setting out again, and this time too Cinderlad begged them to let him go with them and see who rode; but no, they said he was not fit to do that, for he was much too ugly and dirty.",
  "And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out.",
  "And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that he killed the Firedrake -- for he must have got to Falkenstein by now, -- and they will be for marrying him to the king's niece, and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of Pantouflia!",
  "The princess blushed very much, and felt very happy.",
  "Never mind, said his Majesty, comforting her.",
  "If you do not do this I will land all my cats upon your island, and you shall be exterminated.",
  "Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him.",
  "THE MASTER-MAID Once upon a time there was a king who had many sons.",
  "The gardener's son said to him: What is your name, what is your family, and from what country do you come?",
  "She wept and lamented, but all in vain, for go he must.",
  "May I remind your royal highness that Falkenstein is three hundred miles away?",
  "The ambassador looked about, and seemed to miss someone, and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants, who answered also in a low voice, and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador.",
  "He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.",
  "There is not much pleasure in sport that is easy and certain.",
  "Mortuus est Romae -- ` He died at Rome.",
  "Jaqueline placed her foot on this curious thing, when a voice came, like thunder heard through a feather-bed: Not near time to get up yet!",
  "He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman -- whom he murdered.",
  "There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer.",
  "Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly.",
  "When the ladies left, and the prince and the other gentlemen were alone, the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever.",
  "Near him were two boys, not quite so old as Prince Ricardo.",
  "This proves how anxious he was, or, being so clever and learned, he would have remembered that her name was Andromeda.",
  "And he grew so fierce, that even the queen was afraid of him now.",
  "I am the daughter of one of the most powerful and distinguished genies, and my name is Paribanou.",
  "Why, if you can not make a girl like that do as you wish, your subjects will soon forget that they are only put into this world for our pleasure.",
  "At the first glimmer of dawn Frisk began to jump about, and when he had waked Charming they went out together, first into the garden, and then down to the river's brink, where they wandered up and down.",
  "That is what I am called, sir, he said, by those who give me the title which is mine by right.",
  "Thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly.",
  "It is quite true, now I come to think of it, said the King.",
  "Fetch thy cat, boy, said the merchant, and send her.",
  "Greet the King, and tell him that, if he is too good to come to me, I am too good to come to him, replied the Master-maid.",
  "A little way off stood a splendid palace, the walls of which were of transparent emeralds.",
  "Of punishment I am a glutton, or so my friends are pleased to say.",
  "Miranda kissed her little dog, crying so bitterly, that at last she could bear it no longer, and turned away into the forest.",
  "Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him, and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat, for he had had nothing for three days, and he was a poor country boy, and knew nobody, and nobody would employ him.",
  "Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other.",
  "When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father's court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands.",
  "What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?",
  "He stopped to listen in spite of Charming's enemies, who tried to persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor.",
  "No, said the gardener's son.",
  "Next morning he rose very early, before anyone else was up, that he might not have to say Good-bye to Lady Rosalind.",
  "First, sir, pursued the crier, presenting the ivory pipe to the Prince, observe that this pipe is furnished with a glass at both ends; and consider that by looking through one of them you see whatever object you wish to behold.",
  "When Jaqueline had made the crocodiles ' eggs, with millet-seed and sugar-candy, into a cake for the Dwarf's lions, Ricardo announced that his preparations were complete.",
  "However, the king shouted very loud, as he always did when he meant to be obeyed, and the prince sauntered slowly back again.",
  "THE MASTER CAT; OR, PUSS IN BOOTS There was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than his mill, his ass, and his cat.",
  "But, in the centre of the chief square of the town, was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers.",
  "Now the Princess's horse was called Falada, and could speak.",
  "For a long time he bewailed his sad fate like this, and then, seeing that it was growing dark, and that still there was no sign of the Princess, he set out as fast as he could in the direction of the town.",
  "Your every wish shall be gratified.",
  "Such are, or rather such were, the toils of monarchs!",
  "If you had refused to help me I should have been certain that you were wicked.",
  "Do me the favor to be my guest as long as you remain in my capital.",
  "Does the proud girl wish to make me her slave?",
  "When I woke, it was just daylight.",
  "In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone, and did not bow to him.",
  "Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull, knee-deep in snow; and still the Remora climbed and climbed.",
  "Being naturally timid, the silence began to terrify him, and he resolved to search once more through all the rooms; but it was of no use.",
  "Then he went down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet.",
  "My miserable sheep's face displeases her, and without Miranda what is left to me, wretched creature that I am!",
  "no, father: nothing will induce me to go there, it makes me shudder!",
  "You need not be afraid of that, answered the Mermaid, the Princess thinks of no one but you, and the frightful Dwarf can not persuade her to look at him.",
  "In vain, however, for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him.",
  "Now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow, and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the Gray Sisters.",
  "But while she was thus enjoying herself with the King and her sisters, the King of the Sheep was waiting impatiently for the time of her return, and when it came and went, and no Princess appeared, his anxiety became so great that he could bear it no longer.",
  "So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice.",
  "Now, apply this moral to dragon-killing with magic instruments.",
  "She replied that nothing would please her better, but that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry, and she recommended them to go and talk to the Princess about it themselves so this they at once did.",
  "I did n't throw anything, growled the first one.",
  "The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan.",
  "Now, just as they were forming a procession to march into church, who should appear but the queen!",
  "That is to hear the better, my child.",
  "And then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the Prince, who had meanwhile been greeting the Fairy and receiving her congratulations.",
  "However, what I have got will do very well.",
  "But I plainly protested that I would never be the means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery; and though the wisest of the Ministers were of my opinion, my open refusal was so opposed to his Majesty's ambition that he could never forgive me.",
  "Well, it is in Italy, and it was besieged lately.",
  "He is the only one, if you notice, sir, of all the scoundrels about whom our ancestors inform us, who escaped the doom which he richly merited at the sword of a good knight.",
  "The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all.",
  "You see, Charming, I could not leave my kingdom without taking some of it with me.",
  "I'll tell you what, husband, answered the woman; early to-morrow morning we'll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we'll go on to our work and leave them alone.",
  "Dick sprang from his saddle, but so terrific was the appearance of his adversary, and so dazzling was the sheen of the diamond sword, that he put his hand in his pocket, drew out, as he supposed, the sham Cap of Darkness, and placed it on his head.",
  "He did tell them about the flying carpet, however, which of course did not much surprise them, because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works.",
  "No, thought he to himself, I wo n't wish that.",
  "Before he went to bed, the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat.",
  "What you smell so, said his wife, must be the calf which I have just now killed and flayed.",
  "The cruel fairy had made him so.",
  "The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren arose to count over the cash and settle the business for that day.",
  "When he spoke she raised her head and looked round, but his voice only seemed to frighten her.",
  "In leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank, where she had lain till she was nearly dead.",
  "He then went back to a table in a corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him.",
  "The Giant hopes no bad blood; and I am, Yours very faithfully, THE G., & c. P.S. -- His little woman sends her congratulations.",
  "Her mother did not believe her in the least, but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.",
  "Not even a servant was to be seen; there was no sign of life in the palace!",
  "'\nThen the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind, and she said it was rather a short engagement, but she supposed young people understood their own affairs best.",
  "Now when the rich brother saw all that there was at the banquet and in the house, he was both vexed and angry, for he grudged everything his brother had.",
  "We will pay your debts, they said.",
  "I wish you 'd been in Jericho first.",
  "At last the happy day came.",
  "In spite of his weariness the howling of the wolves kept him awake, and even when at last the day broke he was not much better off, for the falling snow had covered up every path, and he did not know which way to turn.",
  "Now all this time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most modest way; for, as he said: I did n't kill him: and it is really the Remora, poor fellow, who should marry Molly; but he's dead.",
  "While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that, while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, though he had cried out: Thieves!",
  "His body was yellow and green, and his claws scarlet, and his tail was so long that it lay in a hundred coils.",
  "But she does not expect to be looked at, he thought; and I wo n't!",
  "She stood in the same place as before, and the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for her.",
  "The prince then said that whoever had killed the monster could, of course, tell where to find him, and could bring his hoofs.",
  "Does nothing better occur to you than that?",
  "The King also thought that this was both just and proper, so he sent five of his best men down to the gilded hut, to greet the maiden courteously from the King, and to beg her to be so good as to come up to the palace to dinner at mid-day.",
  "There came thither the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.",
  "` You have not generally found it so?",
  "By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself; and as for the inhabitants, I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw.",
  "he said: but I sha 'n' t learn it here either.",
  "He hunted the castle through in vain, and then went out to the stable-yard; but all the dogs, of course, had been taken away, and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry.",
  "After several voyages, I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard, master of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South Sea.",
  "Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle, where nobody went for fear of ghosts, ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein.",
  "Prodding him with the sword would only stir him up and make him more vicious.",
  "Don't imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought you up; your mother was a queen who had six girls already, and the King threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she should have her head cut off.",
  "Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace.",
  "You will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get to it at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse, and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine: perhaps she can tell you about him.",
  "If you had but held out for the space of one year I should have been free.",
  "Wait, he said I'll heat you up a bit, went to the fire, warmed his hand, and laid it on the man's face, but the dead remained cold.",
  "There is something inside that would appall you, he answered.",
  "Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball.",
  "And an instant afterward Miranda saw them coming toward her, and their presence gave her the greatest pleasure, though they did not come near enough for her to touch them.",
  "Next morning he told this to the maidens, and they said that the charmed cake had caused it, and advised him to listen well to the birds, and see what they could tell him, and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage.",
  "Then he related to her all that had passed, and they lived together happily ever afterward.",
  "As the Princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful, you may imagine what a delightful journey the Prince found it, for everything the Princess said seemed to him quite charming.",
  "He seems to think that he is so much handsomer than you that the Princess would have fallen in love with him and followed him willingly.",
  "TRUSTY JOHN Once upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to himself, I am most likely on my death-bed.",
  "My Princess, said he, as I do not remember I ever did or designed anybody an injury, I can not believe anybody can have a thought of doing me one, but if they have I shall not, nevertheless, forbear doing good whenever I have an opportunity.",
  "No such luck, said he; I made myself merry.",
  "He can't stay here for ever; and without his carpet he can't get away, for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street.",
  "Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.",
  "They all declared that they had not seen the prince, nor ever had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town.",
  "He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber.",
  "How did you get on in England, Dick?",
  "She thereupon told him the whole story; and so the King's son fell in love with her, and, considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion, conducted her to the palace of the King his father, and there married her.",
  "I'll put him on the throne of his fathers; it's as easy as shelling peas: and as for that other fellow, the Elector, I'll send him back to Hanover, wherever that may be, and he can go on electing, and polling his vote in peace and quietness, at home.",
  "I beg that you will set me at liberty, and then I shall hope to answer you fittingly.",
  "At last she heard the bleating of a sheep, and said to herself: No doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks; they will show me the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl.",
  "When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley.",
  "Well, he is the greatest villain in history, said Ricardo.",
  "But the King spake: Silence!",
  "Yes, and there's no ferry-boat either, answered Grettel; but look, there swims a white duck; if I ask her she'll help us over, and she called out: Here are two children, mournful very, Seeing neither bridge nor ferry; Take us upon your white back, And row us over, quack, quack!",
  "It is no more than right, he said; for had I gone first, neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen.",
  "It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons.",
  "Every morning he would climb the turret and sweep the horizon, and even much beyond the horizon, with the ivory spy-glass.",
  "This gave them new life, for the poor people were almost famished.",
  "Moreover, you are now preparing, contrary to the duty of a faithful subject, to voyage to the Court of Blefuscu.",
  "The captain landed and ran to the palace, where he found the wicked old man asleep.",
  "He opened, with his sword, the enormous letter, which was couched in the following terms: The Giant as does not know when he has had enuf, presents his compliments to Prince Ricardo; and I, having recovered from the effects of our little recent rally, will be happy to meet you in the old place for a return-match.",
  "At last he became so ill his life was despaired of, and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned.",
  "I asked them to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master, whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country.",
  "And the Princess sang a song over him, and this was her song: Child, my child, how sound you sleep!",
  "Charming, said he, it was very generous of you to rescue a poor raven; I am not ungrateful, some day I will repay you.",
  "no, do not go, for if you go home to the King's palace you will forget me, I foresee that.",
  "On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise.",
  "Everything that is horrid happened, said Dick; and then, unable to keep it any longer to himself, he said: I 've failed to keep my promise; I 've been insulted, I 've been beaten by a fellow younger than myself; and, oh!",
  "When he got in, everything happened just as the old man had said it would: all the people, great and small, came round him like ants on an ant-hill, and each tried to outbid the other for the ham.",
  "In my time one saw them at parties, theatres, balls, and promenades every day.",
  "But -- how to get to the moon?",
  "come down at once; here's a surprise for you!",
  "Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf.",
  "What we have to say can be said at any time, she answered.",
  "Then she said: The Princess must see this, she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have.",
  "He was very much concerned; the difficulty he foresaw was to make them agree, and that the two youngest should consent to yield her up to their elder brother.",
  "Indeed, sir, answered the merchant, he was in his right senses yesterday; I can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we have, and the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be sold.",
  "As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother even doted on her eldest daughter and at the same time had a horrible aversion for the youngest -- she made her eat in the kitchen and work continually.",
  "we know; an old sorcerer has taken possession of it, and now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in his mouth by night.",
  "When they went away, the rest of the company slipped off quietly, and the king was left alone with the ambassador; for the queen could hardly be said to count.",
  "But these rebels, the Bigendians, have found so much encouragement at the Emperor of Blefuscu's Court, to which they always fled for refuge, that a bloody war, as I said, has been carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons; and now the Blefuscudians have equipped a large fleet, and are preparing to descend upon us.",
  "He made his simple preparations, and announced that he would be back in time for luncheon.",
  "God knows what there was to make you two so frightened.",
  "And still nobody said a word.",
  "Then he walked on and the voice called again: Charming, Charming!",
  "That was a very convenient mosquito, though I don't know how Dick was able to observe it from any distance.",
  "Get there I must, said she; and if there is any way of going I will; and I have no fear, no matter how fast you go.",
  "But on seeing Prince Prigio, who was lolling in a hammock, translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry for his mother, the king broke out afresh, and made use of the most cruel and impolite expressions.",
  "This threat properly frightened King Grognio, and he apologised.",
  "For Celia has done nothing to deserve punishment.",
  "Is it not predicted in the Cord of the Venerable Knots that I shall slay this monster?",
  "The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him.",
  "What means this, gentlemen?",
  "At last, he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a distant city; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by himself.",
  "Why do you waste your pity on these princes, who love you so much that all their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you?",
  "I have hold of it now, cried the attorney.",
  "The Prince and Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor, and lived happily ever after.",
  "But Charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride, and the King, who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly, gave him letters to the Princess, and bade him good speed.",
  "The pleasant warmth of the air revived him, and he felt very hungry; but there seemed to be nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give him something to eat.",
  "But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table.",
  "He rose in a fury, and although it was not yet daylight, he sent for the Captain of his Bodyguard, and said to him: You have heard the Princess Miranda's dream?",
  "When people are as much in love with one another as you two are, they don't need advice from anyone else.",
  "-- of your royal Highness's courage and sordsmanship, I throw myself at your feet, and implore you to asist a prins in distres.",
  "Miranda was so surprised and confused by all that she had heard that she hardly knew what answer to give to the King of the Sheep, but she managed to make some kind of little speech, which certainly did not forbid him to hope, and said that she should not be afraid of the shadows now she knew that they would some day come to life again.",
  "The gardener, as you have heard already, had a son, who was a very handsome young man, with most agreeable manners, and every day he carried the best fruit of the garden to the King, and all the prettiest flowers to his daughter.",
  "She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it.",
  "So she remained, with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her white dress, wondering what the king intended to do, and whether it was something that Dick would not like.",
  "But they were not very, very far from land, and there was just enough strength left in the North Wind to enable him to throw her on to the shore, immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but then he was so weary and worn out that he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own home again.",
  "So the poor miller's daughter sat down, and did n't know what in the world she was to do.",
  "But the King replied: I have seen the whole castle, and shall find out what is in there; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open.",
  "As they began to be a little warm they heard three or four great raps at the door; this was the Ogre, who had come home.",
  "So the King, without losing a moment, set his foot upon it heavily.",
  "He sends you his glove, said Prince Prigio, as a challenge to mortal combat, till death do you part.",
  "And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood, and ate her all up.",
  "No, said the prince; no man can be in two different pairs of boots at one and the same time!",
  "If my mother only knew Her heart would surely break in two.",
  "But, being in the shop of the optician that day, standing with his back to the door, he heard Dick come in and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles, with which he was at once provided.",
  "They dared not go in, but sat themselves down at the door, listening to what their father and mother were saying.",
  "The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced; the birds fell down dead from the sky, slain by his frosty breath!",
  "she said in the kindest way.",
  "At last he came into a chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of which were all open, the finest sight was ever beheld -- a princess, who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and, in a manner, resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine.",
  "If he had been so lucky, he would now have got back to Gluckstein, and crossed the border with Lady Rosalind.",
  "The carpet was not the right magic carpet, but the one which King Prigio had put in its place.",
  "The youth went too on his way, and began to murmur to himself: Oh!",
  "Where is my palace and my daughter?",
  "History further relates that they lived very happy, had several children, and died at a good old age.",
  "Then they asked him why he had come; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness.",
  "I'll tell you what I'll do; I'll hand you over to a neighbour of mine, who is a bachelor.",
  "Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him?",
  "shouted the prince; for he knew that if the Remora won, it would be too cold for him to draw near the place, and cut off the Firedrake's head and tail.",
  "The people, glad to see him again, received him with acclamations of joy, and followed him in crowds to the Sultan's apartment.",
  "Now, in Manoa, where all the firm foundations of the city had trembled once, when the sun just touched the Earthquaker, the people, seeing that the shadow of the sacred column had crept to its foot, and yet Manoa stood firm again, and the Temple of the Sun was not overthrown, raised such a cry that it echoed even through the halls within the hollow hill.",
  "There is some dreadful mistake, sir, said Prigio to the king.",
  "Not so, replied Aladdin, but a wicked magician, and told her of how she had been deceived.",
  "He asked her whither she was going.",
  "Look at him with that when he is asleep, but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him.",
  "But he is my prime minister's son!",
  "They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most ingenious people, they slung up one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top.",
  "She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.",
  "I say, said Dick, who was seldom at all up to the standard of royal conversation, what's that game you were playing?",
  "Perhaps fortune, to make me amends for depriving me of what I thought the greatest happiness, may have reserved a greater blessing for my comfort.",
  "The city walls were built of huge square stones, and among the groves towered pyramids, on which the people did service to their gods.",
  "I had sent so many petitions for my liberty that his Majesty at length mentioned the matter in a full council, where it was opposed by none except Skyresh Bolgolam, admiral of the realm, who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy.",
  "For here the prince learned that there is a very rare beast called a Remora, which is at least as cold as the Firedrake is hot!",
  "He gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him, until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer.",
  "They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf, but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more, and beg as prettily as they could, on behalf of the King, that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about.",
  "It would have saved a great deal of trouble; but I am so much out of the habit of using the cap, that I never thought of it.",
  "He clapped his hands, the Grand Vizier appeared, and the king gave orders to have the Flying Horse saddled at once.",
  "The little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the King, but he repented his promise, and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero.",
  "The shops were all of a size, and all that dealt in the same sort of goods lived in one street; as also the handicrafts-men, who kept their shops in the smaller streets.",
  "Now you must throw out the lump of salt, said the Master-maid, and the Prince did so, and it grew up into such a great high mountain right across the sea that the giant could not come over it, and the river-sucker could not drink any more water.",
  "It was the first time he had forgotten his grammar, but he was terribly excited.",
  "But at last they told him to keep always south, and with the land on his left and the sea on his right, till he reached the Island of the Fairies of the Garden.",
  "We must not waste time in talking, said she.",
  "The Queen petted and took care of him, but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she consulted the court physician, who said that he was to be fed only upon bread, and was not to have much even of that.",
  "Then his Majesty lit a cigar and took up a volume; he certainly was a sad bookworm.",
  "She guessed what it was, though the prince had said nothing about it at dinner.",
  "Then the prince built up a heap of straw, with wood on it, and there he laid poor puss, and set fire to the pile.",
  "When the ambassador reached the city, where the King was waiting impatiently, everybody was very much annoyed with him for not bringing the Princess, and the King cried like a baby, and nobody could console him.",
  "I tell my father everything; but then, I never had anything like this to tell him before.",
  "Then he drew the sword of sharpness, and with one turn of his wrist cut the cat's head clean off.",
  "So, when dinner-time drew near, he set the mill on the kitchen-table, and said: Grind herrings and milk pottage, and do it both quickly and well.",
  "I condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated.",
  "When they had gone a great part of the way, the White Bear said: Are you afraid?",
  "Now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married.",
  "This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, Thou wishest thou couldst go to the ball; is it not so?",
  "On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground.",
  "With any blade, said Prince Charles, I shall be happy to find Prince Ricardo by my side in a stricken field.",
  "He therefore took the crier with him to the khan where he lodged, and counted him out the money, and received the perspective glass.",
  "He went immediately to the Ogre's house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre's murdered daughters.",
  "We can't get over, said Hansel; I see no bridge of any sort or kind.",
  "She held a new council, calling in mice from every quarter of the globe, but nobody knew where the bronze ring was.",
  "Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave the magician plenty of time.",
  "But the Sultan was not yet satisfied.",
  "Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other.",
  "We must think of something to say, said Jaqueline.",
  "He determined to get hold of the lamp, and again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.",
  "May I ask what you are doing here, and how you came?",
  "I pray for their conversion daily, said the Duke of York.",
  "And, as you know I am very curious, and delight in everything that's singular, I promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most extraordinary rarity; and for the purchase of the rarity you shall go in search after, and the expense of traveling, I will give you every one a sum of money.",
  "That is nothing, said the prince; but, my dear Lord Kelso, may I not have the pleasure of presenting Lady Rosalind with a little gift, a Philippine which I lost to her last night, merely the head and tail of a Firedrake which I stalked this morning?",
  "When the tent was set up in the great plain, which we have before mentioned, he found it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field.",
  "Well to be sure, he is an easy master!",
  "He was a fine fellow, said the brothers, and the Princess threw the second golden apple to him!",
  "She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see anything plainly, because the windows were shut.",
  "I'll be into you, pretty quick, said Ricardo.",
  "Nay, she is somewhere in the unknown centre of South America, said his Majesty; somewhere behind Mount Roraima, where nobody has ever been.",
  "what hope can there be for an unhappy sheep like myself?",
  "Snow-white was quite sad over their friend's departure, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it, but she could n't be certain of it; and the bear ran hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.",
  "After choosing a vast quantity, which she divided between her sisters -- for she had made a heap of the wonderful dresses for each of them -- she opened the last chest, which was full of gold.",
  "And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements -- indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be.",
  "The malicious Dwarf looked at her and began to laugh spitefully.",
  "Yes, said the North Wind, I know where it is.",
  "It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth; and he knew the prince at once, and rubbed himself against him and purred.",
  "A pair were thrown up by a volcano, in my great-grandfather's time Giglio I. * Excellent coffee this, of yours!",
  "Oh, he wo n't mind this time!",
  "Then the boy rode this horse, too, away to the place where he kept the other, and then went home again.",
  "Then the Firedrake dived back, with an awful splash of flame, and the mountain roared round him.",
  "Every man has one secret from his wife, and this shall be mine.",
  "There must be some mystery in this, said he to himself again, and it may be advantageous to me.",
  "I am the Fairy of the Desert; without the Yellow Dwarf and his orange tree my great lions would soon have eaten you up, I can tell you, and in Fairyland we do not suffer ourselves to be insulted like this.",
  "cried the Princess, starting back a little.",
  "He was very much surprised, and sat down in a corner of his room feeling quite ashamed of himself.",
  "But the bed was too big for the little tailor, so he did n't get into it, but crept away into the corner.",
  "Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his mother.",
  "Willingly, said the tailor; that's mere child's play.",
  "Never mind, she answered, it's just as well to try and deserve it.",
  "Yet one or the other choice seemed certain.",
  "Everyone wept bitterly -- everyone but Prince Prigio; for he thought it was a practical joke, and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world.",
  "How can I go to the King, said the gardener, a poor wretch like me?",
  "They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them.",
  "Many of them wore golden collars with jewels, flowers, and ribbons.",
  "Look here, young Blinkers, I don't want to hurt you.",
  "So home he went, and happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance.",
  "Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats.",
  "He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him: Why need you do it now?",
  "Or, when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made one's flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: Oh!",
  "The room was very dark; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window, one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times.",
  "Cinderlad, however, did not trouble himself about what they said, but when evening drew near rambled away to the outlying field.",
  "Manoa, whose golden spires and pinnacles are shining below us, is the City of the Sun, which Sir Walter Raleigh and the Spaniards could never find, so that men have doubted of its existence.",
  "They saw the ships move forward in a large half-moon, but could not discern me, who, in the middle of the channel, was under water up to my neck.",
  "For the lot fell on the daughter of thy servant the Inca, and he refuses to give her up.",
  "here's Dick coming out of his enormous mouth, all in armour set with sharp spikes, and a sword in his hand.",
  "Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace.",
  "I am, sir, replied Aladdin; but he died a long while ago.",
  "The Princess was greatly astonished at the hen's story, and said kindly: I am truly sorry for you, my poor nurse, and wish it was in my power to restore you to your real form.",
  "I fear I am fated to be unhappy for many a long day still.",
  "I might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work.",
  "my children, how I wish Mr. Arrowsmith would do as much for me!",
  "After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself; but she could not, she was so much frightened.",
  "You must kill them and then burn them separately, and gather up the ashes.",
  "Then Prigio, seeing a little heap of grey ashes beside the engine, watered them with the fairy water; and up jumped Alphonso, as jolly as ever, his sword in his hand.",
  "Charming was only too glad to give her the flask, and she flitted into the cavern quite unnoticed by the dragon, and after some time returned with the flask, filled to the very brim with sparkling water.",
  "cried poor Molinda, kneeling at the throne, where her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture.",
  "A ten days ' feast was proclaimed, and it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace; but it was not to be.",
  "So I suppose the rest of the butler's tale is true, which I regret; but a king's word is sacred, and he shall take the place of that sneak, Prigio.",
  "Just wait till I spot the places.",
  "When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality, precious stones.",
  "These were marks of encounters, in which he had been cut to bits and come together again; for this was his peculiarity, which made him so dangerous.",
  "One knight presented himself after the other, and none could show the apple.",
  "He was greatly astonished, sprang from his horse, and looked everywhere to see if no one were hidden under the bridge; but no one was there.",
  "That is true, said the Ogre; give them their belly full that they may not fall away, and put them to bed.",
  "So she was delighted when she heard this, almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure.",
  "They found a great deal to say to each other, and at last the prince asked her to be his wife; and she said that if the king and her father gave their permission -- why, then she would!",
  "But where on earth can he be?",
  "You are the best girl in the world, Jaqueline, said Ricardo.",
  "I have a fine shirt which I want to wear as my wedding shirt, but three drops of tallow have got upon it which I want to have washed off, and I have vowed to marry no one but the woman who is able to do it.",
  "They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him.",
  "When the news came to the ears of the real Princess she went to the slaughterer, and secretly promised him a piece of gold if he would do something for her.",
  "Prettier than ever, said Prigio; but anxious about you.",
  "There, as my father now and then sent me small sums of money, I spent them in learning navigation, and other arts useful to those who travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do.",
  "said the Prince; yesterday my master talked about this Master-maid, and to-day he is talking about her again, and the first day of all it was talk of the same kind.",
  "At last the port was reached.",
  "She went and said to the magician: Give me a new lamp for this.",
  "cried the prince: his legs are giving way; he's groggy on his pins!",
  "I played ninepins, he answered, and lost a few pence.",
  "Lend thy aid ` gainst her who sinned!",
  "No, it is mine, cried the lame one, for I ran off with the ring.",
  "His Majesty, with the royal family and great officers of the Court, came out to receive me, and they entertained me in a manner suited to the generosity of so great a prince.",
  "The horse in its fright suddenly reared, and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below.",
  "` For five years, ' she said, ` you shall be a sheep, and lord of this pleasant land, while I, no longer able to see your face, which I loved so much, shall be better able to hate you as you deserve to be hated.",
  "If there are any means, I beg you will tell them, and let me come off with honor this time.",
  "With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one.",
  "And now, sire, said the young captain, do you not recognize me?",
  "Now in the outskirts of the capital there lived an old man, who had spent his life in studying black arts -- alchemy, astrology, magic, and enchantment.",
  "The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, the Princess on one side of him and the waiting-maid on the other; but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments.",
  "Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, arrived at Bisnagar, the capital of the kingdom of that name, and the residence of its king.",
  "Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake.",
  "But the youngest slept between her two sisters, and she lay on her back, with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky; and though she slept her eyes were wide open.",
  "But he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind, and, disappointed, rode home.",
  "The king drew a long breath.",
  "Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful, her dark hair as dark, and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing, as on the day when she was a bride.",
  "In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba's son.",
  "When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life.",
  "Prince Ali, Prince Houssain's second brother, who designed to travel into Persia, took the road, having three days after he parted with his brothers joined a caravan, and after four days ' travel arrived at Schiraz, which was the capital of the kingdom of Persia.",
  "Now, said she, I have time to tell you about the Princess.",
  "master, I thank you -- but you are only mocking me, said the King's son.",
  "I picked the monster up early in the morning, he said, through the magic telescope, father.",
  "And you have saved the Hope of Pantouflia, not once or twice, said his Majesty, grandly.",
  "We would slay him and her, answered the priest; for, when the shadow shrinks to the foot of the stone, the sun will shine straight down into the hollow hill of the Earthquaker, and he will waken and destroy Manoa and the Temples of the Sun.",
  "He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death.",
  "Bellissima is pretty enough, but I don't particularly want to marry her -- you can keep her.",
  "Listen to me; though I don't know anything more about you, I am willing to help you.",
  "But the Firedrake, too, was in an unhappy way; for his legs were now cold and black, his horns were black also, though his body, especially near the heart, glowed still like red-hot iron.",
  "Roughly clothed, and living in the simplest way, the girls regretted unceasingly the luxuries and amusements of their former life; only the youngest tried to be brave and cheerful.",
  "Indeed, it is not so easy to deceive the king.",
  "He therefore drew bridle, placed his rose-coloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse, for the yellow light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly.",
  "In the meantime the two women carried the magician into a very fine apartment, richly furnished.",
  "said he; then he saw an owl sitting in a hollow tree, who said to him: You saved my life when I was caught in the net, now I can repay you.",
  "The Prophecy is fulfilled, said the Inca, and wept for joy.",
  "Well, said her godmother, be but a good girl, and I will contrive that thou shalt go.",
  "But when they came before him they found he had been informed of their arrival by the chief of the Princess's eunuchs, and by what means the Princess had been perfectly cured.",
  "The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to lose them again; and, that they might be the surer of doing it, to carry them to a much greater distance than before.",
  "Then he drew the sword of sharpness, and with one turn of his wrist cut the cat's head clean off.",
  "Secondly: By attending an unseemly revel in the town of Gluckstein, where he brawled in the streets.",
  "He saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood, and he too went into it to see who lived there, and when he entered and saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than the sheriff had done, and began to woo her at once.",
  "Then there was an aviary full of rare birds, which were so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and her head.",
  "The other lady was as dark as night -- dark eyes, dark hair; her crown was of poppies.",
  "No, said the king; I think mine is the best plan.",
  "Next Thursday evening the White Bear came to fetch her.",
  "Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly.",
  "For the king disliked him as much as ever, and was as angry as ever about the deaths of Enrico and Alphonso.",
  "She's only a miller's daughter, it's true, he thought; but I could n't find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.",
  "No, no, said he, recommend thyself to God, and was just ready to strike... At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop.",
  "Charming took the ring out of Dame Carp's mouth, thanking her a thousand times, and he and tiny Frisk went straight to the palace, where someone told the Princess that he was asking to see her.",
  "As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all.",
  "Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he came; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb; the birds had come and had eaten it up, every bit.",
  "Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry.",
  "I told you not to trust to these things, said the king.",
  "'' In one moment there he was in white and gold, the greatest and most magnificent dandy in the whole world, and the handsomest man!",
  "He begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc's egg hanging from the dome.",
  "From behind the door, said he who owned the mill, for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but later in the evening, when he had taken a drop too much, he could not refrain from telling how he had come by the hand-mill.",
  "Bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook, leaning her head upon her hand and weeping bitterly, but just as they passed she looked up and saw the King and the Fairy of the Desert.",
  "Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife.",
  "-- here she held out her own, which were very white, round and pretty: for Molinda was a good-hearted girl, she could not bear to see Prigio put to death; and then, perhaps, she reflected that there are worse positions than the queenship of Pantouflia.",
  "said the Prince Surely you would not care?",
  "Why do you bother a fellow so?",
  "However, I noticed that one of my companions in misfortune was also very attentive to this little sprite, and I found out that he had been her lover, whom the cruel Ragotte had taken away from her long before; since then I have cared for, and thought of, nothing but how I might regain my freedom.",
  "Then promise me when you are Queen to give me your first child.",
  "The queen accompanied him, remarking that she was sound asleep, but would waken presently.",
  "Carry with thee this magic ball.",
  "Fear nothing, Princess, said the Captain of the Guard.",
  "Oh, Ricardo, how you do neglect your Heraldry!",
  "FELICIA AND THE POT OF PINKS Once upon a time there was a poor laborer who, feeling that he had not much longer to live, wished to divide his possessions between his son and daughter, whom he loved dearly.",
  "Not knowing what to do, she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal, and then remembered that in the King's room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape, also filled with sparkling water.",
  "Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite aloud: Oh!",
  "Was Mr. Benson equally ready?",
  "Up flew the horse with an easy action, and the king's head nearly swam with the swiftness of the flight.",
  "Then they stretched out their claws.",
  "no, Beast, said Beauty hastily.",
  "Then she changed herself into a mosquito -- a kind of gnat that bites -- and hid herself under a fold of Dick's coat.",
  "But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his magic arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing miserably in the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he was living in great honor and wealth.",
  "Follow it, and when it stops, as the gates will be open, you will see the four lions: the two that are awake will, by their roaring, wake the other two, but don't be frightened, but throw each of them a quarter of mutton, and then clap spurs to your horse and ride to the fountain; fill your bottle without alighting, and then return with the same expedition.",
  "The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as any spindle in their houses.",
  "Then, putting a golden crown upon his head, and the royal mantle upon his shoulders, she said: Come, faithful Charming, I make you king, and will take you for my husband.",
  "She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company, she went down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.",
  "Why, it may be the sun next!",
  "The current carried them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash.",
  "The girl said what she had said on each of the former occasions -- that it was not for sale either for gold or for money, but if she could get leave to go to the Prince who lived there, and be with him during the night, she should have it.",
  "His Majesty rose, and walked to the crystal globe, which was in a stand, like other globes.",
  "Heavier than lead, said the king.",
  "how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.",
  "Now Green Stocking was the chief herald of Pantouflia, just like Blue Mantle in England.",
  "You will find several of them will tell you they had not been alive this day if they had not made use of this excellent remedy.",
  "I took nine sticks, and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square.",
  "It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw, and I 've seen a good many.",
  "and Rosalind said, Yes; quite.",
  "and to clap his hands, whereon all the courtiers shouted and threw up their hats.",
  "If she can not do that, she is not worth having.",
  "After they were read I was requested to swear to perform them in the method prescribed by their laws, which was to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the top of my right ear.",
  "At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and began also to scold at the poor boy, bidding him to go to work.",
  "On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying, I am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to my brother.",
  "Cinderlad wanted to go with them to look at the riding, but the two brothers would not have him in their company, and when they got to the glass hill there was no one who could ride even so far as a yard up it, and everyone waited for the knight in silver armor, but he was neither to be seen nor heard of.",
  "In his distress he asked charity of several people, and one of them bid him Go to work for an idle rogue.",
  "The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world.",
  "So he sent for a female magician, who was introduced by a back door into his apartment.",
  "The merchant accepted this proposal, though he did not really think any of his daughters could be persuaded to come.",
  "But, Dick, it is your father's rule that you are never to meddle in the affairs of other countries, and never to start on an expedition when he is not at home.",
  "Approach, lovely Princess, he cried; have no fear of such gentle and peaceable animals as we are.",
  "But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste any more time in thinking, but went to seek the Princess, who very soon consented to marry him.",
  "She was tall, with cheeks like white roses blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face was the kindest in the world!",
  "But the prince did not like the tone of her voice, and he said: No, there's something; do tell me what it is.",
  "The boat reached the island, and the mice landed.",
  "When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself, the giant said: What!",
  "Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and asked what was the matter.",
  "cried Blue Beard One moment longer, said his wife, and then she cried out: Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?",
  "She soon seemed to be quite well again, and the Prince, delighted to have been able to help her, was thinking of going home to the palace, when he heard a great outcry, and, turning round, saw Celia, who was being carried against her will into the great house.",
  "At last the chief men of the kingdom, anxious to see their Princess married, sent to the Queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as soon as possible.",
  "And then her dreams changed, but the charming Prince figured in them all; and when morning came her first thought was to look at the portrait, and see if it was really like him, and she found that it certainly was.",
  "I run to the door, and there he was, flying right hover the town, in a northerly direction.",
  "Tell him that I await his answer.",
  "THE YELLOW DWARF Once upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great many children, and of them all only one daughter was left.",
  "Besides, Jaqueline had been lectured herself lately, and had not enjoyed it.",
  "Most certainly, said the little tailor: just you take the trunk on your shoulder; I'll bear the top and branches, which is certainly the heaviest part.",
  "she cried in terror, I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!",
  "Be quick and give me my blue satin embroidered dress, and comb out my golden hair.",
  "But somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her, and she was forced to tell the whole story.",
  "Charming was thinking sadly of having to go back unsuccessful when he heard someone calling: Charming, Charming!",
  "they said; it is our duty to guard this place, and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you and to us.",
  "The king at once held a Court; the horns and tail of the monster were exhibited amidst general interest, and Benson and the prince were invited to state their claims.",
  "Now I 've caught my bird, said the tailor, and he came out from behind the tree, placed the cord round its neck first, then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe, and when everything was in order led the beast before the King.",
  "Now the old woman, who was out spreading the hay, began to think dinner was long in coming, and said to the women and the mowers: Though the master does not call us home, we may as well go.",
  "I was caught; in a few minutes the fowlers would have been here -- without your help I should have been killed.",
  "That morning the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced to endure once a day.",
  "Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise.",
  "So the other trolls had to come and wash, but, the more they did, the blacker and uglier grew the shirt, until at length it was as black as if it had been up the chimney.",
  "The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats between her teeth.",
  "I came up with her between five and six in the evening, Sept. 26, 1701; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors.",
  "When they had seated themselves at the table the Prince who had been in service with the giant said that he thought they ought to have invited the maiden who had lent them the shovel-handle, and the porch-door, and the calf up to the palace, for, said he, if we had not got these three things, we should never have got away from the palace.",
  "Certainly, madam, said Prigio; and I said so, too.",
  "The landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: If that's what you 're sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here.",
  "When she saw the unlucky cabbage Felicia was much distressed, and did not know what to do; but at last she ran back to the fountain, and, kneeling before the Queen, said: Madam, Bruno has stolen my pot of pinks, so I have nothing but my silver ring; but I beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude.",
  "Well, well, then I will go all alone by myself, said Cinderlad.",
  "When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them.",
  "So the Master-maid took a knife, and cut the Prince's little finger, and dropped three drops of blood upon a wooden stool; then she took all the old rags, and shoe-soles, and all the rubbish she could lay hands on, and put them in the cauldron; and then she filled a chest with gold dust, and a lump of salt, and a water-flask which was hanging by the door, and she also took with her a golden apple, and two gold chickens; and then she and the Prince went away with all the speed they could, and when they had gone a little way they came to the sea, and then they sailed, but where they got the ship from I have never been able to learn.",
  "Her father still tried to persuade her to go back, but in vain.",
  "He was greatly astonished when he saw the gold hut shining and glittering there in the copse, and he was still more astonished when he went in and caught sight of the beautiful young maiden who was sitting there; he fell in love with her at once, and straightway on the spot he begged her, both prettily and kindly, to marry him.",
  "Aladdin fearlessly replied: Deliver me from this place!",
  "At the same instant he found himself in a great forest, beside a clear lake, in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become, and a voice said to him: Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you; believe me, your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body.",
  "But look as he would, he saw no monsters preying on human-kind anywhere, nor princesses in distress.",
  "By her side lay the self-same bundle of rags which she had brought with her from her own home.",
  "But no one appeared, and even after another long sleep, from which he awoke completely refreshed, there was no sign of anybody, though a fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table at his elbow.",
  "He sent to the tailor and told him that, seeing what a great and warlike hero he was, he was about to make him an offer.",
  "What is all this, Carluccio?",
  "Prins, you may be less well informed about my situation.",
  "Wait my coming, my cousin, said Prigio to the Inca; I shall bring you back the daughter that was lost, when I have slain your enemy.",
  "he shouted, as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth.",
  "When he had done this and again looked around, the two pieces had united, and a horrible-looking man sat on his seat.",
  "I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation, and yet see what a degrading occupation I am reduced to.",
  "The prince just took time to shout, The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit!",
  "I knew his heart, and am certain that if it had not been for the bad influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and a father to his people.",
  "It is some of this water that I really must have: everything it touches becomes wonderful.",
  "On seeing this, Semiramis began to growl, as cats do when they are angry, and slowly approached his Majesty.",
  "The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced; the birds fell down dead from the sky, slain by his frosty breath!",
  "Who was glad to see the prince, if it was not Lady Rosalind?",
  "she ran into her son's very arms, but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her, when the King struck at him with his sword.",
  "The butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda; because, as he justly remarked to William, here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again.",
  "Then the King spoke: You have freed the castle from its curse, and you shall marry my daughter.",
  "They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near.",
  "The king, Benson, and the prince were not so particular, and they simply flew back to Falkenstein in the usual way, arriving there at 11.35 -- a week before her majesty.",
  "The King of the Gold Mines was quite overcome by the Princess's good-natured way of taking his interference, and, throwing himself at her feet, he kissed her hand a thousand times and begged her to forgive him.",
  "The king was out at a council meeting; knowing that Ricardo had the right things, all in good order, he was not in the least anxious about him.",
  "The astronomers of Pantouflia, who conceived that they knew a great deal, had certainly been taken by surprise this time.",
  "Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother, and wanted to marry her, but he knew that she would never part from her boy.",
  "Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way, which she traced till she came to the farther end, looking carefully about on all sides; but, notwithstanding all her diligence, could perceive no opening, not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered, which was to be seen and opened to none but men, and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou.",
  "They found a great deal to say to each other, and at last the prince asked her to be his wife; and she said that if the king and her father gave their permission -- why, then she would!",
  "'\nBut that's just one of the things I object to most in Dick.",
  "my Queen, replied Prince Ahmed, do you say Schaibar is your brother?",
  "Now this was very difficult to do, as she was guarded by some terrible lions; but happily the Queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of millet flour, sugar-candy, and crocodile's eggs.",
  "In that book, Prince Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered, and that would be of use to him.",
  "The distressed wife came down, and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders.",
  "Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: That'll be a dainty bite.",
  "These grave dancing fairies were very unlike the Grey Women, and they were glad to see the boy, and treated him kindly.",
  "Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes, she said to her: Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!",
  "she cried, what can they be?",
  "But they were all eager to win the King's daughter and half the kingdom, so they rode and they slipped, and thus it went on.",
  "On the contrary quite, there is only too much of it.",
  "Don't know him, grunted the Firedrake.",
  "Then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her eye, and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it held a portrait of her unknown admirer, just as she had seen him in her dream.",
  "So the boy put the cap on his head, and hung the wallet round his waist, and the shining shield on his shoulders, and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world.",
  "But the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible.",
  "you dear children, who led you here?",
  "They were a weary weight to carry; but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle, where he threw down his burden, and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue.",
  "Where are you going at this late hour?",
  "When Pretty Goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the King's feet and begged him to set Charming free, but the more she cried, the more angry he was, and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more; but it made her very sad.",
  "The Prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at once, and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was away.",
  "It was something like this, in English: Oh Lady Moon, on the waters riding, On shining waters, in silver sheen, Show me the secret the heart is hiding, Show me the truth of the thought, oh Queen!",
  "But the youth carefully watched his opportunity, and just as it was rushing at him with open jaws he threw the bit straight into its mouth, and the horse stood as quiet as a young lamb, and there was no difficulty at all in getting it home to the stable.",
  "He at once rode to the hut, and found the two maidens at the fountain.",
  "Ought I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?",
  "They were so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads.",
  "Some were abroad; several were ill; a few were in prison among the Saracens; others were captives in the dens of ogres.",
  "The family gibbet, I presume, is in good working order?",
  "I attempted to rise, but could not; for as I happened to be lying on my back, I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.",
  "A monarch has not a moment to himself for his private studies.",
  "said Prince Prigio, no cat since the time of Puss in Boots was ever so well taken care of as you shall be.",
  "On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern.",
  "The king consulted the learned men about the Court, who told him that probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood.",
  "Have you lost the eye, sister?",
  "They were like three very beautiful young women, dressed one in green, one in white, and one in red, and they were dancing and singing round an apple tree with apples of gold, and this was their song: THE SONG OF THE WESTERN FAIRIES Round and round the apples of gold, Round and round dance we; Thus do we dance from the days of old About the enchanted tree; Round, and round, and round we go, While the spring is green, or the stream shall flow, Or the wind shall stir the sea!",
  "Once home, he said to the genie: Build me a palace of the finest marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones.",
  "She then confessed all, bidding him to ask the Vizier's son if it were not so.",
  "madam, she answered simply, if I have your friendship I shall do very well.",
  "Just the tip of his nose, as white as snow and as smooth as ice, was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain, not far from the burning mountain of the Firedrake.",
  "The prince, very much surprised, parried in prime, riposted, and touched Dick on the hand.",
  "She just caught his tail feather.",
  "The man's heart smote him heavily, and he thought: Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one's children!",
  "I am spinning, my pretty child, said the old woman, who did not know who she was.",
  "he said in a hoarse, angry voice.",
  "Then the youth said: Now, my little cousin, what would have happened if I had n't warmed you?",
  "They all knelt down, humbly imploring his compassion.",
  "On the third day everything went just as on the former days.",
  "Besides, said this kind young lady, I hear he is extremely handsome, and very brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed first in everything.",
  "Now the water in this flask was what was used in the kingdom for getting rid of troublesome people.",
  "He also built Newgate for criminals, and gave liberally to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and other public charities.",
  "And when the sentence had been carried out the young King was married to his real bride, and both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness.",
  "Do you know that you are a dwarf -- that you are so ugly that one can not bear to look at you -- and that I should have killed you myself long before this if you had been worthy of such a glorious death?",
  "But in this, it soon appeared, I was deceived.",
  "With these thistles and nettles she can feed a donkey which she can ride whenever she likes; under this humble roof no weather can hurt her; she will drink the water of this brook and eat frogs -- which grow very fat about here; and then she will have me always with her, handsome, agreeable, and gay as you see me now.",
  "Leaping with his Spanish cat upon the balcony, he snatched Bellissima from the Queen's arms, and before any of the ladies of the Court could stop him he had sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize.",
  "Enrico tried to improve it, but could not.",
  "The youth heard this, got up, and said: It's not come to that yet.",
  "So in the evening, when the giant came home with the goats, the Prince went into the chamber and hummed and sang again as he had done on the other two evenings.",
  "The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician's conduct, and said to her: Do you as you think fit; I'll wait patiently the event of your promises, and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value.",
  "However, Paribanou saved her the trouble, and said to her: Good woman, I am glad I had an opportunity to oblige you, and to see you are able to pursue your journey.",
  "Then the flat, white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped, and slowly, like the movement of a sheet of ice, it slipped upwards and curled upwards, and up, and up!",
  "Is life, then, so worthless?",
  "So he ran toward the wood, but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears, and the hunters, who were hiding in a tree, leaped down, and secured him with several chains, and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom.",
  "Beside the dead body of the Firedrake!",
  "On the 5th of November, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it, and immediately split.",
  "That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again.",
  "They both lay down to sleep again, and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant, who sprang up and cried: What's that for?",
  "Then the old King said: Now I die comforted and in peace; and then he went on: After my death you must show him the whole castle, all the rooms and apartments and vaults, and all the treasures that lie in them; but you must not show him the last room in the long passage, where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof is hidden.",
  "As she drank she murmured: Oh!",
  "Is it by your orders that I am here?",
  "I 'm just on my way there.",
  "And so the sexton took him into his house, and his duty was to toll the bell.",
  "Below them flowed the clear, green water of the Gluckthal And still nobody said a word.",
  "They were all three beautiful, but the youngest was the fairest.",
  "I beg your pardon, I never noticed; I 'm sure I am very sorry, cried the prince, who, never having been in love himself, never thought of other people.",
  "Trusty John lifted him up, carried him to bed, and thought sorrowfully: The curse has come upon us; gracious heaven!",
  "Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull, knee-deep in snow; and still the Remora climbed and climbed.",
  "The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature.",
  "Just try to take it off, and you will soon find out that I am more powerful than you are!",
  "He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone.",
  "This path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers.",
  "This was what was written on the plates: AQVA.",
  "And though it was believed that he shot the farthest, and that he therefore deserved the Princess Nouronnihar, it was, however, necessary that his arrow should be found to make the matter more evident and certain; and, notwithstanding his remonstrance, the Sultan judged in favor of Prince Ali, and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding, which was celebrated a few days after with great magnificence.",
  "The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but she said what the first old woman had said: I know nothing about it, but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get there at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me: perhaps she may know where the castle is, and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again.",
  "After they had ridden for about an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her waiting-maid: Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream: I would like a drink.",
  "Well, you 're a fine fellow, after all, said the giant; come and spend the night with us in our cave.",
  "After that she tried the other seven windows in turn, and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them, so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more.",
  "Here he put on the wishing-cap; wished for a pint of champagne, a hot bath, and his best black velvet and diamond suit.",
  "But my good master Bates died two years after; and as I had few friends my business began to fail, and I determined to go again to sea.",
  "The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears.",
  "Now, Dick, like a good fellow, and to please me, work hard all to-morrow till the afternoon.",
  "But the prince did not like the tone of her voice, and he said: No, there's something; do tell me what it is.",
  "Prince Houssain would not honor the feast with his presence.",
  "As for the king, he was only anxious to get back to Falkenstein, and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner.",
  "If you are anxious about him, why don't you look for him in the magic crystal?",
  "Fear nothing, sleep peacefully, and before long you shall see your father once more.",
  "And so it went on for eight days, till the King began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver -- it was never still for a moment.",
  "As soon as Dame Carp felt the refreshing coolness of the water she sank down joyfully to the bottom of the river, then, swimming up to the bank quite boldly, she said: I thank you, Charming, for the kindness you have done me.",
  "So she went away, and when she had walked a short distance she came to a little hut which stood all alone in a small wood, hard by the King's palace.",
  "No, you had gone to bed before it happened.",
  "Did I say that you were not to go to the wedding?",
  "The King was just thinking that he would cause it to be proclaimed that the riding should begin afresh on the following day, when perhaps it might go better, when suddenly a knight came riding up on so fine a horse that no one had ever seen the like of it before, and the knight had armor of copper, and his bridle was of copper too, and all his accoutrements were so bright that they shone again.",
  "Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber.",
  "And, big and fat as he was, he went out as briskly as a boy.",
  "These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that the king, unable to answer them, withdrew into a solitary place where he could express himself with freedom, and give rein to his passions.",
  "Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken's hat far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks, and he could n't get any hair; so they watched the geese till it was dark.",
  "But the flies, who did n't understand English, refused to let themselves be warned off, and returned again in even greater numbers.",
  "II When Prince Ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow, which he gathered up, looked earnestly at it, and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away.",
  "A brace of oxen, a drove of sheep or two, are enough for me, the Giant went on complacently, but forgetting to mention that the sheep and the oxen were the property of other people.",
  "At last the wind wizard's son said to the King: Send for the old wizard from Finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together.",
  "The king groped about everywhere, like a blind man, and at last discovered the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the sofa.",
  "He looked at her reproachfully, and said: How can you ask me, cruel one?",
  "Beautiful Princess, cried the Dwarf suddenly, throwing himself on his knees before her, I flatter myself that you will not be displeased at her choice when I tell you that it is to me she has promised the happiness of marrying you.",
  "Only a good man can be really contented.",
  "If you were clever enough to kill the creature -- and I admit that -- you were clever enough to know that what everybody said must be true.",
  "The girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist, and there she hung, as if she were dead.",
  "He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death.",
  "I had a letter from you this morning, and I believe you wanted to see me.",
  "Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle, where nobody went for fear of ghosts, ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein.",
  "As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued, and, in short, showed the best military discipline I ever beheld.",
  "That I expect, said Cassim; but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all.",
  "His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me, and I answered; but neither of us could understand a word.",
  "Par Madame la Comtesse d'Aulnoy.",
  "What good would it do him to be rich, or handsome, or to possess all the kingdoms of the world if he were wicked?",
  "and he scrambled out, all red-hot as he was.",
  "The thing is, of course, he said, to destroy the Earthquaker before he wakens; but how?",
  "It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed.",
  "she asked herself, as she stood at the window watching the moon.",
  "Prince Ricardo and an Old Enemy.",
  "You have waited a long while.",
  "And thou, O raging, stormy Sea, Stirred by wild winds, from depth to height, Thou hold ` st my loved one far from me, And I am captive to thy might.",
  "So they began to straggle homeward, but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread, all pouring forth and winding about one over the other, and the man himself in front of the flood.",
  "She took him by the hand and let him into the palace, for she was the lady's maid.",
  "As he pricked on, his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose.",
  "The King of the Gold Mines, indignant at being kept from his happiness by this wicked old woman, went up to her, and threatening her with his sword, said: Get away out of my country at once, and for ever, miserable creature, lest I take your life, and so rid myself of your malice.",
  "Then the boy answered that he was not afraid, if only he knew the way.",
  "Nay, he was even more angry; and, perhaps, not without reason.",
  "See what happens when people do not keep their promises!",
  "There he was in a moment; and dreadful the body looked, lying stark and cold in the white moonshine.",
  "The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants.",
  "When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier.",
  "I was passing through the wood when you were out hunting, and I wished to find out if you were really good, as everybody said you were, so I took the shape of a little rabbit and came to your arms for shelter, for I know that those who are merciful to animals will be still kinder to their fellow-men.",
  "And, Rosina, you may keep the silver drops for yourself.",
  "Now Mr. Belsham was his tutor, from Oxford.",
  "When he was quite ready -- and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer's foot -- the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats.",
  "What misfortune has brought you to this dismal place?",
  "Then the boy slipped from behind them out of the cold cave into the air, and he laughed aloud.",
  "Then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been, and going forward he opened the cupboard, and fetched the two children and Trusty John out, saying: God be praised!",
  "So the King sent messengers to every town, village, and hamlet in his dominions, to look for a gardener whose forefathers had been gardeners also, and after forty days one was found.",
  "Having heard -- as who has not?",
  "When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: I 've got them now; they sha 'n' t escape me.",
  "I did n't strike you, said the other, you must be dreaming.",
  "you have come, you have come; I knew you would come!",
  "Can we get anything to eat here?",
  "Only say good-by to all your brothers and sisters the night before you come away, and when you have gone to bed turn this ring round upon your finger and say firmly: ' I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again.",
  "I 've not been to England at all.",
  "Then he followed her through the field, and hid himself behind a bush on the common.",
  "A million of money may not seem much, but a pair of young people who really love each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his pocket.",
  "She had saved Dick, but at an enormous sacrifice, for the sword and the Seven - league Boots were lying on the trampled grass.",
  "The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine.",
  "It is sufficient for us that they are the words of Mr. Fitzwarren; and though it is beside our purpose, and perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet, we shall soon convince the reader that he was a good man, which was a much better character; for when some who were present told him that this treasure was too much for such a poor boy as Whittington, he said: God forbid that I should deprive him of a penny; it is his own, and he shall have it to a farthing.",
  "But what was the king to say in reply?",
  "Only do not let yourself be deceived by appearances.",
  "He forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered, he forgot both his sack of money and his wooing, for he was so afraid lest the house-door should come dancing after him.",
  "Now he's gone to the princess; a very neat bow he has made her.",
  "When the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said: What'll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?",
  "The royal cheque-book, bound in red morocco, was brought in by eight pages, with ink and a pen.",
  "Of course he might have locked the things up, and forbidden Ricardo to touch them, but that might have seemed harsh.",
  "For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too.",
  "But just as the hole was made, and the river-sucker was beginning to drink, the Master-maid told the Prince to throw one or two drops out of the flask, and when he did this the sea instantly became full of water again, and before the river-sucker could take one drink they reached the land and were in safety.",
  "After these words the lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall.",
  "The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat.",
  "He went to his own room, took a portmanteau in his hand, sat down on the carpet, and said: I wish I were in Gluckstein.",
  "At length he made out some sort of track, and though at the beginning it was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once, it presently became easier, and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a splendid castle.",
  "Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill.",
  "Already the ground was beginning to tremble; the Earthquaker was stirring in his sleep, for the maiden of the new song had not been sent to him, and the year ended at noon, and then he would rise and ruin Manoa.",
  "The princess did not take advantage of Dick's permission, but advised him to lie down and try to sleep.",
  "For either he would have brought his brothers back, sound and well, to Falkenstein, or he would not survive his dishonour.",
  "Yes, I have certainly studied what is told us about him, said the king.",
  "The Princess, quite overcome by the strangeness of hearing a cabbage, a hen, and a pink speak, and by the terrible sight of an army of rats, suddenly became very pale, and fainted away.",
  "So he easily put a great block on his saddle-bow, and he and the dark lady flew back till they reached the crest of the Mountains of the Moon.",
  "Before the sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see his path, and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair.",
  "He will give a great reward to whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of his youth.",
  "The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him.",
  "It went against all his ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do; but, as he hesitated, a voice in his ear said: Strike!",
  "Gently, gently, said he, not so fast, my friend; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behind a tree; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again, and was thus successfully captured.",
  "The Sultan did not make them wait long for him, and as soon as he arrived Prince Houssain, as the eldest, took his bow and arrow and shot first; Prince Ali shot next, and much beyond him; and Prince Ahmed last of all, but it so happened that nobody could see where his arrow fell; and, notwithstanding all the diligence that was used by himself and everybody else, it was not to be found far or near.",
  "There lay her dear, kind sheep, silent and motionless, upon the pavement!",
  "And that's all I know; for I would not tell a lie, not if it was hever so.",
  "The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it.",
  "The prince stood and looked at him pityingly, and he thought that even a sick old cat was, in some ways, happier than most men.",
  "This just shows me how sensible I have been in never listening to flatterers.",
  "said the Prince, making himself look as stupid as an ass; I should like to see that.",
  "The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage.",
  "But Beauty thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to see the Beast again that she felt as if suppertime would never come.",
  "He wore wooden shoes and a little yellow coat, and as he had no hair and very long ears he looked altogether a shocking little object.",
  "Certainly, madam, said Prigio; and I said so, too.",
  "He again put it down to enchantment, and this time the Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains.",
  "Never you fight, if you can help it, except with plenty of food to keep you going and in good heart.",
  "And after he was gone she was very soon in bed and asleep, and dreaming of her unknown Prince.",
  "Don't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often?",
  "how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks!",
  "Indeed, they did not see him again, for he was on the balcony with Lady Rosalind.",
  "Don't be so impatient, said Snow-white, I'll see you get help, and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard.",
  "One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust.",
  "The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles ' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets.",
  "Come, said the youth, I did n't bargain for that, the seat is mine.",
  "The King sighed, but made no answer -- indeed, what was there to be said to such a clear-sighted person?",
  "Now it happened that his father said to him one day: Hearken, you there in the corner; you are growing big and strong, and you must learn to earn your own bread.",
  "The King stroked it gently, and said to it: Well, bunny, as you have come to me for protection I will see that nobody hurts you.",
  "You have entirely cleared your character, said the king.",
  "You are quite right, cried the King.",
  "See if any one of them is courageous enough, and loves you well enough to come and save your life.",
  "Here, said the dark lady, is the storehouse of all the Stupidity; hence it descends in showers like Stardust on the earth whenever this mountain, which is a volcano, is in eruption.",
  "This is what you must do, they said.",
  "shouted he; there's another half wanted down here, that's not enough; then the din commenced once more, there was a shrieking and a yelling, and then the other half fell down.",
  "Then he replied: I am a merchant, and opening his apron, he let her peep in.",
  "They really were as happy as the day was long.",
  "The King would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing.",
  "Not so funny as your own, said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy; but, madam, I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses -- such as they are -- and to be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am starving, and so is my poor horse.",
  "The ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation, to which the king did full justice; and his majesty was shown to the royal chamber, as he complained of fatigue.",
  "Said the South Wind: It is I, and this is she who should have had the Prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon.",
  "Let us wait and see, answered Beauty.",
  "Indeed, he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali, in the Arabian Nights, bought in the bazaar in Schiraz.",
  "See if she has not upon her finger a ring made of one of my hairs.",
  "Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace.",
  "poor babies; whither are ye come?",
  "Then the princess took a great silver basin, covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver.",
  "You'll bring out my little woman, and she is not easy to satisfy with explanations when she finds me conversing with a lady unbeknown to her.",
  "After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her.",
  "So the people chose for king the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the island in the great chest.",
  "But, in the very centre of the square, was a clear space of ground, on which fell the shadow of a tall column of red stone, all carved with serpents and faces of gods.",
  "said the Ambassador, with perfect truth.",
  "When you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again; but you may take the golden apple with you.",
  "Probably you will be grilled, thank goodness; but who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso?",
  "The other knights all called out to him that he might just as well spare himself the trouble of trying to ride up the glass hill, for it was of no use to try; but he did not heed them, and rode straight off to it, and went up as if it were nothing at all.",
  "The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones.",
  "Upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door.",
  "Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent, and said: I have accepted the crown you have offered me, but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling, who is not dead as you suppose; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again, good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne.",
  "The minister's son was lodged in a grand inn, the gardener's son and the old woman dismounted at the inn for beggars.",
  "yes, said they, very offensive; and the King would give half his treasure to be freed of them, for they not only destroy his dinner, as you see, but they assault him in his chamber, and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping, for fear of them.",
  "When they saw that they could not by any means prevail on him to go in with them, they came out to him with meat and drink, and the best of everything that they had prepared for the wedding; but the Prince refused to touch anything, and would do nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could.",
  "And he began to be very vexed.",
  "At last he took the prince into a corner, on pretence of showing him a rare statue.",
  "You have in your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her.",
  "cried Prince Charles, lifting his golf-club.",
  "So he went into the drawing-room, took his carpet, and wished to be -- now, where do you suppose?",
  "When he arrived at the gates of the castle he distributed the quarters of mutton among the four lions, and, passing through the midst of them bravely, got to the fountain, filled his bottle, and returned back as safe and sound as he went.",
  "I can't appear like this before my own people.",
  "I beg your pardon, mamma, said the poor girl, for not making more haste.",
  "No fear, answered the tailor; they have n't touched a hair of my head.",
  "Then everything became still as death again, and the boy heard something chewing outside the barn door, so he stole as softly as he could to the door, which was slightly ajar, and again there was a horse standing close by the wall of the house, eating and chewing, and it was far larger and fatter than the first horse, and it had a saddle on its back, and a bridle was on it too, and a full suit of armor for a knight, all of bright silver, and as beautiful as anyone could wish to see.",
  "No, that I am not, said she.",
  "The King and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and astonishment, and the marriage of the three Princes was celebrated at once.",
  "Calm yourself, Ricardo, said his Majesty, very pale, but calm and determined.",
  "I come to bring you good news of your ship Unicorn.",
  "Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine.",
  "Then the beautiful lady said: Go forth at once, and do not return to say good-by to your mother, for these things must be done quickly, and the Shoes of Swiftness themselves will carry you to the land of the Three Gray Sisters -- for they know the measure of that way.",
  "My duty is painful, but clear.",
  "Such a good little dog as I am, cried Tintin, could not think of letting either of you die for his mistress.",
  "We shall desert Jaqueline, who was rather less alarmed when she found that she was not to be starved, at all events, and return to Prince Ricardo, whom we left fluttering about as a little golden-crested wren.",
  "When the Prince grew old enough to understand, he soon learned that there could be nothing worse than to be proud, obstinate, and conceited, and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects, but by that time all his faults had become habits; and a bad habit is very hard to get rid of.",
  "The minister's son embarked in this old vessel, and thanks to favorable winds, at length reached his own country.",
  "The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her.",
  "Then she asked him if she could not go with him.",
  "The prince blushed at this, for he knew his conduct had not been honourable.",
  "Meanwhile, the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat; but there was no use in talking to the queen.",
  "So, even if he took off his cap of darkness, and became visible, he was no figure for a ball.",
  "Then he showed the prince two proclamations, which had been posted all about the town.",
  "I can tell you # 1,000,000 is worth having, said the prince.",
  "They are always saying it makes one shudder!",
  "She thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch's power, and willingly consented to marry him.",
  "Whether it is quite fair is another matter; but, at all events, it is not listening.",
  "Why, I can drink the moon!",
  "So they went there again, and there the grass was, standing as high and as thick as it had been before, but that did not make them any kinder to Cinderlad.",
  "The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered.",
  "At this moment in came Bruno.",
  "Since you will not, good-night, Beauty, he said.",
  "it does n't lack anything, replied the Fairy.",
  "All of a sudden -- crash, crash!",
  "Again, when ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu, like a false traitor, you aided and entertained them, though you knew them to be servants of a prince lately in open war against his Imperial Majesty.",
  "So they sent off a messenger to the thicket, and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two.",
  "If she comes at all she must come willingly.",
  "Now there was at the Court a young man, who was more clever and handsome than anyone else.",
  "This counsel pleased the King, and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little tailor, to offer him, when he awoke, a commission in their army.",
  "But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors.",
  "Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went.",
  "When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to marry him to the Princess that very day.",
  "Little Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with the news; and, this first expedition causing him to be known, he got whatever he pleased, for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army.",
  "As she bent over them, enjoying their delicious scent, a soft voice, that seemed to rustle among the leaves, said: Lovely Felicia, the day has come at last when I may have the happiness of telling you how even the flowers love you and rejoice in your beauty.",
  "But in the afternoon, after they had dined at midday, all happened just as the White Bear had said.",
  "Yes, said the Princess, I will gladly consent to that.",
  "'\nBut before the words was out of his mouth, off he flies like a shot through the open door, and his royaliness's parcel with him.",
  "I once blew an aspen leaf there, but I was so tired that for many days afterward I was not able to blow at all.",
  "He then went to the dead magician, took the lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to China.",
  "He thought for a moment, then went out of the room, and, in three steps of the seven-league boots, was at his empty, dark, cold palace again.",
  "You may imagine how much these had cost; but then nothing could have been more brilliant, except the beauty of the Princess!",
  "Hi, Grettel, she called to the girl, be quick and get some water.",
  "Since you are so kind, said she, perhaps you will do me another service, for till it is done I will never be married.",
  "He went in, and saw that nobody had been there since the Captain left it.",
  "Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed, and cried miserably.",
  "He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim's house.",
  "The magician, seeing him coming, followed him with her eyes, till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants.",
  "Have you cleaned the stable?",
  "He does not count his money, he measures it.",
  "I say luckily because if she had heard of them, she would not have believed a word of them.",
  "And still the thing slipped up, from the chink under the mountain.",
  "She had been as sad as anyone when misfortune overtook her father, but, soon recovering her natural gaiety, she set to work to make the best of things, to amuse her father and brothers as well as she could, and to try to persuade her sisters to join her in dancing and singing.",
  "Presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses, and soon the armed troop appeared, led by the Prince, who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand, in order to know the way.",
  "And so is that of a crown prince, answered Prigio; and mine is pledged to a lady.",
  "They could not make out why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; but soon they were all laughing and happy again.",
  "With these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground, and said: If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the wood.",
  "-- The King's Cheque WHEN they all awakened next morning, their first ideas were confused.",
  "Then he began to speak about the reward, and the ` perkisits, ' as he called them, which it seems he had read about in my proclamation.",
  "Princess, said the Queen, weeping, what is this that I hear?",
  "The factor jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his cat, and told the King he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch all these vermin immediately.",
  "But Reldresal, secretary for private affairs, who has always proved himself your friend suggested that if his Majesty would please to spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes, justice might in some measure be satisfied.",
  "Just hold your peace, said the old hag; it wo n't help you.",
  "Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead.",
  "So the Princess's days passed very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come.",
  "For her part, the queen was the most perplexed of all; for she did undeniably wake, and yet she was not at home, where she had expected to be.",
  "How can I explain to you the cause of my hesitation?",
  "There was also much treasure hid in the castle, guarded by evil spirits, which would then be free, and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich.",
  "Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air.",
  "said the prince, thinking of the Firedrake.",
  "Then he dressed himself carefully in rich brocade, with scarlet and white plumes, and threw a splendid embroidered scarf over his shoulder, and, looking as gay and as graceful as possible, he presented himself at the door of the palace, carrying in his arm a tiny pretty dog which he had bought on the way.",
  "Then wherefore would you slay them, when you must all perish?",
  "He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded by my father's command.",
  "Why, Rosina, what a pretty little silver cross you are wearing, he said, and he lifted a curious ornament which hung from a chain on Rosina's neck.",
  "She did see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died.",
  "When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: Do you call that manners, you toad-stools!",
  "The town was just three miles off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery, and the people of the royal town were bad cooks.",
  "I see your hand in that, my dear, and I am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good Fairy Paribanou.",
  "You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess, and puss, as usual, marched in before him, arching his back.",
  "But Aladdin first called the genie.",
  "In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of which extended twenty long poles, with which, we conjecture, the Man-Mountain combs his head.",
  "said his Majesty, severely.",
  "The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells, for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day.",
  "They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.",
  "Whereupon the genie took the Vizier's son out of bed, leaving Aladdin with the Princess.",
  "To my Lord Marquis of Carabas, answered they altogether, for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.",
  "You are very ready with excuses and flattery, he cried; but that will not save you from the death you deserve.",
  "But there he was, dressed just as if he were going out to hunt, if anyone could have seen him.",
  "When he had gone, the prince threw himself at the king's feet, crying: Pardon, pardon, my liege!",
  "Celia was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and misdeeds, and promised to love him as long as she lived.",
  "At the sight of so much majesty, the magician was not only dazzled, but was so amazed that, after she had prostrated herself before the throne, she could not open her lips to thank the Fairy as she proposed.",
  "Then the Beast asked her how she had been amusing herself, and she told him all the rooms she had seen.",
  "Will you be content to stay here when your father goes away?",
  "Here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere.",
  "They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire, scattered it all, and tried to put it out.",
  "Before he set forth he looked round about him, to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey; but he found nothing except an old cheese, which he took possession of.",
  "You see, sir, said the Marquis, this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.",
  "And so it did, he added, for now your sisters are both married and have kingdoms of their own -- and mine shall be for you.",
  "Then he said aloud: I wish to SEEM no CLEVERER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.",
  "After that the courtiers were very quiet.",
  "Encouraged by this advice, the white, slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again, more and more of him uncoiling, as if the mountain were quite full of him.",
  "These fairy books are at the bottom of his provoking behaviour, and he glanced round the shelves.",
  "The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit.",
  "About eight days afterward the wicked Queen said to the clerk of the kitchen, I will sup on little Day.",
  "If anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio -- But here the baby was brought in by the nurse, and the queen almost devoured it with kisses.",
  "On it was written in diamond letters: Jewels for the Bride, and when they opened it, which they did as soon as it was found, there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained.",
  "You, too, are plagued with an Elector?",
  "At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: All the things she has about her -- tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls, and all her household furniture -- are made of gold.",
  "If you had delayed one day more, you would have found him dead.",
  "Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard.",
  "The King of the Sheep was so kind and amusing, and loved Miranda so dearly, that at last she began to love him too.",
  "At night the Princess said good-by to her father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin's palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves.",
  "On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom.",
  "Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps, and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight.",
  "His bad friends, when they heard him, resolved to turn his wrath upon an old nobleman who had formerly been his tutor; and who still dared sometimes to tell the Prince of his faults, for he loved him as if he had been his own son.",
  "But the other officers resented the success of the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away.",
  "-- The Giant sparring for wind, Ricardo cuts him in two at the waist.",
  "I never knew how much I loved you until just now, when I feared I was too late to save your life.",
  "But the minister's son made no reply.",
  "He much preferred to idle about, and know everything without seeming to take any trouble.",
  "I forgot something; you 've got to marry Molinda!",
  "Why, did n't you notice it?",
  "I think I can cure it, said Jaqueline.",
  "The youngest, who was the very picture of her father for courtesy and sweetness of temper, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen.",
  "To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death.",
  "And the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him.",
  "They used to tell the Queen, my mother, that it was so.",
  "Did your lordship ring for coffee?",
  "Yes, now it is clean and sweet, master, said the King's son.",
  "The worst of it was, that as Jaqueline sat and thought and thought, she began to remember that she was back in her own country.",
  "This is a dainty which lions can never resist, and running greedily at it, with four tremendous snaps, they got hold of each other by their jaws, and their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly struggle for existence!",
  "The Princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could, but, the more she washed and rubbed, the larger the spots grew.",
  "It was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books.",
  "This was the newspaper of the period.",
  "I wish my father would go to war with somebody.",
  "Ricardo never has any notion of geography.",
  "Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat!",
  "We have not brought him up rightly.",
  "But then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so violent that the boy thought the walls and roof had fallen down, but when that was over everything suddenly grew as still as death around him.",
  "Therefore, in your new form, take the appearance of all these animals.",
  "don't be so sorrowful, cried Beauty; I am only going to assure my father that I am safe and happy.",
  "Then he answered: Well, I shall beg for a fire, a turning lathe, and a carving bench with the knife attached.",
  "He took a piece of cord and an axe with him, went out to the wood, and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside.",
  "whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside.",
  "So saying she opened a door, and found, to her delight, that it led into her own room, though she had thought it was quite the other side of the palace.",
  "When they reached the palace the gardener's son made a sign to his slaves, who completely undressed the new-comer.",
  "The prince first thought how nice and good she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked.",
  "As night drew on Cassim's wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone.",
  "The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots.",
  "I shall write to the newspapers at once!",
  "The tears came into the Prince's eyes as he begged her to ask him anything but that -- to set him any task she pleased as a proof of his devotion, but to spare him the grief of killing his dear Pussy.",
  "The Fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace, with a box of the same metal, which was a present to her, out of which taking a perfume, and throwing it into the fire, there arose a thick cloud of smoke.",
  "Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks, Spindleshanks?",
  "As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed.",
  "Prince, said the king, as Prigio bowed before the throne, you are restored to your position, because I can not break my promise.",
  "The youth called out the second time: What do you want here?",
  "Celia and Prince Darling threw themselves at the Fairy's feet, and the Prince was never tired of thanking her for her kindness.",
  "He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time.",
  "I 'm about tired, and I thinks of bettering myself.",
  "Some objection was raised by the old priest in the skull mask; but when the Inca promised to make him an archbishop, and to continue all his revenues, the priest admitted that he was perfectly satisfied; and the general public cheered and waved their hats with emotion.",
  "By the way, where is Jaqueline?",
  "Do not give yourself any further trouble, Princess, answered the Dwarf.",
  "Poor Molinda merely stared; for she could not imagine what he meant.",
  "I seem to have been born just to be preached at.",
  "she continued, if my poor Patypata, my dear Grabugeon, and pretty little Tintin, who all died for my sake, were equally well off, I should have nothing left to wish for here!",
  "his Majesty asked, and Rosina, all in a flutter, took it off and gave if to him.",
  "you will see her quite soon enough, said the giant.",
  "No, said the West Wind; so far as that have I never blown; but if you like I will go with you to the South Wind, for he is much stronger than either of us, and he has roamed far and wide, and perhaps he can tell you what you want to know.",
  "After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger, and gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his father, where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return.",
  "She is not coming back any more, he cried.",
  "He gave, however, as good as he got, and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them, till they both fell dead at once on the ground.",
  "Indeed, they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon, though they have written volumes about it.",
  "Never has there been a gayer Court.",
  "Even the horses ' shoes were of rubies with diamond nails, and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen.",
  "He reflected for a little, and then ran upstairs to the garret.",
  "There they were in a moment, among the old knights whom, if you remember, the Remora had frozen into stone.",
  "The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together, that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes.",
  "She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on.",
  "They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed.",
  "They were taller than mortal men, and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it, and two golden serpents twisted round it, and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes.",
  "They were a good deal worn, but fitted as if they had been made for him.",
  "the king remarked as Ricardo entered the room.",
  "Curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun, and wanted much to pull some hair out.",
  "Was Mr. Benson equally ready?",
  "All orders executed with punctuality and dispatch, he added, quoting his own advertisement without thinking of it.",
  "and is Molinda so terrible a person that you prefer those arms, and she pointed to the gibbet, to these?",
  "If you attempt to deceive me you shall be put to death!",
  "Well, that was a very small matter, they thought, and agreed to do it.",
  "Next morning the sheriff came traveling by there.",
  "They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces distance.",
  "Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat's tail is the man she is destined to marry.",
  "Don't affright yourself, Prince, replied the Fairy; you ran a risk in fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father, but there's no danger in finding out this man, who is my brother Schaibar, but is so far from being like me, though we both had the same father, that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense; yet, on the other hand, is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire.",
  "Do not let us buy life at the price of happiness and honour.",
  "` Sit down there, on the carpet, knave, ' she went on; ` ourself and consort ' -- meaning me -- ` will take our places by thy side, and I shall wish us in Gluckstein, at thy master's!",
  "But the pair of us will tackle him.",
  "it is thou who eatest up our hay then, thought the boy; but I will stop that.",
  "The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed.",
  "Prince Ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow stains.",
  "He was very rich and handsome, and when he heard all that was said about Pretty Goldilocks, though he had never seen her, he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither eat nor drink.",
  "By all means, adding an expression of my tender interest in her Majesty's health and welfare, said the king, presenting the count at the same time with a magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait.",
  "'\nTake them both, then, my dear child, he added, and your brother shall have everything else.",
  "Don't you remember that this is your wedding-day?",
  "Never better, sire, said the man, bowing with more courtliness than his profession indicated.",
  "How disappointed she is looking.",
  "Though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies and fairies was, he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass such a tent as his father desired.",
  "In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half what they had to say.",
  "More and more offended, and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him, the prince shouted for the landlord, called for his bill, threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change, and went into the street.",
  "said the little monster, for I am a friend of hers, and, for the matter of that, I am quite as clever as she is.",
  "Their house caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground, with all the splendid furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, and precious goods it contained; and this was only the beginning of their troubles.",
  "Fail not to bring it to me presently, said Blue Beard.",
  "You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King's palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there.",
  "In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said: Snow-white, go and close the shutters, and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span.",
  "He goes on: ` and I am told that I did not misbehave myself, nor disgrace the blud of Bruce.",
  "cried the Prince, I cut off your head!",
  "Then he got up to leave her, and said in his gruff voice: Do you love me, Beauty?",
  "Truly the man would have had no objection to be rich, but he thought to himself: I must first ask my daughter about this, so he went in and told them that there was a great white bear outside who had faithfully promised to make them all rich if he might but have the youngest daughter.",
  "She gave Aladdin the message, adding: He may wait long enough for your answer!",
  "He argued that he did not like to be washed, because the soap got into his eyes.",
  "The queen could not read most of them herself, but the king used to read them aloud to her.",
  "Dick had no answer ready, so he only grumbled: You 're always preaching at me, Jack; everybody always is.",
  "There might be more of them left, he remarked, -- young ones, that would take a lot of killing, -- and he refused to part with his secret.",
  "William said at last, rather as if he were making a speech.",
  "They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: You naughty children, what a time you 've slept in the wood!",
  "What funny thing shall I see next?",
  "Its body is made of iron, and it is always red-hot.",
  "Do not refuse the aid of your most faithful lover.",
  "At night, when they were at supper together, they all agreed to travel for a year, and to meet at that inn; and that the first that came should wait for the rest; that, as they had all three taken their leave together of the Sultan, they might all return together.",
  "But even granting, for the sake of argument, that there is a Firedrake, your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending me.",
  "Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and asked how it had fared with him.",
  "A lovely Princess like you must surely prefer to die rather than be the wife of a poor little dwarf like myself.",
  "Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to pick up far and near any names he could come across.",
  "Thirdly: By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal subjects in that city, and to blow up a party against our crown and our peace.",
  "No, said Aladdin, since chance hath made us aware of its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my finger.",
  "If I had deserved my father's anger I would suffer without a murmur, but, alas!",
  "But, fast as the Remora stole forward, the Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and clashing his fiery wings.",
  "But they had hardly finished their meal when the noise of the Beast's footsteps was heard approaching, and Beauty clung to her father in terror, which became all the greater when she saw how frightened he was.",
  "As the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy, for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all.",
  "So he did what the Princess had taught him, turned the pitchfork round, and worked with the handle, and in the twinkling of an eye the stable was as clean as if it had been scoured.",
  "she was the best girl, and the prettiest, and the kindest.",
  "After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls.",
  "` Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?",
  "I say luckily because if she had heard of them, she would not have believed a word of them.",
  "-- he refused to keep his royal promise, and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship!",
  "They were drifting before a light breeze on a hill lake; Ricardo was fishing, and Jaqueline was sculling a stroke now and then, just to keep the boat right with the wind.",
  "And with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid palace, full of treasures; only the two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were, to remind him of his former poverty.",
  "The ambassador did not know what he meant, for he had never heard of the fight, but he answered gravely: Never more than now.",
  "Then let the slaughterer cut off the head of the horse I rode here upon, because it behaved very badly on the journey.",
  "Anyway, my father must be told; and, if you wo n't, I must.",
  "For he was quite unendurable, the king said, and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him.",
  "Why should you jump up to do that?",
  "As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!",
  "how are we to support our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?",
  "When the experiment has failed, thy head shall from thy shoulders be shorn!",
  "She began to wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of the garden.",
  "The young King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was, and a great banquet was prepared, to which everyone was bidden.",
  "The prince leaped from his horse, leaving Pepper on the saddle-bow.",
  "He likewise distributed presents to all the servants in the house, not forgetting even his old enemy the cook, though she little deserved it.",
  "When they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her, under which was placed a sofa of cloth-of-gold, and presently a dainty supper was served, upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal, while the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the softest music.",
  "Oh, you would know where to go, or Mr. Belsham.",
  "Then everybody would like you!",
  "Had he known that no hero-warrior, but only a little tailor stood before him, it would have gone even more to his heart.",
  "He was ready to do this himself.",
  "Then how does your royal highness mean to treat the proclamations?",
  "With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince's lap, as if he did not see him at all.",
  "The Fairy of the Desert quite baffled me: it was terrible.",
  "I have a little woman of my own, and she's not very fond of other ladies; especially, she would like to poison them that have good looks.",
  "The Sultan then turned to Aladdin's mother, saying: Good woman, a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed.",
  "Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand.",
  "Well, but have you a great deal of money?",
  "He dived into his wallet again, and grasping the bird in his hand, he threw it up into the air.",
  "cried the old king, in French and English; and then he ran up, just in time to hear Prince Charles say: Sir, take your life!",
  "You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow.",
  "The Prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden's company that the time had seemed like a single hour.",
  "Felicia did not answer, but she cried more bitterly than ever, and went away to her own little room.",
  "How lucky it is that he gave it to you!",
  "Then you will find your breakfast waiting for you here, and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard.",
  "I saw her turning little Dollie into a fish and back again in the bath-room last night.",
  "The prince felt his blood stand still, and he grew faint; but he took heart, for there was no time to waste.",
  "On the following morning the man came to him, and, wishing to get his fifty dollars, said: Now you know what it is to shudder.",
  "You have not forgotten any of our aunts?",
  "Hardly had he reached his own house when, taking the ring, he said, Bronze ring, obey thy master.",
  "This news terrified him so much that he determined never to let his daughter be married, for he thought it was better to have no grandson at all than to be killed by his grandson.",
  "What more do you want to make you happy?",
  "Now Ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons.",
  "The prince said nothing, the ambassador said nothing, Lady Rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawing-room.",
  "When he reached the first court of the castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps, and went up them, and passed through several splendidly furnished rooms.",
  "Now, you must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above all the rest, because he was somewhat carroty, as she herself was.",
  "I do not exactly know how many there were, but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home, and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck, and after a long time the King was forced to give him leave to go.",
  "Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs.",
  "And what would you have done?",
  "Nothing worse than death can befall me, thought the Prince, and death is better than endless sorrow.",
  "The magic spell was in Latin, of course; but the princess knew Latin very well, and soon she had the magic song by heart.",
  "But you must do one thing more for me, which will be every whit as agreeable to me.",
  "There it all lay in masses -- the Stupidity of bad Sermons, of ignorant reviewers, of bad poems, of bad speeches, of dreary novels, of foolish statesmen, of ignorant mobs, of fine ladies, of idle, naughty boys and girls; and the king examined them all, and all were very, very heavy.",
  "The minister's son followed the rich stranger, whom he had not recognized.",
  "Then he begged him, for God's sake, to take the mill back again, and that in an instant, for, said he: If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage.",
  "Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest, and desired to lodge there for God's sake.",
  "I 've been asleep, and I had a kind of dream that he beat me.",
  "Then the prince cut off its four hoofs, put them in his wallet, and with these he flew back in a second, and met the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to bed.",
  "Then his mind, somehow, went back to the Council and the ponderous stupidity of the Prime Minister.",
  "Shortly after this, when the sexton came to pay them a visit, the father broke out to him, and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at everything: he knew nothing and learned nothing.",
  "Yes, there was no mistake; the darkness was quite lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the silver.",
  "But she was very much surprised to hear an odd little voice cry out: Oh!",
  "And from high words they soon came to blows, and, alas!",
  "he said to himself, whoever has taken my ring has probably taken my dear wife also.",
  "The Vizier looked out too, and was lost in astonishment.",
  "That which gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny constitution, and scarce ever spoke a word, which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense.",
  "The three maidens are princesses, whom she stole away when they were children together, with all the silver utensils, which she turned into gold flax.",
  "He heard a thrush say to a magpie: How stupid men are!",
  "The king need never be told anything about it, said Jaqueline, need he?",
  "He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way; correcting the accent of his French teacher, and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife.",
  "But remember your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may have cause to repent it, for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful Beast dead.",
  "Seeing a man, he started back in terror.",
  "Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella's clothes, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.",
  "The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall, where several butlers met him, and he laid the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet.",
  "They then buried the bodies in Ali Baba's garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves.",
  "Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.",
  "Young man, said the King, you are welcome, whoever you may be.",
  "Then Benson says: ` Dinner'll be ready in five minutes; how tired I do feel!",
  "But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke, and, though they made one, two, and three to put in its place, that did not help them, for each broke in turn, no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of.",
  "just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in.",
  "The page ran to get the armour; but it was so uncommonly hot that he dropped it, and put his fingers in his mouth, crying!",
  "Miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight, and was looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock, when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her.",
  "And I, said the youngest, shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.",
  "I thought they were sure to have brought it!",
  "The Queen and the Princess were just ready to set out with the King when they saw, advancing toward them from the end of the long gallery, two great basilisks, dragging after them a very badly made box; behind them came a tall old woman, whose ugliness was even more surprising than her extreme old age.",
  "Quite glad to have found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but, to her horror, he did not move or open his eyes.",
  "Nevertheless, he does not cease to persecute me and to kill my subjects.",
  "Lady Rosalind came sweeping down, with a smile on her kind face.",
  "As soon as he had ridden to the top, he took the third golden apple from the lap of the Princess and then turned his horse about and rode down again, and vanished from their sight before anyone was able to say a word to him.",
  "People are so touchy on these occasions, said his majesty.",
  "Benson's evidence was taken first.",
  "He held his sword drawn in his hand, to defend himself if I should break loose; it was almost three inches long, and the hilt was of gold, enriched with diamonds.",
  "When he saw them all so beautiful and so gay he embraced them tenderly, but gave Miranda more kisses than either of the others.",
  "Let the hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver, the sails of brocade; let the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance, dressed like kings.",
  "Touched with compassion, he said to himself: I am very hungry, but I shall not die of starvation before I get my dinner; if I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save her life.",
  "You have come just in time, said the Prince, for I should have been married to-morrow; but I will not have the long-nosed Princess, and you alone can save me.",
  "But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen's Land.",
  "The tallest of the maidens clapped her hands, and immediately a long table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold chicken, and several sorts of delicious ices.",
  "Then she called out: Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm; he is a good, honest creature.",
  "For Alphonso was gone -- crying would not bring him back.",
  "Each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; the horses were decked with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold.",
  "` You have not generally found it so?",
  "The year after, it was Cinderlad's turn, but when he made ready to go the others laughed at him, and mocked him.",
  "Fortunately no accident happened, only once a fiery horse, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and overthrew his rider and himself.",
  "At the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace, and two ladies entered the room.",
  "The Beast must be very hungry, said Beauty, trying to laugh, if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey.",
  "The only thing that I have to add is, that you seemed to me worthy of a more happy fate than that of possessing the Princess Nouronnihar; and, that you might attain to it, I was present when you drew your arrow, and foresaw it would not go beyond Prince Houssain 's.",
  "Then King Prigio advanced, the mighty weight in his hand, to the verge of the dreadful gulf of the Earthquaker.",
  "Then he began to speak about the reward, and the ` perkisits, ' as he called them, which it seems he had read about in my proclamation.",
  "How can we find this bronze ring?",
  "Everyone who should be asked, answered the queen.",
  "While she was saying this, the King, who really loved her as much as ever, was feeling terribly sad at being so rapidly torn away from his beloved Princess, but he knew too well how powerful the Fairy was to have any hope of escaping from her except by great patience and cunning.",
  "When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off.",
  "Hastily the king thrust his feet into the Shoes of Swiftness -- so hastily, indeed, that, as the poet says, he madly crammed a left-hand foot into a right-hand shoe.",
  "The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out: Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.",
  "But just as the King was thinking that it would be well to proclaim that the riding should take place next day for the last time, so that they might have one more chance, he suddenly bethought himself that it would be well to wait a little longer to see if the knight in copper armor would come on this day too.",
  "And then the king told them about Jaqueline and the Earthquaker, and how he needed a great weight of Stupidity to flatten him out with.",
  "But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation.",
  "And here the prince fluttered the cheque for 1,000,000 pounds in the air.",
  "And no sooner had she taken the shirt and dipped it in the water than it was white as driven snow, and even whiter than that.",
  "I returned immediately to the city for help, and after a huge amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a great crowd of people appeared, full of wonder at sight of so prodigious a vessel.",
  "It would be a very fine sight indeed, said this ill-bred minx, to see me go draw water.",
  "cried the merchant, if I were cruel enough to buy my own life at the expense of one of my children 's, what excuse could I invent to bring her here?",
  "But you have so much meat already, replied his wife, you have no occasion; here are a calf, two sheep, and half a hog.",
  "The Black Cat and the Brethren!",
  "But the Princess thought that she had never yet seen so handsome a knight, and while he was riding up she was sitting thinking, Oh!",
  "When the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed, and added: And I shall assuredly keep my word, and shall be faithful to you as I have been to him, even though it should cost me my life.",
  "They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them.",
  "Benson's evidence was taken first.",
  "I may not tell you why; how dare I confide my woes to anyone?",
  "Both sides now attack him on either hand, and the feet kick him severely.",
  "The Fairy Paribanou was at that time very hard at work, and, as she had several clews of thread by her, she took up one, and, presenting it to Prince Ahmed, said: First take this clew of thread.",
  "I was to come here for the giant, and demand the tax for him, said the King's son.",
  "This happened once, and it happened twice, but then the man got tired of losing his crop, and said to his sons -- he had three of them, and the third was called Cinderlad -- that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John's night, for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again, blade and stalk, as it had been the last two years, and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp look-out, the man said.",
  "He examined them all, lifted them up and smelled them, and said at last: This jam seems good, weigh me four ounces of it, my good woman; and even if it's a quarter of a pound I wo n't stick at it.",
  "But if Benson was irritated, and suffered from the remarks of his fellow - servants, I do not think we can envy Prince Prigio.",
  "Her mother, who, since the death of the King, her father, had nothing in the world she cared for so much as this little Princess, was so terribly afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her, and never tried to correct any of her faults.",
  "Still, he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards, backwards, into the cleft below the hill; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered.",
  "Beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she announced her intention of going back at once, and that very night she said good-by to her father and all her brothers and sisters, and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger, and said firmly, I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again, as she had been told to do.",
  "Wait a bit, he said, till the moon is up, and then we'll find our way sure enough.",
  "There knelt and wept the nurses of the Earthquaker on the marble floor; but Jaqueline stood a little apart, very pale, but not weeping.",
  "When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows, but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased; and about four yards from me, for more than an hour, there was a knocking, like people at work.",
  "He was a fine fellow, that was!",
  "'\nThis had not occurred to me, -- I am a plain king, but I at once saw the force of her majesty's argument.",
  "Toward night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on the ground, as I had to do for a fortnight, till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure.",
  "Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing?",
  "The eldest was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother.",
  "His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with him, and, seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses: It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.",
  "The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain of Lions on them, and up, of course, jumped Enrico, just as Alphonso had done.",
  "She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard.",
  "But now it was delightfully fitted up; and Master Frank marched about the house with his tail in the air, as if the place belonged to him.",
  "Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command, for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible, when his majesty yelled: Hi!",
  "But were the king's intentions to go for nothing?",
  "he is dead; and it is all my fault, said Beauty, crying bitterly.",
  "The eldest laughed when he heard this, and thought to himself: Good heavens!",
  "As soon as the door let go its hold of him, off went the attorney.",
  "Prince Charles looked puzzled, but requested Dick to explain his great plan.",
  "she asked first: Is your name Conrad?",
  "But don't let that frighten you: I'll give you means to pass by them without any danger.",
  "There's no kind of danger; and I 'm sure he will approve of the principle of the thing.",
  "When she went away she said to me: ` Be careful of my gifts, good man; see that you do not lose the ring or forget to water the pinks.",
  "Charming knew he could not be far from the Gloomy Cavern, and on looking about him he saw a black hideous rock from which came a thick smoke, followed in a moment by one of the dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes.",
  "and the cliffs opened like a door, and they were within the mountain.",
  "Then up the Firedrake leaped, and hovering on his fiery wings, he lighted in the midst of the Remora's back, and dashed into it with his horns.",
  "This cat Whittington concealed in the garret, for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook, and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice, so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top.",
  "Then, turning to the king, the prince said: Sir, is there no way but by death or marriage?",
  "He, however, very well knew, by the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only asleep; and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups.",
  "He looked on quietly for a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and called out: Be off, you rabble rout!",
  "It is useless to try; the Princess must have told me to do it on purpose, knowing it was impossible.",
  "On the stairs he met the Princess Jaqueline.",
  "Well, the daylight came at last, and the great chest was driven by the waves against the shore of an island.",
  "He had, by order of his master, a flock-bed placed for him in a garret, where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy's nose and disturbed him in his sleep.",
  "I trust you absolutely, cried the King, and I will do whatever you tell me; but if you have seen my Princess I beg of you to tell me how she is and what is happening to her.",
  "he'll never come to any good; as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.",
  "He spake to the King: Your loyalty shall be rewarded, and taking up the heads of the children, he placed them on their bodies, smeared the wounds with their blood, and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened.",
  "The king and queen were sitting in the royal library, of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages, all equally familiar to King Prigio.",
  "The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.",
  "he said: but I thought that I might at least take Beauty her rose.",
  "But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place, and, as she finished doing it, she saw Bruno's hen, and said, catching hold of it: Come here, horrid little creature!",
  "To which she replied: He is my husband, brother.",
  "Taking the magic spy-glass, the king surveyed the world from China to Peru, and, sure enough, there was the famous Flying Horse in the king's stable at Delhi.",
  "Now it happened that one of the Princess's ladies in chasing a spider had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it, and every drop of the water had been spilt.",
  "What was poor Jaqueline to do?",
  "This was allowed by the lawyers present to be very sound law; and Benson was cheered by the courtiers, who decidedly preferred him to Prigio, and who, besides, thought he was going to be crown prince.",
  "Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command, for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible, when his majesty yelled: Hi!",
  "At last some viziers, the Sultan's favorites, who judged of Prince Ahmed's grandeur and power by the figure he cut, made the Sultan jealous of his son, saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people's favor and dethrone him.",
  "Now, on the second day of their honeymoon, the prince and princess were sitting in the garden together, and the prince said, Are you quite happy, my dear?",
  "Still the King did n't want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand.",
  "Yes, but it is not so easy a thing as you think to ride the horse home, said the Master-maid; but I will teach you what to do.",
  "The two women, who were fairies as well as their mistress, after they had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so soon, walked before her, and conducted her through several apartments, all more noble than that wherein she lay, into a large hall, the most richly and magnificently furnished of all the palace.",
  "Glad to see you looking so well.",
  "By this time the storm was much abated.",
  "Now all this time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most modest way; for, as he said: I did n't kill him: and it is really the Remora, poor fellow, who should marry Molly; but he's dead.",
  "'\n` No, ' replied the old fairy, ` we will have nothing but your little daughter.",
  "As she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry.",
  "However, look he did, and saw the dwarf un-catted, and Pepper, the gallant Dandie Dinmont, with his teeth in the throat of the monstrous Spanish cat.",
  "said the sheriff; I will do that!",
  "So, with great care, she made some of the proper cake to pacify the lions, and one night went up to her room very early, pretending that she was going to bed; but instead of that, she wrapped herself in a long white veil, and went down a secret staircase, and set off all by herself to find the Witch.",
  "Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably.",
  "He had lost strength, no doubt: for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds, and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter; but so did the roars of the Firedrake.",
  "Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard, his heart beating loudly with excitement.",
  "So she seated herself on his back, and off he went from his house in great haste, and they were not long on the way.",
  "-- and the post-mark is ` Roma ': that's Rome in some lingo, I expect.",
  "he asked, in a kind voice.",
  "I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to my native country, and begged his orders for materials to fit it up, and leave to depart -- which, after many kindly speeches, he was pleased to grant.",

  "She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens, when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave, and running quickly to see what could be the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his side, apparently dying.",
  "said he to himself, what would not one endure to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in such a fine coach?",
  "They have not hurt the carpet?",
  "Only he claimed the reward, which was offered, if you remember, not to the man who killed the beast, but to him who brought its horns and tail.",
  "And do not imagine that you can hide from me, for if you fail to keep your word I will come and fetch you!",
  "He had just entered the counting-house, and seated himself at the desk, when somebody came, tap, tap, at the door.",

  "He never went to war with anybody.",
  "she cried; was I not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to which that frightful Yellow Dwarf brought me?",
  "Dick's taste is for adventures; I only wish some accident would make him take to books.",
  "Why is my Princess snatched from me?",
  "But the beast had been too greedy and too hurried, so he missed his aim the first time.",
  "There he turned the books upside down, in his haste, till he found an old one, by a French gentleman, Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac.",
  "How he wished he had the seven-league boots on, or that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket!",

  "It's a fine head, whatever, he added, meditatively.",
  "For all these reasons, and because they were so fond of the queen, his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King Prigio.",
  "Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests.",
  "I wish he would not call me Jack, said the princess to the queen.",
  "They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.",
  "However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed all in tears.",
  "When he had written it down he was looking round him, pleased to find himself in such a pretty place, when all at once he saw a great golden carp lying gasping and exhausted upon the grass.",
  "One moment longer, if you please, said his wife, and then she cried out very softly, Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?",
  "Will you do something for me?",
  "Good-day, good woman, answered he.",
  "Since mine was another 's, I understand too well the feeling of yours!",
  "But if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife, and half his kingdom into the bargain; he might have a hundred horsemen, too, to back him up.",
  "Sir, replied the crier, the thing is known and averred by the whole city of Samarcand; but, without going any further, ask all these merchants you see here, and hear what they say.",
  "He had said it was easy to do this; but now, as he sat and thought over it, he did not feel so victorious.",
  "Now, the prince had never heard that Fire-drakes could fly; indeed, he had never believed in them at all, till the night before.",
  "I don't know the priests of Manoa; I don't know any new sleepy song.",
  "Had it not been predicted?",
  "They sat down to supper, and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother, whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest, speaking almost always all together.",
  "In all his adventures the prince had never been in greater danger.",
  "She lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long, and she now is the one whom I must marry.",
  "All the palace was in confusion on account of the King's death, but tiny Frisk made his way through the crowd to the Princess's side, and said: Madam, do not forget poor Charming.",
  "There must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!",
  "Going at an alarming sacrifice!",
  "She was half-drowned in tears, crying out: Alas!",
  "But it was the most extraordinary thing, an unpredicted eclipse of the moon!",
  "But tell me, have you supped?",
  "With the Sword of Sharpness I 'd make the enemy whistle!",
  "That boy will never understand our foreign relations.",
  "There came a clear, hissing answer, like frozen words dropping round him: Wait till I come down.",
  "He went straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn, the Hereditary Master of the Ceremonies, and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady.",
  "I can not ring for the servants and make them take her away.",
  "He knew them to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer, so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead.",
  "he cried, rushing between the Fairy of the Desert and the King.",
  "PRINCE DARLING ONCE upon a time there lived a king who was so just and kind that his subjects called him the Good King.",
  "Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always.",
  "So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure.",
  "Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming, he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard.",
  "But I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other as I had taken them up.",
  "They were pawing the ground in their impatience to start, and the merchant was forced to bid Beauty a hasty farewell; and as soon as he was mounted he went off at such a pace that she lost sight of him in an instant.",
  "Then they began to implore the boy to give them their eye back again, and he could not help being sorry for them, they were so pitiful.",
  "Yes, that I have, master, said the Prince.",
  "Don't you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?",
  "This was the first time she had ever called her child.",
  "The merchant ate his with a good appetite, as the Beast's generosity made him believe that he might perhaps venture to come back soon and see Beauty.",
  "-- The Very Last THE princes returned to Gluckstein on the carpet, and went to the best inn, where they dined together and slept.",
  "In a hollow of the hill, sure enough there was the sword of Enrico, the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun.",
  "I only just wanted to tell you -- But I really can not listen to anything until I have had something to eat, cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; but then, remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy's help, he added: I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should quite forget my own hunger; but my horse, who can not hear you, must really be fed!",
  "He only wanted to give him a fright or two, and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself.",
  "The boar pursued him into the church, but the tailor skipped round to the door, and closed it securely.",
  "Lord Kelso rang the bell, and in came all the servants, with William, the under-butler, at their head.",
  "How pretty you are, Felicia!",
  "yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved.",
  "When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven's name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.",
  "He had a writing-book in his pocket, and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the Princess, before he forgot it.",
  "By rights my old woman and I ought to have it for our Christmas dinner, but, since you have set your hearts upon it, I must just give it up to you, said the man.",
  "She employed her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot.",
  "As he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace.",
  "When she found that the King did not return, she hastened out to look for him, and reached the shore, with a hundred of the ladies of her train, loaded with splendid presents for him.",
  "Your son has been the cause of a pretty misfortune, she cried; he threw my husband downstairs so that he broke his leg.",
  "Without your help, I tremble to think what might have occurred.",
  "Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days without eating, so much were they transported with joy.",
  "Indeed, madam, said the king, no one knows it better than I do.",
  "beautiful Fairy, the fairy who brought me here first took away my sight, but by her voice I recognized her as the Fairy of the Desert, though what she should have carried me off for I can not tell you.",
  "She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!",
  "said the Dwarf, showing his yellow teeth with a detestable grin; while Ricardo turned quite white with anger, and not knowing how to deal with this insufferable little monster.",
  "At the same time she put a little gold ring upon his finger.",
  "But the pair of us will tackle him.",
  "After that the courtiers were very quiet.",
  "As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince's table, said: Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare.",
  "All we can do is to fasten them up and leave them ready.",
  "The prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning.",
  "There was the Marquis de Carabas, who, as everyone knows, was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period.",
  "At last he said: I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin.",
  "` Why, your majesty, ' says he, ' I just sat down on that there bit of carpet, wished I was here, and here I ham.",
  "She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince: King's son, you are welcome; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you.",
  "Good-evening, said the man.",
  "There is the gallows, here is Lady Molinda.",
  "At last they reached the King's great city, and he came out to meet the Princess, bringing magnificent presents, and the marriage was celebrated with great rejoicings.",
  "Can not the whole proclamation be annulled, and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up this flimsy scroll?",
  "When she awoke she was dismayed to find her basket empty.",
  "Prince Houssain might have made a longer abode in the kingdom and Court of Bisnagar, but he was so eager to be nearer the Princess that, spreading the tapestry, he and the officer he had brought with him sat down, and as soon as he had formed his wish were transported to the inn at which he and his brothers were to meet, and where he passed for a merchant till they came.",
  "that is n't your kitten, that's the morning sun shining on the chimney.",
  "For one moment the water hissed in his ears, and then all was silent.",
  "GROGNIO R. H 'm, said the prince; I did not think his majesty wrote so well; and he would have liked to say, Don't you think we might join the ladies.",
  "I then took off my spectacles, and after waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput.",
  "When you come back with the horns and tail of the Fire-drake, you shall be crown prince; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar School -- it is all he is fit for.",
  "First blood for the prince!",
  "The maiden could not rest for thinking of this.",
  "What other answers she gave I can not say, but I am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her.",
  "he cried, is it not enough that I have done everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome?",
  "So she thanked Charming, and ordered that preparations should be made for her departure, and they soon set out together.",
  "the king went on speaking to himself.",
  "And when at last the time came for him to go, and he asked, as he had so often asked before, Beauty, will you marry me?",
  "I am truly grateful to you for your hospitality, which was so magnificent that I could not imagine that you would be offended by my taking such a little thing as a rose.",
  "Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own hand.",
  "with what awful anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a parent's heart can know.",
  "Your Majesty has only to command, said Herr Schnipp.",
  "But when she got as far as the same fatal orange tree, and saw it covered with flowers and fruit, she stopped and began to gather some of the oranges -- and then, putting down her basket, she sat down to eat them.",
  "The poor little dog, who did n't understand this at all, pulled at his coat to make him at least look at her, and this made Prince Darling so cross that he gave her quite a hard kick.",
  "And these roads have you to travel.",
  "He can't stay here for ever; and without his carpet he can't get away, for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street.",
  "He is made exactly as the Sultan your father has described him, and has no other arms than a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight, without which he never stirs, and which makes him respected.",
  "Come hither, Fanny; look what comes out of thy sister's mouth when she speaks.",
  "But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.",
  "They all went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew.",
  "No trace of Celia was to be seen, and the Prince, in despair, determined to search through the world till he found her.",
  "Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy, and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen.",
  "Then turning to his youngest son he said: Have you come back alone, after all?",
  "And it seemed to Beauty, now she understood him better, that when she said, No, Beast, he went away quite sad.",
  "He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink.",
  "But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots, his sword, his cap, his cloak -- all his clothes, in fact, except those he wore, -- had been taken away by the courtiers, merely to spite him!",
  "he asked, quietly; and when he was told Yes, he bowed and withdrew, with majestic composure.",
  "Soon after this the false bride said to the Prince: Dearest husband, I pray you grant me a favor.",
  "madam, said the Princess, I am so happy that I should like everybody else to be happy too.",
  "At that instant the Vizier, who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand.",
  "And now, here's Dick, the monarch continued, I can't hold him back.",
  "He was dressed in tartan, which Ricardo had never seen before; and he wore a kilt, which was also new to Ricardo, who wondered at his bare legs -- for he was wearing shoes with no stockings.",
  "Prince, said she, go when you please.",
  "The King looked at him, and because he pleased him, he said: You can ask for three things, none of them living, and those you may take with you into the castle.",
  "you miserable creature, now you will soon know what it is to shudder, he cried, for you must die.",
  "So saying, she sank down into the water again, leaving Charming greatly astonished at her politeness.",
  "At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it.",
  "Will you not stay and sup with me?",
  "Everything was quiet, and everything stayed quiet, and when he had lain still a short time he heard something that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn door.",
  "Whereupon the Emperor, his father, made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs.",
  "He pondered long and deeply over the matter, and finally came to a conclusion.",
  "So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; but though the wall did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top.",
  "Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate.",
  "Honored King, said the wizard, the wind has blown this illness upon your son, and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved.",
  "He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might have frozen the most fearless person with horror.",
  "He soon found the place, and the door in the rock.",
  "He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.",
  "After supper they went into another room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with tapestry worked with butterflies ' wings of every color; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons.",
  "Some of the black cats had followed him, and, not having been fed for several days, they were fearfully hungry, and made terrible havoc among the mice.",
  "We don't know, your lordship.",
  "Some of the Fairy's women, who came into the hall with them, and guessed her intentions, went immediately out, and returned presently with some excellent meats and wines.",
  "The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said, We will never desert each other, Rose-red answered: No, not as long as we live; and the mother added: Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.",
  "The ambassador did not know what he meant, for he had never heard of the fight, but he answered gravely: Never more than now.",
  "Already the light of the sun shone slanting half-way down the hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the Flying Horse, and drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls.",
  "They had six horses already, and now they put in eight, and then ten, and then twelve, but the more they put in, and the more the coachman whipped them, the less good it did; and the coach never stirred from the spot.",
  "When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter.",
  "I killed the birds, said Ricardo, in Pantouflian.",
  "The prince said this, because he did not wish Alphonso to know that he and Enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair with the monster.",
  "Then he jumped on the Flying Horse, galloped down and down, till he reached his palace gate; called for Ricardo, set him behind him on the saddle, and away they rode, above land and wide seas, till they saw the crest of the hollow hill, where Jaqueline was with the Earthquaker.",
  "The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier.",
  "Then he showed the prince two proclamations, which had been posted all about the town.",
  "So they did this and returned to the little room, where, to their astonishment, they found breakfast ready.",
  "In the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other.",
  "So she promised to have him, and he sat down on the bench by her to arrange about it, but suddenly she said that she had forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night, and must do it.",
  "It was not easy to have the better of an enchantress like Jaqueline and a prince like Ricardo.",
  "The raven perched upon a tree very joyfully.",
  "But your base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty.",
  "You can have no reason for it, such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting against his country.",
  "The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard.",
  "How still it was, how deserted; not a sign of life, and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing.",
  "Bruno had gone out into the forest, never thinking that Felicia would search in his room for the pinks, and she was delighted by his unexpected absence, and thought to get them back without further trouble.",
  "He walked fast, looking anxiously round him, and longing once more to see his darling Bellissima, but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid's diamond sword.",
  "The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey.",
  "Now when there was anything to be done, the eldest had always to do it; but if something was required later or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard or some such ghostly place, he always replied: Oh!",
  "Next day all the knights and princes were to appear before the King and Princess -- it had been too late for them to do it the night before -- in order that he who had the golden apple might produce it.",
  "The Princess ran and opened the window, and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up.",
  "His joy at seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly.",
  "So this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones.",
  "Now, when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys, she gave each maiden work for six days, with the usual warning: Children, don't let your eyes wander, and on no account speak to a man, for, if you do, your thread will lose its brightness, and misfortunes of all kinds will follow.",
  "It was a frame of wood, raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels.",
  "I am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without a thought of me.",
  "I wish I could -- I wish I could --; she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.",
  "And, above all, do not desert me until you have saved me from my cruel misery.",
  "From another pocket hung a huge silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it, a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal; for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures, and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shining substance.",
  "So ended these unfortunate lovers, whom not even the Mermaid could help, because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword.",
  "Then he stirred the fire, blew it up, and placed them all round in a circle, that they might warm themselves.",
  "At last the little tailor, losing all patience, reached out of his chimney corner for a duster, and exclaiming: Wait, and I'll give it to you, he beat them mercilessly with it.",
  "Some few days afterward she went thither herself, and said to her clerk of the kitchen: I have a mind to eat little Morning for my dinner to-morrow.",
  "But now it was delightfully fitted up; and Master Frank marched about the house with his tail in the air, as if the place belonged to him.",
  "He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a roc's egg.",
  "One evening, when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief: Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I can not see them starve to death before my face; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done; for, while they are busy in tying up fagots, we may run away, and leave them, without their taking any notice.",
  "That's a good joke, answered the little tailor, and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle.",
  "They both came in very warm; for they had been whipping tops, and the day was unusually hot.",
  "He rose early next morning, and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests.",
  "He played with them and lost some of his money, but when twelve struck everything vanished before his eyes.",
  "The woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor's room, and he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him.",
  "This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert, the Dwarf's trusted ally in every sort of mischief.",
  "The prince thought a minute, then he said: Your will is law, my dear; anything to please you.",
  "said the brothers, you look as if you were fit to be among such great lords, nasty beast that you are to sit there!",
  "There he saw a deer's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle.",
  "Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice.",
  "It is often confusing to waken in a strange bed, much more so when you have flown through the air, like the king, the queen, and Benson the butler.",
  "He got a trout every cast, great big ones, over a pound, and soon he had a basketful.",
  "Come down quickly, cried Blue Beard, or I will come up to you.",
  "But the King seized her hand and spake: I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem.",
  "how ill have I rewarded such great fidelity!",
  "They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing the King was there.",
  "The officer fell on his knees at once, crying: Pardon, my prince, pardon!",
  "On the way, instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him, he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes, and bit and tore at his chains furiously.",
  "dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.",
  "And here the prince fluttered the cheque for # 1,000,000 in the air.",
  "But somebody must have it, said the King, for with our own eyes we all saw a man ride up and take it.",
  "The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see, however far off.",
  "My necklace, replied the girl.",
  "she cried to the king, throwing her arms round him again.",
  "I do, said the blind mouse, for without my watchfulness our boat would have drifted away to the open sea.",
  "Ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground, and rushed to Jaqueline, and embraced her in his arms; and, oh!",
  "The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.",
  "The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way and said to the giant: Fancy a big lout like you not being able to carry a tree!",
  "While she was speaking, they found themselves in Suliman's hall, and his delight was great at seeing his dear master once more.",
  "You know as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded, up to now.",
  "But they sat there and did not move, and the fire caught their clothes.",
  "After wandering about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this cottage.",
  "Yes, it could make salt, said he who owned it, and when the skipper heard that, he wished with all his might and main to have the mill, let it cost what it might, for, he thought, if he had it, he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous sea for freights of salt.",
  "We desired that it should be opened, and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the mid-leg in a sort of dust, some of which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing.",
  "cried the prince again; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious effort, and rising on his wings, dropped just on the spine of his enemy.",
  "He was a little brighter than the ashes that you sit grubbing among, you dirty black creature!",
  "Then Charming was led in, and was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at first not a word could he say.",
  "Because, sire, she answered, white suits me better than anything else.",
  "But the castle clock struck half-past seven; dinner was at eight, and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret.",
  "Thank you, prince, said Ricardo, for the weapon, which I shall learn to wield; and I entreat you to honour me by receiving this fairy gift -- which you do not need -- a ring which makes all men faithful to the wearer.",
  "Only listen, she said, holding the acorn to his ear.",
  "` You did n't believe there were any Firedrakes?",
  "Blanchette darling, how could I do it?",
  "The proud but feel a sharper pain, And make a greater triumph his.",
  "In the morning the King came, and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him, and that he was dead.",
  "But why do I bandy words with a miserable peasant?",
  "Did I not cause the ring to jump out of the man's mouth?",
  "It was as flat as the head of a skate-fish, it was deathly pale, and two chill-blue eyes, dead-coloured like stones, looked out of it.",
  "At this noise the King put his head out of the coach-window, and, finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his Lordship the Marquis of Carabas.",
  "The prince almost fainted: everything seemed to swim; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top, and the white head would have crawled over him, and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone.",
  "For she thought them dead ever since they had been taken away without her knowledge.",
  "One was blind, the second lame, and the third had her ears cropped.",
  "She would have told me if she had.",
  "Well, to oblige you, I'll try to struggle against old age, he said; but there are always accidents.",
  "Toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard a shriek from a corner.",
  "I wonder what the young rogue is about to-day?",
  "Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them.",
  "Drink this liquor, said she; it is the Water of the Fountain of Lions, and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever.",
  "The Prince immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder, his long beard, which he held up before him, and a pair of thick mustachios, which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his head, which was far from being of the smallest size, and on his head he wore a grenadier's cap; besides all this, he was very much hump-backed.",
  "Your Majesty, replied the Prince, will find in that crystal chair a little white cat, which has such soft paws, and mews so prettily, that I am sure you will be charmed with it.",
  "And then he opened the tower door and called to Charming, who came very sadly and kissed the King's hand, saying: What have I done, sire, to deserve this cruel treatment?",
  "There he left them, and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea, and had helped him to start on his journey.",
  "You must fetch me the horns and the tail of the Fired rake.",
  "Really, they were quite wonderfully pretty.",
  "I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us.",
  "You have committed three faults.",
  "replied the queen; for the king's aunts were old-fashioned, and did not approve of her, and she knew it.",
  "He had not brought the Cap of Darkness, and, in the shape of a wren, of course he could not carry away the other articles.",
  "Her majesty's expressions are ever choice and appropriate, said the ambassador.",
  "So he took him over everything, and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he did not open.",
  "I thank you for the kindness you have shown me, which has made me your friend for ever.",
  "The hut was razed to the ground, and the Prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after.",
  "And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that nobody should dare to come near it.",
  "Her father, however, was pleased, but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty presents, he told her to choose something.",
  "The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them.",
  "They wrangled on for a time, till, as both were tired, they made up the matter and fell asleep again.",
  "Perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre.",
  "The Princess, who, in spite of her wilfulness, really loved her mother with all her heart, was much grieved when she saw her looking so sad, and often asked her what was the matter; but the Queen, who did n't want her to find out the truth, only said that she was ill, or that one of her neighbors was threatening to make war against her.",
  "The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the Prince and said: The wizard of Finland greets thee and bids me say that thou mayest free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear thyself all over with mud; then say: ` From a man into a crab, ' and thou wilt become a crab.",
  "said the youth, I would give worlds to shudder, but no one can teach me.",
  "His enemies at once went to the King and said: You will hardly believe, sire, what Charming has the audacity to say -- that if he had been sent to the Princess Goldilocks she would certainly have come back with him.",
  "Queen, said he, I know you very well, and I know how much afraid you are of the lions; and you are quite right too, for they have eaten many other people: and what can you expect, as you have not any cake to give them?",
  "-- The Prince Falls in Love HE understood all this, and burst out laughing, which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits.",
  "The boots were very long and large, but, as they were fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little, according to the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him.",
  "Then the two brothers mocked him just as they had done before, and told him that they could see that he must have watched the grass very carefully that night, for he looked just as if he were walking in his sleep; but Cinderlad did not trouble himself about that, but just bade them go to the field and see.",
  "Your monkey and your dog could talk, madam, said he; are you more astonished at us than at them?",
  "There is no other way of saving ourselves.",
  "I slept about eight hours, as I was told afterward; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's orders, had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine.",
  "The crier, who took him for a merchant, replied: If this price seems so extravagant to you, your amazement will be greater when I tell you I have orders to raise it to forty purses, and not to part with it under.",
  "Go, Felicia, said the Queen, stroking her cheek softly; I will wait here until you come back.",
  "Well, your correspondent seems to be a descendant of his.",
  "However, the princess did not think about right and wrong, unluckily.",
  "Instead of having their heads cut off in the usual way, their faces were bathed with the water, and they instantly fell asleep and never woke up any more.",
  "I'll go this way and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest.",
  "The bird, enchanted to be free, soared up into the sky, and flew away never to return.",
  "When he had traveled about for several days, he came to a giant's house, and hired himself to the giant as a servant.",
  "And I should have fallen, dear Rosalind, if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you.",
  "Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant.",
  "The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no uncle of Aladdin 's, but a cunning magician, who had read in his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man in the world.",
  "Next morning they, and the ambassador, who had been told all the story, and Lady Rosalind, floated comfortably on the carpet, back to Falkenstein, where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico.",
  "The carpet would not work, sir, said Dick.",
  "The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled.",
  "When he got the door open, he did not stay long in the room, but ran out, and the herrings and pottage came after him, and it streamed out over both farm and field.",
  "And after about an hour's talk Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first.",
  "I was extremely tired, and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep.",
  "As he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly, and would have given all he possessed to have her once more alive.",
  "But I can't help feeling sorry for the poor children, added the husband.",
  "Wait a bit, he said; I'll stir up the fire for you.",
  "ay, answered Little Red Riding-Hood; it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.",
  "But you were very glad of them when you made the Ice-beast and the Fire - beast fight and kill each other, said the queen.",
  "She desired to have everything brought up to her, but he said: There is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house.",
  "Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls.",
  "The King could not see any cause for anger either when the matter was presented to him in this light, and he began to frown very fiercely at the courtiers who had so misrepresented his favorite.",
  "Outside it an aged woman was sitting, playing with a golden apple.",
  "But imagine the distress of the Prince when, from the giddy height at which they were rushing through the air, he saw his beloved Princess in a castle built of polished steel, the walls of which reflected the sun's rays so hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder!",
  "All that the friendly Mermaid could do for them was to turn them into a pair of beautiful trees which intertwine their branches.",
  "Here he was interrupted by a noise above his head -- someone was opening a window, and he saw with delight that it was Celia herself, who came forward and threw out a plate of most delicious-looking food, then the window was shut again, and Prince Darling, who had not had anything to eat all day, thought he might as well take the opportunity of getting something.",
  "At last the door opened again, and the Forty Thieves came out.",
  "Moreover, six of his Majesty's greatest scholars were employed to teach me their language, so that soon I was able to converse after a fashion with the Emperor, who often honored me with his visits.",
  "She was certain Dick would get himself into a scrape; how was she to help him?",
  "But in that place there were some Christian folk who had been carried off, and they had been sitting in the chamber which was next to that of the Prince, and had heard how a woman had been in there who had wept and called on him two nights running, and they told the Prince of this.",
  "First-rate, he answered; and now I 've survived the one night, I shall get through the other two also.",
  "I will therefore go back with my father to keep his promise.",
  "She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases.",
  "The mother of Aladdin bowed low and went home, thinking all was lost.",
  "Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it.",
  "I would far rather die myself than hurt you; but even if I am killed you will not be safe: we must find some way of making the King believe that you are dead.",
  "One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha's stall.",
  "And she remembered with horror that once a year her people used to send a beautiful girl to the Earthquaker, by way of keeping him quiet, as you shall hear presently.",
  "I am quite satisfied with it, and have no wish to have it shorter.",
  "I found her in the condition you see her in, and promised her the assistance she stands in need of, and am persuaded that you, out of your own goodness, as well as upon my entreaty, will not abandon her.",
  "Now the King, though he felt that he was growing old, did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well, so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them.",
  "You see how short a time I took in coming to your call from Pantouflia.",
  "But occasionally Rosalind would say, I do believe, my dear, that you are really as clever as ever!",
  "At the same time a lady of majestic port and air advanced as far as the porch, attended by a large troop of ladies, so finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress.",
  "It was arranged that the Inca, with his other daughters, should visit Pantouflia immediately, both because he could not bear to leave Jaqueline, and also because there were a few points on which he felt that he still needed information.",
  "Then the White Bear knocked on it, and a door opened, and they went into a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone with gold and silver, likewise a large hall in which there was a well-spread table, and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to make anyone understand how splendid it was.",
  "The first she entered was lined with mirrors, and Beauty saw herself reflected on every side, and thought she had never seen such a charming room.",
  "if I only knew what it was to shudder!",
  "Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there.",
  "Indeed, they did not see him again, for he was on the balcony with Lady Rosalind.",
  "said the prince, you are forgiving -- For you are brave!",
  "But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.",
  "But no sooner had he got the piece of apple in his mouth than he forgot the Master-maid and that he was to go back in the coach to fetch her.",
  "my, she cried; what beautiful gold wares!",
  "They did n't awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his sister, saying: Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will show us the way back to the house.",
  "After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep: My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I'll box your ears.",
  "And me, and Thomas -- as did n't see it, -- and cook, we thinks as how Benson was come for.",
  "Answer, cried the youth, or begone; you have no business here at this hour of the night.",
  "Exceedingly was she delighted with her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the King, at his return, how the mad wolves had eaten up the Queen his wife and her two children.",
  "If he had been too warm before, the prince was too cold now.",
  "Is it because you hate me that you want to escape?",
  "We think he have been come for!",
  "He declined to say exactly where or how he killed the Firedrake.",
  "But they did not think it well to trouble the good queen with the dangers Dick had encountered.",
  "And he told Dick how much he had owed to Jaqueline, in the fight with the Yellow Dwarf, and the fight with the Giant, for he did not think it necessary to mention the affair at Rome.",
  "It is clever; everything the king does is clever, and he is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm.",
  "Indeed, the daughters at first hoped that their friends, who had been so numerous while they were rich, would insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one.",
  "She said she was a Daughter of the Sun; but that, of course, is absurd, unless -- By Jove!",
  "Prepare me a ship of which the half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let the sails be in rags, and the sailors infirm and sickly.",
  "But dinner does not take very long when you are all by yourself, and very soon she sat down cosily in the corner of a sofa, and began to think about the charming Prince she had seen in her dream.",
  "At last she could bear it no longer, and resolved to seek help from the Prince.",
  "For that reason, that I may be able to share the amusements of my people, whom I soon hope to lead to a glorious victory, followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign, I am acquiring a difficult art.",
  "Tell me what goes on nowadays; are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever?",
  "Son, answered the Sultan of the Indies, I can not refuse you the leave you ask me; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me; at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come, or when I may think your presence necessary.",
  "Pepper was flying at his heels, and, with great agility, was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade.",
  "So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage, and first all the dishes and tubs were filled, and then it came out all over the kitchen-floor.",
  "After doing this, the man replied that her Royal Highness had not been in the palace all day.",
  "One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink.",
  "Then there came a whisper, like the breath of the bitter east wind on a winter day: Where are you, and how can I come to you?",
  "Prigio sprang into the saddle among the salaams of the dusky multitude, and all the ladies of the seraglio waved their scented handkerchiefs out of the windows.",
  "'\nsaid she, ` if you really loved me you would not care where you were -- a cave, a wood, a fox-hole, a desert, would please you equally well.",
  "Your parents dwell here now, said the White Bear; but do not forget what I said to you, or you will do much harm both to yourself and me.",
  "I wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances?",
  "I consider that it means strange things against me, therefore I order you to take her away into the forest and kill her, and, that I may be sure it is done, you must bring me her heart and her tongue.",
  "My brothers, said he, may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.",
  "on every seat was a lovely fairy, dressed in green, each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand.",
  "Who is this man, she said, who eats no salt with his meat?",
  "The boots, now I come to think of it, are unimportant, at least for the present.",
  "The prince had disarmed him.",
  "The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them: You are mistaken; my son loves me, and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity, as I have given him no reason to be disgusted.",
  "Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said.",
  "Here is good game, which comes very quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two.",
  "Having been privately told that I had befriended them, they made me a visit, and paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity, invited me to their kingdom in the Emperor their master's name.",
  "They reported to the Prince that Suliman, for that was the tutor's name, had boasted of having helped Celia to escape, and they bribed three men to say that Suliman himself had told them about it.",
  "Then, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship, I tied all the cords together at the end.",
  "It might bring both you and me to great grief.",
  "I 'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants; seven at a blow, that's my motto.",
  "The eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow; he would watch the grass, he said, and he would do it so well that neither man, nor beast, nor even the devil himself should have any of it.",
  "Oh, but I think I have got a kind master, said the Prince.",
  "Then he sat down at his fire and fell asleep.",
  "cried the king, dropping the high style in which he had been speaking, and becoming the father, not the monarch, -- why, if you could kill the Firedrake, did you let your poor little brothers go and be b -- b -- b -- broiled?",
  "She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things.",
  "Then he heard the voice again, and it said: Alas!",
  "As he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses or carriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own consent.",
  "I would do a great deal more than that for the Princess.",
  "Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed, but the magician advised differently: Make him give you all kinds of wonderful things, by the Fairy's help, till she tires of him and sends him away.",
  "Cast her from his arms for ever, Bury her in the rippling river.",
  "So there was a wedding, and Cinderlad got the King's daughter, and everyone made merry at the wedding, for all of them could make merry, though they could not ride up the glass hill, and if they have not left off their merry-making they must be at it still.",
  "Then came one so full of sparks that they flew both out of his eyes and his nose.",
  "Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning.",
  "His anger was terrible, and he vowed vengeance against whoever had helped her to escape.",
  "The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat.",
  "cried Miss Charlotte; lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as thou art!",
  "Then Prigio went up the hill some way, first warning Alphonso not to sit on his carpet for fear of accidents like that which happened to Benson.",
  "Here, under my roof, you are safe for the moment; but a prolonged stay -- excuse my inhospitality -- could not but strain the harmonious relations which prevail between the Government of Pantouflia and that which I have the honour to represent.",
  "It is well for you that you have not asked for a horse-load, said he who had come out of the rock.",
  "The young man followed the old beggar-woman's directions.",
  "cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the Beast angry by refusing.",
  "Yes, father, whatever you wish; and if that's all you ask, I can easily keep it in mind.",
  "Then the old beggar-woman said to her benefactor: This is what you must do to obtain the reward which the King promises.",
  "There they were in a moment, among the old knights whom, if you remember, the Remora had frozen into stone.",
  "The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel, and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast, which indeed it was.",
  "So, just to make everything orderly and correct, Ricardo and Jaqueline were married over again, in the Cathedral of Pantouflia.",
  "Then his horse, which was most finely caparisoned, and was as beautiful a creature as any in the Sultan of Indies ' stables, was led to him, and he mounted him with an extraordinary grace; and, after he had bid her a last adieu, set forward on his journey.",
  "Tell me when you have got hold of the door-latch, said the Master-maid.",
  "So the King's guards went to fetch Charming, who had thought no more of his rash speech, and carried him off to prison with great cruelty.",
  "One of them Beauty recognized as the stately lady she had seen in her dreams; the other was also so grand and queenly that Beauty hardly knew which to greet first.",
  "Just you sit down and wait a minute, till I fetch him.",
  "So when she had reached home and had gone to bed it was just the same as it had been before, and a man came and lay down beside her, and late at night, when she could hear that he was sleeping, she got up and kindled a light, lit her candle, let her light shine on him, and saw him, and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever beheld, and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must die if she did not kiss him that very moment.",
  "When they had eaten, the woman said: Alas!",
  "The eldest had the mill, the second the ass, and the youngest nothing but the cat.",
  "But, as I suppose, pursued she, that you have eaten nothing to-day, a slight repast shall be served up for you, while preparations are making for our wedding feast at night, and then I will show you the apartments of my palace, and you shall judge if this hall is not the meanest part of it.",
  "When you have done this, you may rest for the remainder of the day, for you shall see what an easy master you have come to, and then he went away.",
  "So, making him mount her chariot, to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which generally drew it, away she flew with him.",
  "At last, however, the Queen had a daughter.",
  "By dint of magic, he could put his head on again, just as if it had been his hat, if you gave him time enough.",
  "Moreover, they shot another flight into the air, of which some fell on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand.",
  "Prince Enrico, the second, was tall, thin, and a little sad, but never too clever.",
  "I had a capital day, Jack; rescued a princess, too.",
  "First: By abandoning the post of danger against the Firedrake, whereby our beloved sons, Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico, have perished, and been overdone by that monster.",
  "But, after all, it was only a dream, so why should I trouble myself about it?",
  "Then he seized the ivory glass, clapped it to his eye, and looked for the Remora.",
  "Call off your dog, you coward, and come down off your horse, and fight fair!",
  "Let me alone, old witch, cried the young man; I can do nothing for you, and so saying he went on his way.",
  "The other lad had a broad Scotch bonnet on, and no wig; beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his shoulders.",
  "She received them graciously, but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the Prince, to whom she said: You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat.",
  "I recognize you, said the Princess; you are the gardener's son whom I have always loved, and it is you I wish to marry.",
  "The king was out, but Semiramis was in -- Semiramis, the great grey cat, sitting on a big book on the top of the library steps.",
  "As it was quite the nicest time of the year when Miranda arrived in this delightful land the only palace she saw was a long row of orange trees, jasmines, honeysuckles, and musk-roses, and their interlacing branches made the prettiest rooms possible, which were hung with gold and silver gauze, and had great mirrors and candlesticks, and most beautiful pictures.",
  "This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success.",
  "Put on your most beautiful dress, he said to her and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have forgotten me.",
  "The king did not ask what they were; as a rule, they were simple.",
  "The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea, and at last, by contrary winds, driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was inhabited by Moors unknown to the English.",
  "But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them.",
  "However, the Firedrake's dead and done for; so never mind him.",
  "He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle.",
  "I accept the alternative, he said, if your majesty will grant me my conditions.",
  "At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave.",
  "In his Cap of Darkness a poor brute of a dragon can't see him.",
  "From the battlements of the palace the king's guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing spears.",
  "The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for this Ogre was a very good husband, though he used to eat up little children.",
  "THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOOD There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had no children; so sorry that it can not be expressed.",
  "They went to all the waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no purpose.",
  "Not so long, mother, as you think, her son replied.",
  "There was my poor father, King Grognio, he wanted me to take to adventures, like other princes, fighting Firedrakes, and so forth; and I did not care for it, till you set me on, and he looked very kindly at her Majesty.",
  "She were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of Finland.",
  "The Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the Dear Little Princess's tiny nose!",
  "Full of doubt and fear, the Prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden.",
  "Why, what do you take me for?",
  "yes, cried she; but must I go thither as I am, in these nasty rags?",
  "Then number three spake: I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King has n't even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die.",
  "At last the prince spoke: This is a very strange story, Lord Kelso!",
  "At first she would not let the Master-maid remain with her; but at last, after a long time, by means of good words and good payment, she obtained leave.",
  "Her majesty had been travelling by post all the time, and, luckily, had heard of none of the doings since Prigio, Benson, and the king left Gluckstein.",
  "His Sword of Sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a blow!",
  "This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince, in the midst of all his courtiers, in these words: Son, said he, I have one thing more to ask of you, after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience, nor your interest with your wife.",
  "We are nurses of the Earthquaker, they said.",
  "Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold.",
  "I have already six kingdoms, permit me to bestow one upon you, and upon each of your sons.",
  "Again he heard the water-lily's lament, and, hesitating no longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: From a man into a crab, plunged into the river.",
  "It is truly beautiful, said the false Fatima.",
  "The king's mind was so much confused by this time, that he determined to leave it to the Lady Molinda herself.",
  "So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode a wearisome long way onward again, and after a very long time she came to a great mountain, where an aged woman was sitting, spinning at a golden spinning-wheel.",
  "Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother's cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it.",
  "Then spake number two: I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.",
  "well, she has just stolen out for a little, thought the giant, and he took a spoon, and went off to the cauldron to have a taste; but there was nothing in it but shoe-soles, and rags, and such trumpery as that, and all was boiled up together, so that he could not tell whether it was porridge or milk pottage.",
  "If neither of them is willing, you must come alone, after bidding them good-by for ever, for then you will belong to me.",
  "Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail; the difficult thing was to kill the monster.",
  "At early dawn the giants went off to the wood, and quite forgot about the little tailor, till all of a sudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner.",
  "It was an account of a voyage to the moon, in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known; for few travellers have been to the moon.",
  "Well, said the East Wind, I have heard tell of the Prince, and of his castle, but I do not know the way to it, for I have never blown so far; but, if you like, I will go with you to my brother the West Wind: he may know that, for he is much stronger than I am.",
  "The prince thought a minute, then he said: Your will is law, my dear; anything to please you.",
  "I should not care so much if only my dear daughter were married.",
  "Dick now crept out of the royal waistcoat, flew to the king's ear, twittered, pointed out of the window with one claw, and, lying down on his back, pretended to be dead.",
  "There came a clear, hissing answer, like frozen words dropping round him: Wait till I come down.",
  "Then he said, Send Trusty John to me.",
  "And he wished he had the chance.",
  "I have looked at you enough.",
  "answered Dick, who never could understand anything about politics.",
  "Everyone thought that he could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for them all.",
  "At night, too, Cinderlad's brothers came home again and had a long story to tell about riding up the glass hill.",
  "My dear prince, said Charles, throwing himself into his arms with rapture, and kissing him in the Italian fashion, which Dick did not half like, you are, indeed, worthy of your reputation; and these are the celebrated Seven-league Boots?",
  "But the boy flew south between sea and land, keeping the land always on his left hand, till he saw a beautiful island crowned with flowering trees.",
  "The fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse, who had spoiled him when he was little.",
  "One must take what is given one.",
  "Page, my chain-armour, helmet, lance, and buckler!",
  "I was telling you that I was your father's friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least, he used to say so.",
  "Well, the prince walked into The Bear, and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him.",
  "They attended him to the frontiers of Pantouflia, singing his praises, which Ricardo had the new and inestimable pleasure of knowing to be deserved.",
  "But the queen, though she saw them distinctly, took no notice of them.",
  "When Miranda heard it she begged the King of the Sheep to allow her to go and see the wedding as before.",
  "The poor bird was closely pursued by an eagle, which would soon have eaten it up, had not Charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the eagle dead.",
  "It is yours already, lovely Princess!",
  "There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven's sake.",
  "For either he would have brought his brothers back, sound and well, to Falkenstein, or he would not survive his dishonour.",
  "At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before.",
  "you must tell me how to do it, said the Prince, for I have never yet been underground, and even if I knew the way I do not know how much I am to demand.",
  "All around were things like marble statues of men in armour: they were the dead bodies of the knights, horses and all, who had gone out of old to fight the Remora, and who had been frosted up by him.",
  "They aver that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre's boots he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in pain about a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off, and the success of a battle.",
  "It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to decline an order; and if your Majesty asked for my heart's blood, I am ready to shed it, not to speak of anything in the line of my business -- namely, boot and shoe making.",
  "On hearing this argument, the king so far forgot himself as to cry, Bravo, well said!",
  "On reaching the cavern -- a huge tunnel in the rock -- where the Giant lived, Ricardo blew a blast on the horn which hung outside, and in obedience to a written notice, knocked also with a mace provided by the Giant for that purpose.",
  "Frisk was so terrified at the sight of it that he did not know where to hide.",
  "Then the Beast warned him to remember their agreement, and to prepare his daughter exactly for what she had to expect.",
  "Just you sit down and wait a minute, till I fetch him.",
  "The old King begged her to tell him all, and left her no peace, but he could get nothing out of her.",
  "said he, that must be an owl in great trouble, I am sure it has gone into a snare; and he began to hunt about, and presently found a great net which some bird-catchers had spread the night before.",
  "At last he drew near the giant's castle, and saw to his horror that every path that led to it was strewn with bones.",
  "The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel, and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast, which indeed it was.",
  "The younger was a pretty dark boy, with a funny little roundabout white wig.",
  "He knew that the poor tailor's son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and traveled night and day until he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin's ruin.",
  "They took his advice, and got home presently.",
  "You are quite right, said the princess; but as there is no harm done, we'll say nothing about it this time.",
  "He ceased playing, and listened to what they were saying, for he understood their language.",
  "Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened.",
  "Here's my hand, how it does sting!",
  "Indeed he does, madam, said all her maids of honor in one breath.",
  "To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait!",
  "But I will teach you how to do it; you must turn your pitchfork upside down, and work with the handle, and then all will fly out of its own accord.",
  "If you do, I will take your life.",
  "She was afraid to take it until the Queen said: It is yours, Felicia; go and water your pinks with it, and let it remind you that the Queen of the Woods is your friend.",
  "Then he spake: Dear wife, we can restore him to life, but the price asked is our two little sons; we must sacrifice them.",
  "Sire, she said, I am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill so worthily.",
  "So he threw open the parlor door, but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too, and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch.",
  "Then she asked him what he had to do that day.",
  "I'll soon put a stop to the business, said the tailor.",
  "I always said you would come back after a little trip -- did n't I, Prigio?",
  "If that's all he wants, said the sexton, I can teach him that; just you send him to me, I'll soon polish him up.",
  "The Troubles of King Prigio.",
  "On hearing this the King was at first very angry, and then he wept and sighed, and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter; but the young Princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry the gardener's son.",
  "The Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the capital; but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body.",
  "She entered it and asked if she might be allowed to stay there.",
  "And thus she rode far, far away, until they came to a great mountain.",
  "and the door remained fast.",
  "Then, from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth, black hill, -- a chink no deeper than that under a door, but a mile wide, -- stole out a hideous head!",
  "He hated the Remora so much, that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair.",
  "And then the prince told them, shortly, all about it: how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties, which had been given him at his christening; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them; and how, probably, the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go, namely -- to the king's Court at Falkenstein.",
  "But the White Cat said to him: King's son, do not trouble yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you.",
  "William stammered, and seemed at a loss for a reply.",
  "That is not in my power, said the genie; I am only the Slave of the Ring; you must ask him of the lamp.",
  "The Queen was well satisfied with the idea, but the armor-bearer, who had overheard everything, being much attached to his young master, went straight to him and revealed the whole plot.",
  "Now, when the giant had slept a good long time, he began to stretch himself on the bench on which he was lying.",
  "The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage, and the Emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within two yards of the stage, whence she could view the whole performance.",
  "He then laid all the treasure at his master's feet, who refused to take any part of it, but told him he heartily rejoiced at his prosperity, and hoped the wealth he had acquired would be a comfort to him, and would make him happy.",
  "It was sharp work, he said to himself, but much more exciting and glorious than the usual business.",
  "All the blossoms then are found Downward fluttering to the ground, Hoping she may tread on them.",
  "In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window.",
  "The King will come back to life, and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old.",
  "Away flew the factor, while another dinner was providing, and returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also.",
  "They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and were served by the Princess's officers, the violins and hautboys played old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time, the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains.",
  "He opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows, where the housemaid kept her mops and brooms, and shut himself in.",
  "Well, so I have, said Cinderlad.",
  "Trusty John is free once more, and we have our two small sons again.",
  "When they had sat at the table for a short time, the Master-maid took out the cock, and the hen, and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the giant's house, and set them on the table in front of her, and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple.",
  "Put on your armour, and be off with you!",
  "Oh, Jaqueline, was it honourable, or fair to the astronomers and men of science, to say nothing about it?",
  "Can you tell me the way then, and I will seek you -- that I may surely be allowed to do!",
  "Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses ' feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down.",
  "The first time was of no great importance, and I could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without giving me warning.",
  "Now, at this very moment -- when the prince, all of a sudden, was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened!",
  "Then he led him through some dark passages to a forge, and grasping an axe he drove one of the anvils with a blow into the earth.",
  "Dare to lay a finger upon this illustrious Fairy!",
  "and, with an awful roar, two lions rushed from a neighbouring potato-patch and made for Ricardo.",
  "but he always replied: That's not my name.",
  "That's the worst of it all, said Dick.",
  "The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven fairies.",
  "But true, added the prince; at least, there is no reason in the nature of things why it should n't be true.",
  "You have asked all the right people, my dear?",
  "said he; and then he put the horses back into the stable, and went into the King's palace, and there it was settled that he should marry the bride's sister, who had rolled the apple to him.",
  "What arms can I make use of to reduce him to my will?",
  "One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: What's to become of us?",
  "Upon her head she wore a splendid crown, her lovely hair waved nearly to her feet, and her stately figure could easily be distinguished among all the ladies who attended her.",
  "Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance, as they had never expected to see her again, and there was no end to the questions they asked her.",
  "Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.",
  "Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way.",
  "Upon the very top of this the King's daughter was to sit with three gold apples in her lap, and the man who could ride up and take the three golden apples should marry her, and have half the kingdom.",
  "Do me this other important piece of service, and thereby complete the duty of a good son toward a tender father.",
  "Well, here is the ham, and now you must go straight to Dead Man's Hall, said the rich brother, throwing the ham to him.",
  "All day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him, but as he loved her he could not make up his mind to have her punished.",
  "She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her.",
  "Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him.",
  "It was a splendid room, hung with portraits of the royal ancestors.",
  "But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years, for every St. John's eve, when the grass was in the height of its vigor, it was all eaten clean up, just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night.",
  "And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it.",
  "Yes, answered the second, but he's not got her yet.",
  "The crier presently showed him, and he looked through, wishing at the same time to see the Sultan his father, whom he immediately beheld in perfect health, set on his throne, in the midst of his council.",
  "We never know how far we may be carried, and so Jaqueline found out.",
  "Save my life, genie, said Aladdin, bring my palace back.",
  "What would that matter to you?",
  "a great troop of pretty girls passed, sweeping in and out of the halls in a kind of procession, and looking unhappy and lost.",
  "They made a new bottom as fast as they could, but, no matter how they nailed it together, or what kind of wood they used, no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again, so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin.",
  "no, said the Princess, not until you have brought me some water from the Gloomy Cavern.",
  "Perhaps, Herr Schnitzler, you will kindly write an order for it, as I wish no one of you to leave the palace, if you can conveniently stay, till your business is finished.",
  "Down below there was such a storm!",
  "The maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home, telling no one what she had heard.",
  "You and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes, but that this request does not come from you, but from the brother of the African magician, whom you destroyed.",
  "When you go near it, fire will burst out of its nostrils like flames from a pine torch; but be very careful, and take the bridle which is hanging by the door there, and fling the bit straight into his jaws, and then it will become so tame that you will be able to do what you like with it.",
  "When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: Now, children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I'll light a fire that you may not feel cold.",
  "And sister Anne said: I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.",
  "Where are the Seven-league Boots?",
  "None on mine, certainly, said Ricardo, holding out his hand, which the Giant took and shook; but Duty is Duty, and giants must go.",
  "First of all, you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted, and you thought all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure; then you were really angry, which is very naughty indeed; and lastly, you were cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be ill-treated.",
  "The Princess, not knowing its value, laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange.",
  "The princess also went to her room, or bower as it was then called, but not to sleep.",
  "When he got back to his lodging he went to bed without eating any supper, and his little dog, who was called Frisk, could n't eat any either, but came and lay down close to him.",
  "what will be the end of it all?",
  "A sword, with a sword-belt, he buckled about his waist; and the rest of the articles, a regular collection of odds and ends, he left just where they were lying.",
  "she set down her pails, and examined one thing after the other.",
  "Have you fetched the horse back from the mountain-side?",
  "Pretty little creatures, she said, how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room, that I might often hear you sing!",
  "Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I'll knock you down the stairs.",
  "'\n` And whose fault is it, ' she answered, ` that you have never understood me until now?",
  "You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news, and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of marrying the Princess; but, after all, Bellissima could not have married twenty kings -- indeed, she had found it quite difficult enough to choose one, for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world who was worthy of her.",
  "However, little Frisk came to console him, and told him all the news.",
  "He declined to say exactly where or how he killed the Firedrake.",
  "he replied; but first let me see your paws.",
  "You would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it had n't hindered you from doing what you wanted to.",
  "The next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates.",
  "However, thrusting against it, it opened, and discovered an easy descent, but no steps, which he walked down with his arrow in his hand.",
  "Charming thought it was very nice of the raven to say so, and went on his way.",
  "I have never done you any harm, and have always spoken well of you to the King.",
  "As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded.",
  "For an hour, with pleasure, Herr Schmidt, said the monarch.",
  "You had better put on flannels, Alphonso, for this kind of work, said Prigio.",
  "He placed the bread beside him, went on sewing, and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger.",
  "After this, it rained very hard, which wetted them to the skin; their feet slipped at every step they took, and they fell into the mire, whence they got up in a very dirty pickle; their hands were quite benumbed.",
  "You were resolved to go into the closet, were you not?",
  "It was as broad as a table-cloth, and the address was written in letters as long as a hoop-stick.",
  "You shall have a son, who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you ever tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish away instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again.",
  "Therefore his Imperial Majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and strength, has commanded me to set the case before you.",
  "So back they came, in time to get their share of what was going; and they drank the Remora's very good health, when Prigio told them about the fight.",
  "Rather a neat thing; drew it up myself, added his majesty.",
  "Though your mother's care is deep, You can lie with heart at rest In the narrow brass-bound chest; In the starless night and drear You can sleep, and never hear Billows breaking, and the cry Of the night-wind wandering by; In soft purple mantle sleeping With your little face on mine, Hearing not your mother weeping And the breaking of the brine.",
  "They all asked her how she was getting on where she was.",
  "The talking sheep received me as their king, and told me that they, too, were unfortunate princes who had, in different ways, offended the revengeful fairy, and had been added to her flock for a certain number of years; some more, some less.",
  "One was fair, with yellow locks, the colour of the harvest moon.",
  "So he set out on his way, and did exactly what the Master-maid had told him.",
  "Then he drew forth the head from his wallet, and when the King's eyes fell on it, instantly he was turned into stone, just as he stood there with his sword lifted!",
  "You must die, madam, said he, and that presently.",
  "You ladies will excuse me, I am sure, if I remove first from the dungeon her whom we call the Princess Jaqueline.",
  "Then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass which the king held, and down it shot full on the body of the Earthquaker; and where that had been was nothing but a vast abyss, silent, empty, and blank, and bottomless.",
  "He'll be late for dinner, as usual, I daresay.",
  "I am so happy, Bellissima answered: do leave me in peace, madam.",
  "Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.",
  "So saying, she quickly collected a bundle of sea-weed, and, blowing it three times, she said: My friendly sea-weeds, I order you to stay here stretched upon the sand until the Fairy of the Desert comes to take you away.",
  "What kind of a thing is that, master?",
  "Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were * both dangerous and unnecessary.",
  "When he thought Ricardo was getting near the place, the king put on his Wishing Cap, sat down before the magic crystal ball, and kept his eye on the proceedings, being ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right moment.",
  "The giant made an attempt, but could n't get over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had the better of him.",
  "When he had done that, he went back again into the room in which the giant had given him leave to stay, and there he walked backward and forward on the floor, and began to hum and sing.",
  "She did not believe in fairies: she said that they had never existed; and that she maintained, though The History of the Royal Family was full of chapters about nothing else.",
  "In no ordinary circumstances could they have been baffled and defeated; but now it must be admitted that they were in a very trying and alarming situation, especially the princess.",
  "And the King cried out: All I have in the world will I give up for your sake.",
  "for I swore not to by heaven, otherwise I should have lost my life.",
  "So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded, and went away with the messengers, taking his wife and his son with him; and the King, delighted to have found a real gardener, entrusted him with the care of his garden.",
  "But when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared and, though she looked everywhere, not a trace of it could she find.",
  "He showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the others.",
  "At first the man would not hear of parting with it, but the skipper begged and prayed, and at last the man sold it to him, and got many, many thousand dollars for it.",
  "A favoring breeze was carrying them toward the island where the queen of the mice was awaiting them.",
  "Charming was very much surprised by this answer, but he bowed low to the Princess, and begged her to accept the embroidered scarf and the tiny dog he had brought with him.",
  "The Sultan granted this, and told Aladdin's mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she must not appear before him again for three months.",
  "King's son, she replied, it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but to catch mice; but you must not stay.",
  "But poor Molinda merely cried.",
  "But all at once, just as they were starting, the bottom of the coach fell in pieces.",
  "The Earthquaker wo n't do you any harm; it's only for safe keeping I'll put you with him.",
  "There you see what has brought me all my wealth!",
  "So the raging beast was caught, for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window.",
  "you are not so unfortunate as you suppose.",
  "Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down.",
  "Thereupon he tolled the bell, went home to bed without saying a word, and fell asleep.",
  "The poor queen cried a good deal; Prigio being her favourite son, on account of his acknowledged ability and talent.",
  "It is quite true, said the King.",
  "So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him.",
  "So she resumed her usual form, and walking to the edge of the darkness, found that it was not empty air, but something black, soft, and strong -- something living.",
  "Here he was, restored to his position indeed, but by no means to the royal favour.",
  "She was ten times more beautiful than before, and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe, sparkling with jewels.",
  "Beneath them lay the City of Manoa, filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains.",
  "There is none may taste of the golden fruit Till the golden new time come Many a tree shall spring from shoot, Many a blossom be withered at root, Many a song be dumb; Broken and still shall be many a lute Or ever the new times come!",
  "Then the girls were very angry with Beauty, and said it was all her fault, and that if she had asked for something sensible this would never have happened, and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her folly.",
  "not very dangerous work, I fancy, said the King's son.",
  "And when the prince, after having his ears boxed, said that force was no argument, the king went away in a rage.",
  "The prince stood and looked at him pityingly, and he thought that even a sick old cat was, in some ways, happier than most men.",
  "Very well, said the king; Prince Prigio, you have your choice.",
  "The guards at the palace gate were asked: If they had not seen a princess go out.",
  "they had vanished, he knew not how or where!",
  "said Prince Ricardo several times, buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horse's head.",
  "Then they all wept softly in the stillness.",
  "Letting go the cord, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands.",
  "He left the government of the kingdom to the Queen his mother, and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and children.",
  "Though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest, he was so anxious to be at his journey's end that he resolved to go on; but night overtook him, and the deep snow and bitter frost made it impossible for his horse to carry him any further.",
  "At least, said he, you have the satisfaction of dying unmarried.",
  "All night Charming sighed and lamented.",
  "Truly, Charming, said she, you must be the favorite of some fairy, or you could never have found it.",
  "When I have cleaned out the stable I shall be done.",
  "First: By abandoning the post of danger against the Firedrake, whereby our beloved sons, Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico, have perished, and been overdone by that monster.",
  "I wonder if they shine in the dark?",
  "And you see everything has come right, as I hoped it would.",
  "The poor man screamed terribly, and the colonel and his officers were much distressed, especially when they saw me take out my penknife.",
  "you have insulted your prince and your superior officer.",
  "The man went out to see what could be the matter, and when he got out there stood a great big white bear.",
  "The poor creature told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out infinite numbers of diamonds.",
  "I can hardly believe, sir, that the conduct of Benson, whom I always found a most respectable man, deserved -- That he should be ` come for, ' said the prince.",
  "My heart is still more wild than thine, For Fate is cruel unto me.",
  "I will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose.",
  "I 'm looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell, answered Hansel.",
  "As he said, nothing could be simpler.",
  "She could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree, and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree, and how they had all died to save her life.",
  "When he had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his cigarette.",
  "Turning at the word, he observed that the two lions were stiff and dead, locked in each other's gory jaws!",
  "He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the country.",
  "But he never came back again!",
  "Now the Queen had been shut up in a great tower by the King's orders, and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the Fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder, taking her little baby with her.",
  "She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more.",
  "He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter.",
  "So the two went into the gardens together, and talked about a number of things; but at last the prince told her that, before three days were over, all would be well, or all would be over with him.",
  "If ever I thought an enemy was killed and done for, it was that Giant, said he.",
  "Once he would not have cared, but now he cared very much indeed.",
  "You'll enjoy it more, and I daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game.",
  "Take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own, and fill them with everything you wish to take with you.",
  "And mine too, cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, if you will consent to marry me.",
  "The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide, and said: Well, I never thought to see you alive again.",
  "The boy was proud, and spoke without thinking: Then I swear that I will bring the Terrible Head, if it may be brought by a living man.",
  "You must be very fond of being eaten up alive.",
  "You are quite right, answered the Fairy; but it is not in my power to make Prince Darling a good man unless he will help me; he must himself try hard to become good, I can only promise to give him good advice, to scold him for his faults, and to punish him if he will not correct and punish himself.",
  "There was Cinderella, the grandmother of the reigning monarch, with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her.",
  "Be very sure that I will take care of you, and water you well, and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your stems.",
  "Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle.",
  "She was extremely anxious.",
  "Upon which Prince Ahmed told the crier he would give him forty purses if he cured the sick person.",
  "Then he came back, and, passing before the Princess's window, he began to cry out: Who wants some pretty little red fishes?",
  "The King and Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned for dead.",
  "For your reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant you everything you desire.",
  "The King, her father, gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than he gave the others in a year; but she was so generous that she shared everything with her sisters, and they were all as happy and as fond of one another as they could be.",
  "And so accomplished, added Queen Rosalind.",
  "If I may believe you, replied Prince Ahmed, the virtues of this apple are wonderful, and it is invaluable; but what ground have I, for all you tell me, to be persuaded of the truth of this matter?",
  "Then the King continued: My love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it; my very life depends on my winning her.",
  "But what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the house were pale and thin, and their clothes were torn, and hanging in rags about them.",
  "Beauty answered politely, and quite enjoyed telling him all that had happened to her.",
  "The woman exclaimed: What a donkey you are!",
  "Fear nothing, Aladdin said to her; you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust father, and no harm shall come to you.",
  "What to do with you, I 'm sure I don't know.",
  "When the day appointed by the King had come, there was such a host of knights and princes under the glass hill that they seemed to swarm, and everyone who could walk or even creep was there too, to see who won the King's daughter.",
  "The King's heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his head.",
  "And he is to blame for all her misfortunes, added the magpie.",
  "At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings, and spake these words aloud: Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster.",
  "There is no one here, I hope, but respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt's confession?",
  "said Prince Charles, who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground, and the blade bent.",
  "But, madam, may I, without being guilty of ill manners, dare to ask you by what adventure you know me?",
  "Which of them will you have, my dear?",
  "However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.",
  "Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand; the blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.",
  "It was not that the fagot-maker was not, perhaps, more vexed than his wife, but that she teased him, and that he was of the humor of a great many others, who love wives to speak well, but think those very importunate who are continually doing so.",
  "Let me be transported to Gluckstein, left there unguarded, and if, in three days, I do not return with my brothers safe and well, your majesty shall be spared a cruel duty.",
  "Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my son Aladdin.",
  "The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched, and a moment after appeared six goats, harnessed to a pumpkin, which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it, and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down.",
  "And was he then -- tired -- of me?",
  "She made up her mind quickly, while Dick was putting his things together.",
  "We have suffered so much evil together, and love each other so much, said the Prince; and he insisted on going home for the coach with the seven horses, and she was to wait for him there, by the sea-shore.",
  "But the bear began to speak, and said: Don't be afraid: I wo n't hurt you.",
  "When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.",
  "People in glass houses should not throw stones, Dick, said Jaqueline.",
  "The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world.",
  "Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct?",
  "Things are not as they appear.",
  "After three days ' search, they found the hut.",
  "yes, I will soon tell you that; you must go to the rock there under the mountain-ridge, and take the club that is there, and knock on the rocky wall, said the Master-maid.",
  "I never thought there was much in physical science of any sort; most dreary stuff.",
  "So the Master-maid asked him, as she had asked the sheriff, if he had a great deal of money, and the attorney said he was not ill off for that, and would at once go home to get it; and at night he came with a great big sack of money -- this time it was a four-bushel sack -- and set it on the bench by the Master-maid.",
  "He had the miller's daughter put into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all into gold before the following morning.",
  "He turned quite pale, and said: Will you kindly ask the servants where the little Persian prayer-rug and the parcel which I brought with me have been placed?",
  "When he's fat I'll eat him up.",
  "These were nothing less than diamonds, even to her shoes, which were covered with them, and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered with a dozen of the sun's rays.",
  "The King summoned all his goldsmiths, and they had to work hard day and night, till at length the most magnificent things were completed.",
  "But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it, and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved, and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world.",
  "So nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage, which stood in the midst of a dark forest, and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the earth.",
  "The old King, who was looking out of his window, beheld her in this plight, and it struck him how sweet and gentle, even beautiful, she looked.",
  "With any blade a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight.",
  "The light fell on the strange heaps of fairy things -- talismans and spells.",
  "Not believe in Firedrakes!",
  "But she was very young, and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise.",
  "'\nSo your man merely said, ` Very well, mum, -- your majesty, I mean, ' and sat down.",
  "And the prince said: Oh, if you wish it, you shall have the horns and tail of a Firedrake to hang up in your hall, to-morrow evening!",
  "But though they were rich now, and lived in town again, and had plenty of acquaintances, Beauty found that nothing amused her very much; and she often thought of the palace, where she was so happy, especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear Prince, and she felt quite sad without him.",
  "The Prince saw how naughty he had been, and promised to try and do better in future, but he did not keep his word.",
  "Go, and let my orders be executed.",
  "there runs a little mouse; anyone who catches it may make himself a large fur cap out of it.",
  "That night, when he was alone in his room, a beautiful lady suddenly appeared before him; her long dress was as white as snow, and she had a crown of white roses upon her head.",
  "Have you learned now what shuddering is?",
  "Y -- es, cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.",
  "If only a roc's egg, replied he, were hung up from the middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.",
  "You are quite right to take care of your heart, pretty one, said the Queen.",
  "Now he's cutting her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness.",
  "Only one tradesman, bowing very deep and blushing very much, said: Your Majesty, will you hear me for one moment?",
  "People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle, but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do, or considering whether they are able to do it, which is not charity.",
  "For, he said, however flourishing we may seem to foreigners, we are in danger of an invasion from the island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as large and as powerful as this of his Majesty.",
  "Sir, replied their spokesman, we can not find jewels enough.",
  "Everyone answered according as they had heard.",
  "Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges.",
  "He went to the rocky wall, and took the club, and knocked on it.",
  "The thunder crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the two basilisks appeared, one on each side of the bad Dwarf, like giants, mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they looked like flaming furnaces.",
  "So he marshalled them in order, and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein and cry: Prince Prigio is coming!",
  "It is true she can not get at Pantouflia very easily; we have no sea-coast, and we are surrounded by friendly countries.",
  "I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship.",
  "He then shut the door and went into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterward and knocked at the door -- tap, tap.",
  "Therefore, as neither tapestry, ivory perspective glass, nor artificial apple have the least preference one before the other, but, on the contrary, there's a perfect equality, I can not grant the Princess to any one of you; and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is the glory of having equally contributed to restore her health.",
  "Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles, and in less than three hours I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.",
  "Enough of this fooling, sir!",
  "He went and lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants; and, having learned that there were four principal divisions where merchants of all sorts sold their commodities, and kept shops, and in the midst of which stood the castle, or rather the King's palace, he went to one of these divisions the next day.",
  "When she reached it she sat down upon the brink to rest, but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming toward her, surrounded by numbers of attendants.",
  "But the one she already knew said to her companion: Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible enchantment.",
  "And inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: Bow-wow!",
  "As midnight approached, a noise and din broke out, at first gentle, but gradually increasing; then all was quiet for a minute, and at length, with a loud scream, half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him.",
  "What are you standing there gaping for?",
  "When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival.",
  "You wish to leave me, Princess, said he; it is my unhappy fate -- you are not to blame.",
  "Now he's cutting the beast's head off.",
  "Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.",
  "A prince you may be, but you have not learned the exercises of gentlemen.",
  "There was great rejoicing over the arrival, and the Prince sprang forward to meet them, and taking the waiting-maid for his bride, he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal chamber.",
  "And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride.",
  "Was there -- yes, there was another cap!",
  "The very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew!",
  "They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.",
  "When he approached the bed the King spake to him: Most trusty John, I feel my end is drawing near, and I could face it without a care were it not for my son.",
  "Mighty well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.",
  "The wind wizard's son did this, and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening.",
  "Then he went to the bed where the girls lay; and, having found the boys ' little bonnets, Ah!",
  "But Prigio, very quietly asking for the head of the Firedrake, said he 'd pour the magic water on that, and bring the Firedrake back to life again, unless his majesty behaved rightly.",
  "The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself.",
  "He has no more heart than a flounder.",
  "said the hag, the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself, and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven.",
  "And, what was more, he had!",
  "So he commanded that everyone in the kingdom should come to the palace, and see if he could show the apple.",
  "But as soon as she was in the funnel, the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down, was too strong for her wings.",
  "As you have come of your own accord, you may stay.",
  "There he went and sat down on a rock, looking toward the sea, and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow.",
  "In the meantime the King, who had not the least idea of the sad thing that was happening outside the gate of his palace, proposed to Miranda that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town, which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches, placed in windows and balconies, and in all the grand squares.",
  "Can not the whole proclamation be annulled, and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up this flimsy scroll?",
  "Unfortunately, this man was very rough and unkind, and though the poor monster was quite quiet, he often beat him without rhyme or reason when he happened to be in a bad temper.",
  "She got up and dressed hastily, and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room.",
  "Little he cared, but left off crying his lamps, and went out of the city gates to a lonely place, where he remained till nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it.",
  "She never saw him, however, for he always came after she had put out her light, and went away before daylight appeared.",
  "and such a fine fellow he was.",
  "Just plain rose-coloured glass, Herr Spex, said Dick, I 'm not short - sighted.",
  "The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely, she answered.",
  "At this moment the butler, William, who had been in the queen's family when she was a girl, entered, and announced: Some of the royal tradesmen, by appointment, to see your Majesty.",
  "I took the place of servant here yesterday, said the Prince.",
  "How much are you to have then?",
  "Coward, lache, poltroon, runaway!",
  "said the mother, quite astonished.",
  "It would not matter so much, added the prince, only I had relied on making my peace with his majesty, my father, by aid of those horns and that tail.",
  "So he went into the drawing-room, took his carpet, and wished to be -- now where do you suppose?",
  "On going out of the town he found the white, red, and black dogs, and killed and burnt them, gathering the ashes in three bags.",
  "Everyone who met him stared and looked after him, for he was flying like a madman, and he could not have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night long.",
  "The Fountain of Lions is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle, the entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions, two of which sleep alternately, while the other two are awake.",
  "Many thanks, sire, replied the captain, I accept your offer.",
  "On the third morning after they had left their father's house they set about their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish.",
  "There was in the town a large dark gate, through which she had to pass night and morning with the geese; would he kindly hang up Falada's head there, that she might see it once again?",
  "She rang the bell, and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her, which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in.",
  "And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every particular the description given by the gardener's son, and, stepping on board, he continued his journey.",
  "Go then once more, and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my successor must certainly be married.",
  "The whole town must know about this; and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle, hemmed it, and embroidered on it in big letters, Seven at a blow.",
  "Take this sword, she said, and cut off my head!",
  "Then he said to them: Be not afraid, brothers; father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again, only follow me.",
  "Yes, yes, wait till to-morrow, said the giant, and then I myself will take you to her.",
  "let him alone; he is ever my most trusty John.",
  "Here is a sheep that can talk.",
  "The next morning the King came, and said: Well, now you 've surely learned to shudder?",
  "Two days afterward, when the Prince had gone to bed, the Fairy suddenly appeared to him and said: I promised your father that I would be your friend, and to keep my word I have come to bring you a present.",
  "He showed the fencing-master how to fence, and the professional cricketer how to bowl, and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers.",
  "answered the pert hussy, throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads.",
  "yes, answered number two: If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved.",
  "But the hut was as dirty and black inside as a pigsty, so the Master-maid said that she would smarten it up a little, that it might look a little more like what other people's houses looked inside.",
  "The Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went first.",
  "At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and transported the bed back to the palace.",
  "After looking at her he said, in a tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart, though he did not seem to be angry: Good-evening, old man.",
  "it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world.",
  "But I left Enrico somewhere about.",
  "But whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother, flying for her life from the wicked King, who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him!",
  "Then he awoke and cried out: Oh!",
  "On going to the first jar and saying, Are you asleep?",
  "Hold your prating, said the Ogre; they will eat the tenderer.",
  "He told his Majesty that it would be inconvenient to part with her, as, when she was gone, the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the ship -- but to oblige his Majesty he would fetch her.",
  "So away she went, but grumbling all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house.",
  "The Princess heard him, and sent out one of her slaves, who said to the old peddler: What will you take for your fish?",
  "But poor Molinda merely cried.",
  "In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her: ' I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition -- that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own.",
  "He signs himself ` Charles, P. W., ' said Ricardo, looking at the end.",
  "I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours.",
  "Come with me, madam, said the Sheep; I offer you a hiding-place which you only will know of, and where you will be mistress of everything you see.",
  "We are certainly discovered, said the Captain, and shall be undone if we can not find out who it is that knows our secret.",
  "And one after the other they all came, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long, long time Cinderlad's two brothers came likewise.",
  "When the Prince heard it, he was very sorrowful, and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden.",
  "with my wife, and fixed her in a good house; then taking leave of her and my boy and girl, with tears on both sides, I sailed on board the Adventure.",
  "For a moment the king was tempted; but then he said to himself: Never mind, it's only an extra penny on the income-tax.",
  "We shall not part till I have induced you to accept a sword which I can never hope to draw against another adversary so noble.",
  "The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey.",
  "Did n't you say Prince Charles gave you his own sword?",
  "I have often been in the forest; that is where I have seen you, lovely Princess, sometimes driving your chariot, which you did with all the grace and skill in the world; sometimes riding to the chase on so spirited a horse that it seemed as if no one but yourself could have managed it, and sometimes running races on the plain with the Princesses of your Court -- running so lightly that it was you always who won the prize.",
  "As for Lady Molinda, she was torn by the most painful feelings; for, much as she hated Prigio, she could not bear the idea of marrying Benson.",
  "Yet he could nowhere see the Remora.",
  "As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth, and tried to knock him down; but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near, and got out of the window again with a jump.",
  "Dick drank the wine, and then he told his miserable story.",
  "Now, reasoned King Prigio, if there is a Flying Horse at all, he is in the stables of the King of Delhi.",
  "From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.",
  "It was a lovely warm evening, and the French windows were wide open on the balcony, which looked over the town and away north to the hills.",
  "It was across the sea, he noticed that; but which sea, -- Atlantic, Pacific, the Black Sea, the Caspian, the Sea of Marmora, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the German Ocean, the Mediterranean?",
  "When you come out again I will teach you how to stop the hand-mill, which is useful for almost everything.",
  "Bring me, said his Majesty, Lord Lovat's snuff-mull.",
  "The Firedrake rose to the surface, his horns as red as a red crescent-moon, only bigger, and lashing the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail.",
  "Well, I don't mean to starve in the midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes!",
  "I have forgotten to see to the fire, she said.",
  "When he had done the Princess made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always.",
  "So they took Charming, and as a reward for having served the King so faithfully he was shut up in the tower, where he only saw the jailer, who brought him a piece of black bread and a pitcher of water every day.",
  "The king hastened to a window over the gate, and saw the sentinels on duty.",
  "When this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home, and landed at the harbor of his native land.",
  "The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.",
  "Some carried baskets full of diamonds, others golden cups of wonderful workmanship, and amber, coral, and pearls, others, again, balanced upon their heads bales of the richest and most beautiful stuffs, while the rest brought fruit and flowers, and even birds.",
  "I don't trust that younger one, said Dick, moodily; I don't care for that young man.",
  "And all the courtiers cried: Yes, you did; but some added, to themselves, He always says, ` Did n't I say so?",
  "Well, we asked him where he killed the Firedrake, and he said in a garden near Gluckstein.",
  "Some of them fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below.",
  "Go and get each of you a bow and arrow, and repair to the great plain, where they exercise horses.",
  "Little enough had she to take away with her.",
  "Princess, said he, you at least can never need this water, but I am an unhappy ambassador, whose death you desire.",
  "That great booby, Ricardo, saved her from wild birds, which were just going to eat her.",
  "No, not quite so very much, -- but I want them to like you.",
  "But do not let us pursue this sanguinary encounter in all its horrible details.",
  "The merchant, terrified by these furious words, dropped the fatal rose, and, throwing himself on his knees, cried: Pardon me, noble sir.",
  "The factor, in surprise, turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive.",
  "And then the prince told them, shortly, all about it: how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties, which had been given him at his christening; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them; and how, probably, the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go -- namely, to the king's Court at Falkenstein.",
  "The Princess and the Captain of the Guard were talking so earnestly that they did not think of Patypata, but she had overheard all they said, and now came and threw herself at Miranda's feet.",
  "cried the ambassador; and the prince, offering Lady Rosalind his arm, went out into the hall, where he saw neither his carpet nor the horns and tail of the Firedrake!",
  "Sire, she answered, having heard of your victories I thought that green would signify my joy and the hope of your speedy return.",
  "As he did so, his cap dropped off.",
  "Not much use in that, sir!",
  "They fell into each other's arms.",
  "Sire, said the Princess, to show that we constantly hoped for your success, and that the sight of you is as welcome to me as the sky with its most beautiful stars.",
  "And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that he killed the Firedrake -- for he must have got to Falkenstein by now, -- and they will be for marrying him to the king's niece, and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of Pantouflia!",
  "However, the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over.",
  "Moreover, he had abolished what is called compulsory education, or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not; a most mischievous and tyrannical measure!",
  "He admitted that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail, not for killing the monster.",
  "On which, taking leave of their Majesties and other great personages at court, they sailed with a fair wind for England, whither we must now attend them.",
  "We were just sitting down to dinner at Falkenstein, rather late, -- hours get later every year, I think -- when I heard a row in the premises, and the captain of the guard, Colonel McDougal, came and told us that a man had arrived with the horns and tail of the Firedrake, and was claiming the reward.",
  "After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised Mr. Whittington to send for the necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman, and made him the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself with a better.",
  "Thou art too late, oh Lord of the Earth and the Sea!",
  "Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from here, and how say est thou that thou slewest the molester, and earnest hither in a few hours ' space?",
  "Hasten, oh Pachacamac, for the shadow shortens!",
  "They were now in great affliction, for the farther they went the more they were out of their way, and were more and more bewildered in the forest.",
  "I was sure it was not so bad as you made it out, Dick, she said.",
  "But nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white head.",
  "To prove him again, the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it.",
  "The cable was about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.",
  "This unusual kind of rain, and the pleasantness of the whole place, would, no doubt, have attracted numbers of people to it, if the King of the Sheep had been of a more sociable disposition, but from all accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge.",
  "But cats do not look far into the future; and this old black cat -- Frank was his name -- had got a breakfast somehow, and was happy in the sun.",
  "Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk.",
  "She must have been in the room, invisible, said the king; and, of course, she has died in that condition.",
  "I 've had a splendid day with a sea-monster.",
  "Should he see Ricardo bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf?",
  "Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the coast, and taking off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water.",
  "They whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.",
  "He was made captain of the Sultan's armies, and won several battles for him, but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in peace and content for several years.",
  "Then he spoke: Take care, or I'll hang you up again.",
  "I wo n't detain you, but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace; follow my women, and they will show it you.",
  "This young man returned in a vessel which I fitted out for him, an unseaworthy ship with a black battered hull, and the sailors were infirm and crippled.",
  "Then the moon was darkened without a cloud, and there was darkness in the sky for a time, and all the dogs in the world began to howl.",
  "They all went in turn, first princes, and then knights, but none of them had a golden apple.",
  "The King was very angry, and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country; and at last, after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies.",
  "Then off he flew, and soon he reached the volcano of the Firedrake.",
  "Yes, now I know what shuddering is.",
  "I could turn myself into a dog or a cat, and go into the room where he is giving his orders.",
  "Then give me the eye, for perhaps I can see farther than you.",
  "And at the same time he changed himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.",
  "A year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met her death.",
  "I was the laborer's wife, and was a good nurse, and the Queen gave you into my charge, and told me all her misfortunes, and then died before she had time to say what was to become of you.",
  "And there was a little heap of grey ashes.",
  "But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off.",
  "Frisk, who was very small and could look closely into the water, cried out: I see a golden carp coming.",
  "No one, sire, answered the soldiers.",
  "I'll go and tell him you 're coming, said the prince; and with two strides he was over the frozen mountain of the Remora.",
  "The youth's name was Curdken, and the real bride was made to assist him in herding geese.",
  "Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word.",
  "I fancy there are plenty of long marches before me, and I would not be a spear's length behind the hardiest Highlander.",
  "In the third place, you must be provided with a bottle, which I will give you, to bring the water in.",
  "The horses of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy, having been daily led before me; and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, on a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious leap.",
  "They went the first day's journey together, and lay all at an inn, where the road was divided into three different tracts.",
  "certainly, answered the Fairy, and you also shall have supper directly.",
  "Many other ceremonies took place at my departure.",
  "King Prigio was not absent a minute, for he met William on the stairs; but when he came back, there was not one single person in the turret-room!",
  "As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit, she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people.",
  "Never heard of it, said Ricardo.",
  "We'll soon see, said the old man; if you are stronger than I then I'll let you off; come, let's have a try.",
  "I know that you are my mother's sister, and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages, and my nurse into a hen, and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that I shall marry your son.",
  "said he, and was filled with admiration at his own courage.",
  "Bellissima was sitting in the wood when you passed, and saw you with the Fairy of the Desert, who was so cleverly disguised that the Princess took her to be prettier than herself; you may imagine her despair, for she thought that you had fallen in love with her.",
  "The letters were very short.",
  "The Sultan, who was persuaded that there could not be any such thing as such a tent as he asked for, was in a great surprise at the Prince's diligence.",
  "The vulture flew instantly out of the window; and ah!",
  "He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.",
  "Which of them will you have, my dear?",
  "'\nBut he -- your man, I mean -- was not a bit put out.",
  "So the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life.",
  "It is in Latin, anyhow, I know.",
  "Prince Ahmed, too, did not come to Prince Ali's and the Princess Nouronnihar's wedding any more than his brother Houssain, but did not renounce the world as he had done.",
  "said the King; do you dare to call yourself the Princess's lover, and to lay claim to such a treasure?",
  "said the tailor, and chased the unwelcome guests away.",
  "Old as I am, replied the cobbler, I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now.",
  "So saying, the Fairy disappeared, leaving Prince Darling very much astonished.",
  "You may do that, said the Princess, for she had made up her mind what she would do.",
  "CHAPTER IV It was not long before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed for seizing the enemy's whole fleet.",
  "Consider yourself under arrest!",
  "It was so big, and fat, and fine a horse that Cinderlad had never seen one like it before, and a saddle and bridle lay upon it, and a complete suit of armor for a knight, and everything was of copper, and so bright that it shone again.",
  "In a moment these were provided; he bathed, dressed, drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the Firedrake, sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door of the English ambassador as the clocks were striking eight in Gluckstein.",
  "the queen wo n't be pleased at all.",
  "The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and asked his will.",
  "He is going to the cavern alone, though if he had a hundred men with him he could not succeed.",
  "But as we left home before dinner, and yours is over, may I request your lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take something cold?",
  "At any rate, for two months she need not decide, but could enjoy herself with her sisters.",
  "The poor Princess, seeing her lover lying dead at her feet, could no longer live without him; she sank down by him and died of a broken heart.",
  "As to the poor princess, she was sorrowful and angry enough about it.",
  "She saluted the King gracefully, while a murmur of admiration rose from all around.",
  "He took him up in his arms and carried him to his wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along with his sister, and in the room of little Day cooked up a young kid, very tender, which the Ogress found to be wonderfully good.",
  "The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come.",
  "At first he thought he was going into a dark, obscure place, but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of, and, entering into a large, spacious place, at about fifty or sixty paces distant, he perceived a magnificent palace, which he had not then time enough to look at.",
  "But ever since he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie, everything has been made too easy for him.",
  "cried the pretended Fairy, if you have fallen into her hands, you wo n't get away until you have married her.",
  "The two children seemed quite contented, and when their father died they wept for him, and divided his possessions as he had told them.",
  "The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate, and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada.",
  "The Wonderful Sheep begged that the Princess would consider herself queen over all that she saw, and assured her that, though for some years he had been very sad and in great trouble, she had it in her power to make him forget all his grief.",
  "I met him in a distant town reduced to carrying away dust and rubbish from the houses.",
  "The family gibbet, I presume, is in good working order?",
  "Then the flat, white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped, and slowly, like the movement of a sheet of ice, it slipped upwards and curled upwards, and up, and up!",
  "The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the kingdom for six weeks.",
  "However, it was impossible to refuse, and so she danced with the prince, and he danced very well.",
  "When the skipper had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long, for he was so afraid that the man would change his mind, and he had no time to ask how he was to stop it grinding, but got on board his ship as fast as he could.",
  "She filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil.",
  "In the secret chamber were found fifty wagon-loads of gold flax, and as much more was discovered buried.",
  "Father, replied the Princess, I will never marry the son of the minister.",
  "Was it not enough that I allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you?",
  "But I was taking a walk in the moonlight, on the balcony, and I observed it carefully.",
  "He at once found himself in Africa, under the window of the Princess, and fell asleep out of sheer weariness.",
  "When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise.",
  "what do I want with this coach and horses?",
  "And so that very day the gardener's son married the beautiful Princess.",
  "No, he answered; what can it be?",
  "As she did so, Ricardo's arm ceased to hurt, and the look of pain passed from his mouth.",
  "Now, Benson, William, and Thomas brought in the coffee, but the queen took no notice.",
  "But there are ways which they do not know, roads beyond the borders of the world.",
  "Then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move; and away it went, over rough and smooth, over stock and stone, so that they could scarcely breathe, and sometimes they were on the ground, and sometimes up in the air; and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinning-wheel, and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church.",
  "But, for heaven's sake, tell me where you got your riches from, said he to his brother.",
  "He took then a resolution, that he might save his own life, to cut the Queen's throat; and going up into her chamber, with intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great fury as he could possibly, and came into the young Queen's room with his dagger in his hand.",
  "suddenly exclaimed the monarch, in obvious excitement.",
  "Prince Alphonso, the third son, was round, fat, good-humoured, and as brave as a lion.",
  "We can not go back to our country; let us land on this desert island and there end our miserable lives.",
  "While the Princess was dressing the Princes went to throw themselves at the Sultan their father's feet, and pay their respects to him.",
  "In war, my weapon is the claymore.",
  "Then they told him that somewhere, a long way off, there dwelt three dreadful sisters, monstrous ogrish women, with golden wings and claws of brass, and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair.",
  "Now go and eat your supper, and await my orders.",
  "They were all met in the royal study, where the king made them a most splendid bow, and requested them to be seated.",
  "In a moment the square was empty, for the people rushed to give thanks in the temples.",
  "This is one that she liked very much: In the forest all is gay When my Princess walks that way.",
  "For you, madam, said Prigio in a stately way to Lady Molinda, in less than a week I trust we shall be taking our vows at the same altar, and that the close of the ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us brother and sister.",
  "Now, when the time drew near for her to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom, her old mother gave her much costly baggage, and many ornaments, gold and silver, trinkets and knicknacks, and, in fact, everything that belonged to a royal trousseau, for she loved her daughter very dearly.",
  "Do not get up to-morrow, he added, until you see the sun and hear a golden bell ring.",
  "The King's physicians at first laughed at the unknown wayfarer, but the Sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted.",
  "Now Semiramis was very fond of birds, and no sooner did Ricardo enter and flutter on to a table than Semiramis gathered herself together and made one fell spring at him.",
  "And sister Anne answered: I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.",
  "They entreated her to come in, but, seeing that she would not, left her, and the Prince, coming up, courteously greeted the maiden, and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary.",
  "They wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood.",
  "You are aware, he said, that Skyresh Bolgolam has been your mortal enemy ever since your arrival, and his hatred is increased since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is obscured.",
  "No, indeed, said she, I shall never forget; and as soon as she was at home the White Bear turned round and went back again.",
  "THE WHITE CAT Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead.",
  "I do not know, cried the poor woman, paler than death.",
  "Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything I wish for.",
  "All the prose and the poetry that was written just then was about Bellissima -- for that was the Princess's name -- and all the bonfires that they had were made of these verses, which crackled and sparkled better than any other sort of wood.",
  "There, too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall, boiling, exactly the same as in the two other rooms, and the Prince took pleasure in trying this also, so he dipped a lock of hair in, and it came out so brightly gilded that it shone again.",
  "several times, as loud as he could.",
  "The man tried to shove him away, but the youth would n't allow it for a moment, and, pushing him off by force, sat down in his place again.",
  "Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him.",
  "No sooner had he touched the ground than the Dwarf shouted: Hi!",
  "He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it.",
  "The Prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace, each with a lovely princess, and they came to meet him, asking if he had also found a wife.",
  "A king must hear both sides, said King James.",
  "So he mounted his horse and went to the bridge.",
  "While he was still writing he heard a voice which attracted his attention in spite of himself.",
  "Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her, promising, if he failed, to return and suffer death at the Sultan's pleasure.",
  "And, then, think how hard they made him work at school!",
  "He pulled the deer's foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air, each holding a torch.",
  "My greatest fear was for my eyes, which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperor's searchers.",
  "That I have, master; it was an amusing horse to ride, but I rode him straight home, and put him in the stable too, said the Prince.",
  "They are very old friends of our family, my dear, that's all, said the king timidly.",
  "And Ricardo has not seen her, whoever she may be.",
  "When he had finished he heard a great noise in the next room, which he knew meant that the Beast was coming.",
  "Some enchanter may have deprived it of its power, it may be worn out, someone may have substituted a common Persian rug; anything may happen.",
  "And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself.",
  "` Why, your majesty, ' says he, ' I just sat down on that there bit of carpet, wished I was here, and here I ham.",
  "The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life.",
  "For what reason did you leave the room without my permission?",
  "He took his horse two-thirds of the way up the hill, but then he turned back.",
  "If he is not, I am very much deceived.",
  "As to the old rug, said the upholsterer, I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home, at your Majesty's service.",
  "I 'm really glad to hear that, for I 've been looking for a wife all over the world.",
  "The Princess was so thirsty that she got down, bent over the stream, and drank, for she was n't allowed to drink out of the golden goblet.",
  "But never mind, one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long.",
  "No, my Prince, replied Celia; I can not help thinking you very handsome; but what good would riches be to me, and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me, if the bad deeds which I should see you do every day made me hate and despise you?",
  "but I will put a stop to that.",
  "But as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army of rats, who were guarding the straw bed; and when she attempted to approach it they sprang at her, biting and scratching furiously.",
  "But when you get there you must not even give yourself time to greet anyone, but go straight into the stable, and take the horses, and put them in the coach, and drive back as quickly as you can.",
  "However, I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals, who ventured to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was free, without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them.",
  "You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell.",
  "At midday the Prince and his men came to a deep river, spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time.",
  "And I think a girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant, without expecting to be married next day.",
  "CHAPTER II After about two hours the Court retired, and I was left with a strong guard to keep away the crowd, some of whom had had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as I sat by the door of my house.",
  "he is unjust to complain of me, when I have always treated him with love and respect.",
  "How horrid being too clever makes one!",
  "Yes, she's a dear, good girl, said the king; yet she looks melancholy.",

  "But remember it is the Sultan my father asks this favor.",
  "There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting.",
  "But I have n't the smallest need of your hundred horsemen; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two.",
  "I bet Dick is not far off, where there is an adventure on hand.",
  "But if I take your ring, my pretty shepherdess, said the Queen, you will have nothing left; and what will you do then?",
  "Give it to me, that I may see if I can do so.",
  "She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives.",
  "why wert thou not born to a private station?",
  "The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba's house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at to-morrow's market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in.",

  "for he was as brave as a lion.",
  "But the boy and his wife and his mother went back to the kingdom that was theirs, and lived long and happily after all their troubles.",
  "Then he remembered how, in an old Italian poem, he had read about all the strange lumber-room of odd things which is kept in the moon.",
  "He tried half-a-dozen different fly-hooks, but all to no purpose; he lost his temper, got his tackle entangled in Jaqueline's hair and then in the landing-net; and, though such a big boy, he was nearly crying with vexation.",
  "So the giant lay down to sleep again, and slept for a long, long time.",
  "The Fairy of the Desert, quite taken in by these words, resolved at once to transport the Prince to a pleasanter place.",
  "As soon as Prince Ahmed perceived the lady, he made all imaginable haste to go and pay his respects; and the lady, on her part, seeing him coming, prevented him from addressing his discourse to her first, but said to him: Come nearer, Prince Ahmed, you are welcome.",
  "Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle.",
  "So she seated herself on his back, and they did go so swiftly!",
  "Four-and-twenty pretty and graceful nymphs advanced toward him, holding garlands of flowers, with which they barred the way.",
  "At night the two brothers went home as they had done the night before, and told how things had gone, and how everyone had ridden, but no one had been able to get up the hill.",
  "When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and waited to see what would happen.",
  "You see it is not difficult to do if you really care for me.",
  "This new misfortune was the work of the wicked Fairy of the Desert, who had come with the Yellow Dwarf to help him carry off the Princess, and had fallen in love with the handsome young King of the Gold Mines directly she saw him.",
  "Now, Benson, William, and Thomas brought in the coffee, but the queen took no notice.",
  "Even now a great mass of rock fell from the roof deep down in the secret caves, and broke into flying fragments, and all the echoes roared and rang.",
  "Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice.",
  "But the second time she went into the room, happening to be tired, she sat down in one of the chairs, when instantly the curtain was rolled aside, and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her; there were dances, and colored lights, and music, and pretty dresses, and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies.",
  "So he called them to him, and said: Your mother brought me as her dowry two stools and a straw bed; I have, besides, a hen, a pot of pinks, and a silver ring, which were given me by a noble lady who once lodged in my poor cottage.",
  "cried the king, rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle.",
  "Look here, said the king, just you two younger ones look at Prigio!",
  "It used to tire me, I remember.",
  "The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him.",
  "They beat the serpent drums, for they had no bells, on the tops of the temples.",
  "The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our license under the great seal.",
  "At last he got tired of being constantly reminded, and wanted to be able to do as he liked, so he threw his ring aside, and thought himself the happiest of men to have got rid of its teasing pricks.",
  "said the ambassador, with perfect truth.",
  "So he was received with all honor, and given a special house of his own to live in.",
  "I 'm a widower, I am, said the Dwarf, though I 'm out of mourning, for he wore a dirty clay-coloured Yellow jacket.",
  "If you cut off his head, he went on just as before, only without it; and so about everything else.",
  "Perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for this, because, in fact, he saw no means of distinguishing himself by adventures just at that time.",
  "So now she was running for her very life, and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand.",
  "When they saw this portrait they fell in love with the Princess -- every one of them, but upon each it had a different effect.",
  "I have no fear, said she; and it was true.",
  "Then they sat out in the conservatory, among the flowers, where nobody came near them; and then they danced again, and then the Prince took her down to supper.",
  "when I asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood, he actually asked to be taught to shudder.",
  "cried poor Molinda, kneeling at the throne, where her streaming eyes and hair made a pretty and touching picture.",
  "The mob shot arrows back, some of them tipped with lighted straw, to burn the palace down.",
  "Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing: Let me see if it will not fit me.",
  "As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.",
  "In a hollow of the hill, sure enough there was the sword of Enrico, the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun.",
  "He spoke in the language of the ancient Incas of Peru, which of course Prigio knew very well; and he also knew that Pachacamac was the god of that people.",
  "Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down, and bending over the flowing water she cried and said: Oh!",
  "But, sir, said the ambassador, the streets are lined with soldiers; and I know not how you have escaped them.",
  "So the youth went to the King and spoke: If I were allowed, I should much like to watch for three nights in the castle.",
  "no, answered the young King; if I don't get in, it will be my certain destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes.",
  "And Dick alighted, and nestled in his breast.",
  "Have pity upon me, traveler, she said again.",
  "What could the girl do to save the life of two princes, the hopes of one nation, and of a respectable minority in another?",
  "It's most extraordinary, said his Majesty.",
  "The King was in despair about it, when a wise old man said to him: Your gardeners do not understand their business: but what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters?",
  "To-day you must go underground and fetch my taxes, he said to the Prince.",
  "May you soon have a better place, if you have come to serve here!",
  "How often must I tell you that there are no fairies?",
  "The maidens had dreamed that he was coming, and were ready to go with him, but first they made a cake in which they put poison, and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned.",
  "I should be very much amazed myself if I did not know you.",
  "Six hundred servants were appointed me, and three hundred tailors made me a suit of clothes.",
  "There's not much fun taking them, he said, when they are so silly.",
  "Now, my little pigmy, let me see you do that.",
  "Every evening after supper the Beast came to see her, and always before saying good-night asked her in his terrible voice: Beauty, will you marry me?",
  "I could also charm you with my gardens, but we will let that alone till another time.",
  "Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling.",
  "Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.",
  "These three adventures were the only ones of any consequence that befell Charming upon his journey, and he made all the haste he could to reach the palace of the Princess Goldilocks.",
  "I consent to your going, but, believe me, I can give you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing.",
  "He became very nervous, and at that moment Dick lighted on the crystal ball, and put his claw on the very hill where Jaqueline had disappeared.",
  "The king had some absurd story about your having been killed by a fabulous monster.",
  "He begins, ` Prins and dear Cousin!",
  "I seem to know that hand, said Ricardo; but I thought the fingers which held the pen had long been cold in death.",
  "Dick caught it out of his hand, and broke across his knee as fine a driver as ever came from Robertson's shop at St. Andrew 's.",
  "'\nshe cries to your butler; his majesty went on, ` perjured knave, thou liest in thy throat!",
  "Well, I have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it, and he says -- That he does not believe in Firedrakes, interrupted Prigio, The weather's warm enough without going out hunting!",
  "I swore to these articles with great cheerfulness, whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at full liberty.",
  "So the mill began to grind salt, till it spouted out like water, and when the skipper had got the ship filled he wanted to stop the mill, but whichsoever way he turned it, and how much soever he tried, it went on grinding, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, until at last the ship sank.",
  "He was carried before the Sultan, who ordered the executioner to cut off his head.",
  "As, for example, every time your Majesty goes into the field, you are obliged to be at a great expense, not only in pavilions and tents for your army, but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage.",
  "At least, if he fails, it will be most unusual, and Enrico can try his luck.",
  "Moreover, the steam and smoke, and the flames which the Firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils, would have daunted even the bravest man.",
  "At length all the horses were so tired that they could do no more, and so hot that the foam dropped from them and the riders were forced to give up the attempt.",
  "We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa.",
  "Felicia was hidden in the shade, too much astonished by all she saw to venture to move; but in a few moments the Queen said: I fancy I see a shepherdess near that tree; bid her come hither.",
  "cried the prince: his legs are giving way; he's groggy on his pins!",
  "Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams, and why the Prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances.",
  "The Prince followed, but could not overtake her.",
  "You have nothing else to do but to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine.",
  "-- Surprises THE prince said nothing, the ambassador said nothing, Lady Rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawing-room.",
  "The Prince suddenly remembered the gold-spinners, and said to himself: If I ride thither, who knows but that they could explain this to me?",
  "After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty.",
  "The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest.",
  "They knocked at the door, and a good woman came and opened it; she asked them what they would have.",
  "That's the very thing I came here for, he answered; I am quite ready to enter the King's service.",
  "As the three Princes were always submissive and obedient to the Sultan's will, and each flattered himself fortune might prove favorable to him, they all consented to it.",
  "I don't think it will get into the papers, said Jaqueline, smiling.",
  "I suppose you will tell us that you have watched well again this time, said the brothers.",
  "he cried; and he uttered the words of power, the magic spell that the dark Moon Lady had taught him.",
  "With a Sword of Sharpness and a Cap of Darkness, and so forth, you have a great pull over almost anything.",
  "What can I do, Prince, to make you happy?",
  "Under the cushion in the Princess's room.",
  "The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.",
  "Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody came to the poor children.",
  "The other fellow had a Flying Horse, said he.",
  "She has carried off more than one Prince like this, and she will certainly have anything she takes a fancy to.",
  "Nor was that strange, for the hill was as smooth as a glass window-pane, and as steep as the side of a house.",
  "Have you been for the tax?",
  "Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table, and the prince was much amused to hear the Fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak; especially he noticed one maid who, no matter what was being said, always contrived to praise her mistress's wisdom.",
  "The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two, that if he had a great deal of money, she would have him.",
  "After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key.",
  "It did not at once change into a beautiful young lady, as perhaps you expect; no, that was improbable, and, as the prince was in love already, would have been vastly inconvenient.",
  "Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: Just sit down there, children, and if you 're tired you can sleep a bit; we 're going into the forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we 're finished we'll come back to fetch you.",
  "The next day the attorney came riding by the place where the Master-maid dwelt.",
  "Must a powerful fairy like myself condescend to explain her doings to you who are no better than an ant by comparison, though you think yourself a great king?",
  "At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another explanation occurred to him.",
  "It is now quite a year since the maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge must hear her, yet no one comes to her aid.",
  "He stole away to the door, which was ajar, to see what was there, and a horse was standing eating.",
  "Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse, and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill, for the report of it spread far and wide, and there was no one who had not heard tell of it.",
  "It was all about the attitude of Pantouflia in the event of a Polish invasion of Russia.",
  "Well, you have a right to it, and I shall tell you.",
  "After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to Finland.",
  "The Queen kissed her, and said: Well, to please you, let me see what I can do for this cross Bruno.",
  "Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it to me.",
  "Then the youth shouted out to him the third time, and as that too had no effect, he made a dash at the spectre and knocked it down the stairs, so that it fell about ten steps and remained lying in a corner.",
  "each knight came alive, with his horse, and lifted his sword and shouted: Long live Prince Prigio!",
  "And you know, of course, that the drops are not ordinary silver?",
  "Next St. John's eve the man again said that he could not go on in this way, losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year, and that one of his sons must just go there and watch it, and watch well too.",
  "I came to fetch a pitcher of water for my pinks, madam, she answered, stooping to pick up the pitcher which stood beside her; but when she showed it to the Queen she was amazed to see that it had turned to gold, all sparkling with great diamonds, and the water, of which it was full, was more fragrant than the sweetest roses.",
  "She seemed prettier and kinder than ever.",
  "he said piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: Fear nothing, but obey me.",
  "She found it filled with the sweet scent of the pinks, and, going up to them, she said sadly: Beautiful pinks, you are so sweet and so pretty, you are the only comfort I have left.",
  "No, thought he to himself, I wo n't wish that.",
  "Beside it stood a figure horrible to see: a man clothed in serpent skins, whose face was the grinning face of a skull; but the skull was shining black and red in patches, and a long white beard flowed from beneath it.",
  "In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a silver cover, which we could not lift.",
  "Up there sprang a tall, white flame of fire, waving like a tongue of light; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful, strong, funny, black cat that ever was seen!",
  "You stupid, inquisitive goose!",
  "This was a thing which he disliked doing very much.",
  "But we return to Whittington, who could have lived happy in this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook, who must be always roasting and basting, or when the spit was idle employed her hands upon poor Whittington!",
  "When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as they could.",
  "Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.",
  "he continued, he was led away by flatterers.",
  "Since mine was another 's, I understand too well the feeling of yours!",
  "The queen, who did not believe in Firedrakes, alone took his side.",
  "This it is which makes him grieve so constantly.",
  "The Fairy of the Desert was delighted to hear them sing of her triumphs; she led the King into the most splendid room that can be imagined, and left him alone for a little while, just that he might not feel that he was a prisoner; but he felt sure that she had not really gone quite away, but was watching him from some hiding-place.",
  "The three Princes had nothing to say against the decision of the Sultan.",
  "One day when he had started at the very earliest dawn, and was riding over a great meadow, he suddenly had a capital idea, and, springing from his horse, he sat down under a willow tree which grew by a little river.",
  "and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill, and looked on at what followed.",
  "As he hesitated the Mermaid, who guessed his thoughts, said to him: You may trust me: I am not trying to entrap you.",
  "After that they went up into the two great rooms, where was the best and richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent ever were seen.",
  "Here he was safe; and so weary was he, that he put his head under his wing and fell fast asleep.",
  "The poor, trembling people of the country came out of their huts and accompanied Dick, cheering, and throwing roses which had been yellow roses, but blushed red as soon as the Dwarf expired.",
  "The boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured, and that, wanting them, he could only try and fail.",
  "When daylight began to appear, the bailiff was half dead; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf's tail, that he forgot the sack of money and all else.",
  "Harry, he cried to his brother, come here at once and let me present you to his Royal Highness, our illustrious ally, Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia.",
  "But Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal kindness, and she could think of nothing but to curtsy, and say: Please, your Majesty, the princess gave me the drops.",
  "I will give you a ship to take you back to your own country upon one condition.",
  "This good woman had never heard of the King's proclamation against spindles.",
  "Meanwhile Ricardo was riding gaily home.",
  "they exclaimed, and vowed that everything should be kept dark.",
  "The giants were terrified at the apparition, and, fearful lest he should slay them, they all took to their heels as fast as they could.",
  "After a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree, and snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze.",
  "So saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating, but what was her surprise when, in a lovely little glade quite surrounded by trees, she saw a large sheep; its wool was as white as snow, and its horns shone like gold; it had a garland of flowers round its neck, and strings of great pearls about its legs, and a collar of diamonds; it lay upon a bank of orange-flowers, under a canopy of cloth of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun.",
  "'\nThe King was very angry indeed when he heard this dream, and frowned horribly; indeed, he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry he was, and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry; but he could not forget his daughter's dream.",
  "You shall have a bit of one of my candles, which you can take away with you hidden in your breast.",
  "The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them.",
  "Now I have you, said the youth; this time it's your turn to die.",
  "But there was no one to give him an answer.",
  "He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done, but, the slower he went, the more time had everyone to stare and look at him; and they used it too, and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf.",
  "And when she saw that he was turning his horse back she threw one of the golden apples down after him, and it rolled into his shoe.",
  "But, fast as the Remora stole forward, the Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and clashing his fiery wings.",
  "Whereas, Our eldest son, Prince Prigio, hath of late been guilty of several high crimes and misdemeanours.",
  "Then the magician went back and related to the Sultan of the Indies all that had happened, and how very rich Prince Ahmed was since his marriage with the Fairy, richer than all the kings in the world, and how there was danger that he should come and take the throne from his father.",
  "THE TERRIBLE HEAD Once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl.",
  "So Felicia took up her pitcher and ran to her little room, but while she had been away Bruno had gone in and taken the pot of pinks, leaving a great cabbage in its place.",
  "Strangely enough, it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault, but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed.",
  "So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before, but much finer, and himself more magnificently mounted, equipped, and dressed, and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction.",
  "Do you think you are going to break with impunity the promise that you made to my friend the Yellow Dwarf?",
  "Good-day to you, young traveler, said she.",
  "There in a blue cave of the ice he found the Three Gray Sisters, the oldest of living things.",
  "When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess!",
  "Now he was a very handsome and powerful Prince, who had been in love with the Princess for years, but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all.",
  "She gave them each a bit of bread and said: There's something for your luncheon, but don't you eat it up before, for it's all you'll get.",
  "At night he came back, and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought; it must have been at least six bushels, and he set it down on the bench.",
  "The Queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another little door in the orange tree, but presently it opened and she found herself in a field of thistles and nettles.",
  "She was a prisoner in this great gleaming hall, ending in black nothingness.",
  "The Queen, your mother, has promised you in marriage -- Has promised me!",
  "You may seat yourself on my back, and then I will carry you to him.",
  "Then the two Dreadful Sisters who were left wakened, and rose in the air like great birds; and though they could not see him because of his Cap of Darkness, they flew after him up the wind, following by the scent through the clouds, like hounds hunting in a wood.",
  "The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand.",
  "The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan.",
  "In a moment Prince Ricardo's foot was on the blade of the diamond sword, which he passed thrice through the body of the Yellow Dwarf.",
  "What will you give me if I spin it for you?",
  "Where's the good of it, he used to ask, all that stamping, and posture-making, and ha - haing?",
  "The Princess was very sorry, but as Grabugeon was really dead, she allowed the Captain of the Guard to take her tongue; but, alas!",
  "The hut belonged to an old crone, who was also an ill-tempered and malicious troll.",
  "But the secret of making it has long been lost, except in Pantouflia.",
  "The Captain of the Guard begged Miranda to come down into the garden where the King was enjoying the fresh air, and when they got there, he pretended to search for him, but as he was not to be found, he said: No doubt his Majesty has strolled into the forest, and he opened the little door that led to it and they went through.",
  "When daylight came in the morning, the Princess with the long nose came too, and once more drove her away.",
  "How do you happen to know about him?",
  "Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread.",
  "He told her he loved the Princess so deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask her in marriage of her father.",
  "Pray explain your plan, said Prince Charles.",
  "I think I see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth!",
  "Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more but only for his diversion.",
  "And in what part of the globe is Ethiopia, Ricardo?",
  "And remember, you don't stir without my permission.",
  "Let me have the satisfaction of dying for you, my Princess, said he.",
  "Then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape.",
  "But the truth was she was afraid lest the horse should speak and tell how she had treated the Princess.",
  "Yet thou must hasten, for it draws near to noon.",
  "Well, said Rosalind, putting her head on his shoulder, and speaking very low, I want everybody to love you as much as I do.",
  "So, as soon as they reached the place, she gave him back his sight, but without releasing him from his chains, and by her magic power she appeared before him as a young and beautiful fairy, and pretended to have come there quite by chance.",
  "The next morning by break of day, after they had embraced and wished each other good success, they mounted their horses and took each a different road.",
  "So they determined to go home to the Prince's father, but the Prince would on no account permit the Master-maid to walk there, for he thought that it was unbecoming either for her or for him to go on foot.",
  "said the White Bear; if you will, you shall be as rich as you are now poor.",
  "When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference.",
  "And when they went back again the coach went quicker still, so that most of them did not know how they got back to the palace at all.",
  "Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant.",
  "She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: Fetch me something to eat!",
  "So the three mice made themselves a boat and set sail for the magician's country.",
  "Often and often they have been godmothers to us.",
  "Here, take a glass of port, and explain how all this happened.",
  "Of course she had the best of teachers, the Fairy Paribanou herself; but very few girls, in our time, devote so many hours to practice as dear Jaqueline.",
  "The next day the gardener's son heard a great noise in the street, and the King's heralds passed, blowing all kinds of instruments, and crying: The King, our master, is old and infirm.",
  "The prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the road.",
  "So the boy thanked her, and he fastened on the Shoes of Swiftness, and turned to say good-by to the young man and the lady.",
  "Moreover, though I had taken away his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace.",
  "The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before.",
  "He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood.",
  "At last, after a long time, came a knight riding upon a horse that was such a fine one, its equal had never yet been seen.",
  "If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed.",
  "THE STORY OF PRINCE AHMED AND THE FAIRY PARIBANOU There was a sultan, who had three sons and a niece.",
  "She is the Princess of the Golden Roof, answered Trusty John.",
  "I have killed seven at a blow, slain two giants, led a unicorn captive, and caught a wild boar, then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my door?",
  "She only answered that she was very much obliged to the King, but she had no wish to be married.",
  "When Prince Ahmed saw the pavilion which the Fairy called the largest in her treasury, he fancied she had a mind to jest with him, and thereupon the marks of his surprise appeared presently in his countenance; which Paribanou perceiving burst out laughing.",
  "Miranda reached her father's palace just as the wedding ceremony began, and everyone, as soon as she came in, was struck with surprise at her beauty and the splendor of her jewels.",
  "At his entrance into it he admired the infinite number of sconces of wax candles perfumed with amber, the multitude of which, instead of being confused, were placed with so just a symmetry as formed an agreeable and pleasant sight.",
  "No, not if you have money.",
  "He had lost strength, no doubt: for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds, and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter; but so did the roars of the Firedrake.",
  "William stammered, and seemed at a loss for a reply.",
  "Whereas, Our eldest son, Prince Prigio, hath of late been guilty of several high crimes and misdemeanours.",
  "Charming thanked her with all his heart, and joyfully hastened back to the town.",
  "Seizing the Wishing Cap, he put it on, wished all the tradesmen, including the shoemaker, back in the town at their shops, and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair.",
  "I'll never deceive him again, never... unless it is quite necessary, said the princess to herself.",
  "Nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about, not eating the grass, but some drinking coffee, lemonade, or sherbet, others eating ices, strawberries and cream, or sweetmeats, while others, again, were playing games.",
  "So the Princess would sit looking up at the sky, and watching the clouds float across, and wondering whether she should ever get out of her prison.",
  "Well, you will see her quite soon enough, said the giant.",
  "And the King and Queen made much of the boy, and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter.",
  "Then he took one of the old black-leather bottles, and ran downstairs again to the place where he had burned the body of the poor old sick cat.",
  "Charming, quite determined to get the water or die, now drew his sword, and, taking the crystal flask which Pretty Goldilocks had given him to fill, said to Frisk: I feel sure that I shall never come back from this expedition; when I am dead, go to the Princess and tell her that her errand has cost me my life.",
  "He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps, and had a crown of pinks on his head.",
  "In about a month I was ready to take leave.",
  "My whole fortune depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?",
  "My subjects loved me, my neighbors envied and feared me.",
  "Do you wish me to prove what I say?",
  "I am a king's son, he said, and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free.",
  "They went quite mad with delight: enemies kissed in the streets; and all the parents, without exception, allowed all the young people who happened to be in love to be married that very day.",
  "OF all the people who did not like Prigio, his own dear papa, King Grognio, disliked him most.",
  "I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.",
  "But there is another thing -- that eclipse of the moon!",
  "Aladdin's mother, when she came to herself, said: Whence comes this splendid feast?",
  "He changed clothes with her, colored his face like hers, put on her veil, and murdered her, that she might tell no tales.",
  "She was then four years old, and came up to him jumping and laughing, to take him about the neck, and ask him for some sugar-candy.",
  "he closed the door and went home.",
  "They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.",
  "In despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part, stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; but turn which way he might, he never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it.",
  "One day when this keeper was asleep a tiger broke its chain, and flew at him to eat him up.",
  "And so she did, and the marriage was celebrated the very next day with the utmost splendor, and Beauty and the Prince lived happily ever after.",
  "These cats will eat every one of us, she said, if the captain of the ship does not shut the ferocious animals up.",
  "Find the ring and give it to him, said the Princess.",
  "And she ran to her own room, and brought a beautiful golden casket, which contained her medicines.",
  "The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry.",
  "Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not be in any pain about him.",
  "If I persist, I doubt not but he will use violence.",
  "in heaven's name what are you doing here?",
  "The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met, and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.",
  "But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give.",
  "The Beast considered for a moment, and then he said, in a less furious tone: I will forgive you on one condition -- that is, that you will give me one of your daughters.",
  "He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus they lived for many years.",
  "So soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out: Well, daughter?",
  "said the Giant, coming up smiling.",
  "When dinner was over, and when the nurse had brought in the baby, all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents.",
  "Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at last, tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room smaller than the rest, where a clear fire was burning and a couch was drawn up closely to it.",
  "the Giant asked again, and stared at Jaqueline in a perplexed way.",
  "The princess was glad he was riding, for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp; and a wasp, of course, could not have kept up with him in his Seven-league Boots.",
  "Prince, answered the Fairy, will you not pledge your faith to me, as well as I give mine to you?",
  "The King of the Sheep, with the help of all the flock, got up balls, concerts, and hunting parties, and even the shadows joined in all the fun, and came, making believe to be their own real selves.",
  "He ate cold pastry, and poached eggs, and ham, and rolls, and raspberry jam, and hot cakes; and he drank two cups of coffee.",
  "This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone.",
  "One would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks!",
  "Thus, through the great friendship of the secretary the affair was arranged.",
  "It was as fiat as the head of a skate-fish, it was deathly pale, and two chill-blue eyes, dead-coloured like stones, looked out of it.",
  "The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the real bride the worse horse, and so they continued their journey till at length they arrived at the palace yard.",
  "There, too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall, bubbling and boiling, but there was no fire under this either.",
  "As soon as she was in sight he rushed to meet her, leaping and bounding like a real sheep.",
  "The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could, then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness.",
  "The lad has come to some purpose and forethought, the king said, and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles ' eggs, which can rarely be got quite fresh.",
  "Everybody wore bridal favours, all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids, and such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been witnessed.",
  "My poor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only take care you don't burn your fur.",
  "Accordingly, she collected nine different kinds of enchanters ' nightshade, added some salt, which she first bewitched, and, doing all up in a cloth into the shape of a fluffy ball, sent it after them on the wings of the wind, saying: Whirlwind!",
  "The Sultan received and embraced them with the greatest joy, both for their return and the recovery of the Princess his niece, whom he loved as well as if she had been his own daughter, and who had been given over by the physicians.",
  "In a little time the creaking began again, and the earth quaked so that all the hay flew about the boy.",
  "I shall soon lay hold of you, spoke the monster.",
  "The wife ran and found her husband who was lying groaning in a corner, with his leg broken.",
  "All right, old fellow, says Alphonso; but have you any luncheon with you?",
  "The natives came by degrees to be less fearful of danger from me.",
  "As she was doing this, they said to her: Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?",
  "Just turn old Dobbin's head, and trot back to your mammy, Queen Rosalind, at Pantouflia.",
  "Then the Prince went back into his room again, and began to hum and to sing.",
  "You need not be afraid that she will change her mind, said the Fairy, throwing off the hermit's robe in which she had been disguised and appearing before them.",
  "But when he reached the room in which Celia had been locked up, he was greatly surprised to find that she was not in it, though he had the key in his own pocket all the time.",
  "The merchant bustled up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout; instantly opened the door, and who should be seen waiting but the captain and factor, with a cabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading, for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage.",
  "It is indigestion, he said to himself: those sausages were not of the best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong.",
  "But you have a heart, said the Queen.",
  "King Prigio stood with the mighty mass poised in his hands.",
  "The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda: Madam, my cousin, said he, your clemency will excuse my answer, and you will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct.",
  "So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out.",
  "Remember, he would eat no salt with you, and what more would you have?",
  "When they reached the capital they landed and ran to the palace, leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of the boat.",
  "why are you so unkind to me?",
  "However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifted up his hands in admiration.",
  "The prince ran upstairs to dress.",
  "my Lord Marquis, cried the King, and does this castle also belong to you?",
  "I am delighted, said he to the Queen, that, as you are to be my mother-in-law, you should see the little house in which your Bellissima will live with me.",
  "My father -- Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he was hungry!",
  "Let somebody make me fresh garlands of flowers, and give me my high-heeled shoes and my fan, and tell them to sweep my great hall and my throne, for I want everyone to say I am really ` Pretty Goldilocks.",
  "She gave it a push with her foot, saying: What are you doing here, and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of pinks?",
  "But Goldilocks was so fond of Charming that she could not be happy unless he was near her, and she was always singing his praises.",
  "His lordship did so; and I remained alone, in great perplexity.",
  "As to your present, though I am paid for my trouble by the seller, I shall receive it as a favor, and be very much obliged to you, and thankful.",
  "I have hold of it now, cried the bailiff.",
  "The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before.",
  "They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit hung, gave the branches into the tailor's hand, and bade him eat.",
  "Well, I'll tell him, said Jaqueline.",
  "Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could not take it out hunting with him.",
  "He was obliged to continue his expedition all the summer, and as soon as he departed the Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law to a country house among the woods, that she might with the more ease gratify her horrible longing.",
  "Four of his courtiers, those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings, had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them, but the people, who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince, had cut off their heads, and had offered the crown to Suliman, whom the Prince had left in prison.",
  "We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall.",
  "At last they were within striking distance; and the Firedrake, stooping from the air, dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora.",
  "But, before that could be done, King Prigio, mounted on the palace balcony, made a long but very lucid speech to the assembled people.",
  "Toward evening the giant came home.",
  "She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home: Cassim, your brother is richer than you.",
  "After them came the youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity.",
  "How stupid people are not to see their own faults!",
  "From Pantouflia, sir, said Prince Charles; why, that is hundreds of leagues away!",
  "He ordered his coach to wait at a distance, and desired that I would give him an hour's audience.",
  "While they were talking the night fell, and then, to their great surprise, wonderful colored lights began to shine in all directions, and splendid fireworks blazed out before them; all the forest was illuminated by them, and even felt pleasantly warm, though it had been bitterly cold before.",
  "Then he was led upstairs, and he made his bow to the pretty lady, who, of course, made him a magnificent courtesy.",
  "Let us also remember -- otherwise the scene would be too painful for an elegant mind to contemplate with entertainment -- that the Giant was in excellent training, and thought no more of a few wounds than you do of a crack on the leg from a cricket-ball.",
  "I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up, hoping that when you grew up he might love you, and by your care be restored to his natural form.",
  "They sat down on the grass, and Ricardo showed them how he meant to manage it, just as he had told Jaqueline.",
  "While she was thus pretending to be sorry for the King, he suddenly noticed her feet, which were like those of a griffin, and knew in a moment that this must be the Fairy of the Desert, for her feet were the one thing she could not change, however pretty she might make her face.",
  "The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before.",
  "Oh, yes; your man said he had killed the creature in a garden, quite near Gluckstein.",
  "When he saw the Prince so downcast he asked what was the matter, and when he explained that he could not bear Celia's bad opinion of him, and was resolved to be a better man in order to please her, this evil adviser said to him: You are very kind to trouble yourself about this little girl; if I were you I would soon make her obey me.",
  "Early next morning, as she and Curdken were driving their flock through the gate, she said as she passed under: Oh!",
  "Yet, cowardly as he was, he had not quite the heart to kill the Princess and her baby outright, but he had them put in a huge brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea, that they might either be drowned or starved, or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way.",
  "Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home.",
  "I 'm quite broken down and desperate.",
  "When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside.",
  "So that evening, when the Princess came once more with her sleeping-drink, he pretended to drink, but threw it away behind him, for he suspected that it was a sleeping-drink.",
  "When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order, and me pulling at the end, they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe.",
  "The first words he spoke were: Oh!",
  "Run, run, said the Queen; I am impatient to see the dear creature.",
  "So he took them home, and was very kind to them, and brought up the boy till he was a young man.",
  "So she opened the window, and asked what she would take for it.",
  "They placed the coffin on the ground, and he approached it and took off the cover.",
  "Do your duty; for me, Prigio est prêt; -- for this was his motto, and meant that he was ready.",
  "Before the three days had passed I wrote a letter to my friend the secretary telling him of my resolution; and, without waiting for an answer, went to the coast, and entering the channel, between wading and swimming reached the port of Blefuscu, where the people, who had long expected me, led me to the capital.",
  "Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while.",
  "Dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken, and in ten minutes was back, bearing a large ram's - horn snuff-box, with a big cairngorm set in the top, and the Frazer arms.",
  "Now Trusty John was his favorite servant, and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully.",
  "In the evening when the goose-girl came home he called her aside, and asked her why she behaved as she did.",
  "how my hand does hurt, and I 've got such a headache!",
  "Charming replied that he was perfectly willing to go, and would set out the very next day.",
  "You have despised my counsel, and have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a man; really you are a monster -- the horror of everyone who knows you.",
  "Yes, my sultaness, my queen, I'll give you my heart without the least reserve.",
  "I can say no more, beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I could not have foreseen.",
  "What is the matter, lovely Princess?",
  "said the attorney; sit still, I will do it.",
  "But afterwards he used to say that the moment when the Earthquaker stirred was the most dreadful in his life.",
  "From time to time, indeed, one regains his own proper form and goes back again to his place in the upper world; but the other beings whom you saw are the rivals or the enemies of Ragotte, whom she has imprisoned for a hundred years or so; though even they will go back at last.",
  "I desire that the golden ship shall turn to black wood, and the crew to hideous negroes; that St. Nicholas shall leave the helm and that the only cargo shall be black cats.",
  "That same evening the gardener's son rode up to the fountain upon his lame gray horse.",
  "I believe you mean what you say.",
  "said he, but he did not look up this time any more than he had done the first time, for he was still half asleep.",
  "He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest.",
  "On Christmas Eve he was so poor that he came to me and begged for a trifle, for God's sake, and now he gives a feast as if he were both a count and a king!",
  "If you don't know, my dear, said Queen Rosalind, his illustrious consort, I can't see what is to be done.",
  "Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!",
  "he cried, taking her hand in his; but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent I should have told you long ago how dearly I love you.",
  "He went and made a present of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren.",
  "With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang: The hands you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey; If your heart dreads not conquering Love, In this place you may fearlessly stay.",
  "Come in, then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can tell you my story in a very few words -- for I don't like endless tales myself.",
  "Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.",
  "THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILOR One summer's day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits, and sewed for dear life.",
  "Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth, flat, shiny coils; and still the head was higher than the rest; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer, like Death.",
  "I must really speak to Dick, which he did next morning after breakfast.",
  "But the prince made a great effort; he moved, and in two steps he was far away, down in the valley where it was not so very cold.",
  "This she will consent to do, for she does not know that it is you who let them fall on it; but no one can wash them out but one born of Christian folk: it can not be done by one of a pack of trolls; and then I will say that no one shall ever be my bride but the woman who can do this, and I know that you can.",
  "The tradesmen examined the objects, each choosing that in his own line of business.",
  "I amused the Emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner.",
  "And where shall I find one?",
  "He then hunted about in the lumber-room again till he found a small, shabby, old Persian carpet, the size of a hearthrug.",
  "child, she said, I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it.",
  "And because he had a tender heart, he put up a ladder, which he climbed unhooked one body after the other, and took down all the seven.",
  "Now they'll roll along better, said he, and houp-la!",
  "He was thunderstruck, and turning to the Vizier said: What sayest thou?",
  "But we keep his Majesty the Inca waiting, said Prigio.",
  "If you can trust me with this cross till to-morrow, Rosina, I should like to have it examined and analysed.",
  "He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears.",
  "When his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours, he was still alone; but a little table, upon which was a good dinner, had been drawn up close to him, and, as he had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, he lost no time in beginning his meal, hoping that he might soon have an opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer, whoever it might be.",
  "They must feel very secure against robbers, he said to himself.",
  "I see no more My Love, who yet my sadness cheers.",
  "The beautiful things will always remain beautiful, and the ugly things become lovely.",
  "The little tailor, who had only pretended to be asleep, began to call out in a clear voice: My lad, make that waistcoat and patch those trousers, or I'll box your ears.",
  "-- why, she would think him a mere braggart.",
  "You have certainly been talking with my Master-maid, for you never got that out of your own head, said the giant again.",
  "The Princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her arms round his neck; but Aladdin put her away, bidding her leave him, as he had more to do.",
  "Now, might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man's hand, and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather?",
  "Now, the King had some quarrelsome neighbors, who, tired of leaving him in peace, began to make war upon him so fiercely that he feared he would be altogether beaten if he did not make an effort to defend himself.",
  "Imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and the bronze ring was nowhere to be found!",
  "The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel.",
  "But the king was not ill-pleased: for, thought he, of course my three sons must go after the brute, the eldest first; and, as usual, it will kill the first two, and be beaten by the youngest.",
  "When he got there he went into the barn and lay down, but in about an hour's time the rumbling and creaking began, and it was frightful to hear it.",
  "He heard one swallow say to another: Come, let us fly to Finland; we can build better nests there.",
  "Here are fifty dollars for you, set forth into the wide world with them; but see you tell no one where you come from or who your father is, for I am ashamed of you.",
  "Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom, he said to him, you must do another deed of valor.",
  "There, too, was a portrait of a beautiful lady, sound asleep: this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant, also an ancestress of the royal family.",
  "He went to find out little Day, and saw him with a little foil in his hand, with which he was fencing with a great monkey, the child being then only three years of age.",
  "who is the original of the beautiful picture?",
  "Then, from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth, black hill, -- a chink no deeper than that under a door, but a mile wide, -- stole out a hideous head!",
  "Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said: Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?",
  "Luxurious beggar, whoever he is, said Ricardo.",
  "The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine.",
  "Her heart is buried, if I may say so, with poor Alphonso.",
  "So saying, he threw himself at her feet and held her by her robe.",
  "His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.",
  "if it gets no worse than that I can manage to stand it, thought Cinderlad.",
  "When the day began to dawn, and he had power to throw down the shovel, he did not stay long where he was, but ran away as fast as he possibly could; and everyone who met him stared and looked after him, for he was flying as if he were mad, and he could not have looked worse if he had been both flayed and tanned, and everyone wondered where he had been, but for very shame he would tell nothing.",
  "Now I don't budge from the spot till you have opened the door.",
  "The next day the sorcerer, tied to the tail of a savage mule loaded with nuts, was broken into as many pieces as there were nuts upon the mule's back.",
  "I congratulate you, sir; Molinda is a dear girl.",
  "'\nAnd in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them.",
  "In the debate on this charge, my friend continued, his Majesty often urged the services you had done him, while the admiral and treasurer insisted that you should be put to a shameful death.",
  "At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: Get up, you lie-abeds, we 're all going to the forest to fetch wood.",
  "So she began to walk as fast as she could, but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue; look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest, and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King running after her to kill her.",
  "The giant read: Seven at a blow; and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain, he conceived a certain respect for the little man.",
  "In the meantime the Prince's companions sought him far and wide, but to no purpose, so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the King, who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him.",
  "So he was on his feet in a moment, and out in the porch.",
  "Beg of him to be satisfied in knowing you are happy, and desire no more; and let him know that the sole end of your visit is to make him easy, and inform him of your fate.",
  "So in came Charming, who presented her with the ring and said: Madam, I have done your bidding.",
  "And nothing was done to the scoundrel.",
  "He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down.",
  "The ground was strewn with bodies of the slain, and through them Prigio rode slowly into the courtyard, where the Inca was sitting in the dust, weeping and throwing ashes on his long hair and his golden raiment.",
  "What were you doing, little man?",
  "But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat's skin!",
  "But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet, and flew away without looking behind.",
  "As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest.",
  "All's well that ends well, he said, lighting a fresh cigar, for he had allowed the other to go out in his excitement, but it was a fight!",
  "The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, but the woman had died.",
  "How she does go on about my nose!",
  "After a time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?",
  "The captain landed upon the shore and began to explore the country.",
  "Then he took off the stained handkerchief, and, lo, there was not even a mark where the wound had been!",
  "I can tell you all you want to know better than she could.",
  "So they lived happily in a happy country, occasionally visiting Manoa; and as they possessed the magical Water o Life from the Fountain of Lions, I do not believe that any of them ever died at all, but that Prigio is still King of Pantouflia.",
  "Every day when she got up she meant to say it at night, and when night came she put it off again, until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind.",
  "However, next day he started, with a spear, a patent refrigerator, and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out.",
  "The genie appeared, and at the magician's command carried him, together with the palace and the Princess in it, to a lonely place in Africa.",
  "On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King's palace, and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride, and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister.",
  "He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese, and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair, that glittered like gold, and repeated: Wind, wind, gently sway, Blow Curdken's hat away; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold Now astray and hanging down, Be combed and plaited in a crown.",
  "The manikin took the ring, and whir!",
  "Son, replied the Sultan of the Indies, I should be very sorry if what I ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more.",
  "Lord Kelso rang the bell, and in came all the servants, with William, the under-butler, at their head.",
  "These young men had never cared for any one else.",
  "He spoke to the boy, and asked him why he was so unhappy; and the boy told him how he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head, and knew not how to begin to set about the adventure.",
  "They scarce dared to speak or turn their heads.",
  "Then all at once she saw before her the Yellow Dwarf.",
  "Do not be uneasy, said Abdallah; go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars.",
  "Knowing Ali Baba's poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure.",
  "By this time the daylight had begun to appear, and the Princess, looking at her conductor, saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad to speak.",
  "Turning round, he saw a frightful Beast, which seemed to be very angry and said, in a terrible voice: Who told you that you might gather my roses?",
  "And I should have fallen, dear Rosalind, if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you.",
  "No, I don't know what to do with Dick, said the king.",
  "Young people will be young people, said the queen.",
  "She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him.",
  "Aladdin, knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his command.",
  "At this instant the King of the Sheep came back to her, and was so distracted to find her in tears that he could have torn his wool.",
  "A king's word can not be broken.",
  "Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave.",
  "The King caused an escort suitable to her rank to be got ready for her, and she dressed herself splendidly, not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful.",
  "So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode for a long, long way, and at last she came to the mountain, where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding-comb.",
  "look how those two there are fighting for the golden apple, said the King's son.",
  "Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place.",
  "As for you, old man, he added, turning to the merchant, at sunrise to-morrow you will take your departure.",
  "If all this be true, added the Sultan, you see that I must have recourse to other means to determine certainly in the choice I ought to make among you; and that, as there is time enough between this and night, I'll do it to-day.",
  "If I do not slay the Earthquaker, sacrifice me to your gods.",
  "Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil.",
  "The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with music and cheers.",
  "I simply can't shudder, he said, and it's clear I sha 'n' t learn it in a lifetime here.",
  "Then, turning to Felicia, she said: Charming Princess, I know all the hen told you, but you can not have heard that the zephyrs, to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the Queen, your mother, so anxiously waited for him, left him instead in a garden of flowers, while they flew off to tell your mother.",
  "It is often confusing to wake in a strange bed, much more so when you have flown through the air, like the king, the queen, and Benson the butler.",
  "Take this new-married man, he said, and put him outside in the cold, and return at daybreak.",
  "But he said he would never give them the eye till they told him the way to the Fairies of the Garden.",
  "Neither of them said Good-night to the prince.",
  "said the King, would you make my life horrible to me by marrying another before my eyes?",
  "Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long, replied Curdken; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities, and said: Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse's head that hangs on the wall: ` Oh!",
  "At last he said: Well, if you wo n't tell me, confide your trouble to the iron stove there, and he went away.",
  "His sons and daughters, who had been very uneasy at his long absence, rushed to meet him, eager to know the result of his journey, which, seeing him mounted upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a rich mantle, they supposed to be favorable.",
  "She took them both by the hand and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them -- milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts.",
  "Capital, he said, only a little quicker.",
  "what a ninny my brother is!",
  "Why, the sea where the girl is, has turned all red as blood!",
  "And now I must make my preparations.",
  "The mice withdrew in great dismay.",
  "Ask not, but eat, replied Aladdin.",
  "Prisoner though he was, the King of the Sheep had still some powers and privileges.",
  "'\nThese were her very words.",
  "I can not believe that he meant to deceive us.",
  "But don't be concerned, let what will be devised against you; be persuaded that I will deliver you out of all the snares that shall be laid for you.",
  "You have certainly been talking to my Master-maid, for you never got that out of your own head, said the giant.",
  "It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it.",
  "Which of us deserves the most credit?",
  "He blessed the moment that he thought of seeking after his arrow a second time, and, yielding to his love, Madam, replied he, should I all my life have the happiness of being your slave, and the admirer of the many charms which ravish my soul, I should think myself the most blessed of men.",
  "King's son, said the White Cat, I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them.",
  "When day broke the youth put the fifty dollars into his pocket, set out on the hard high road, and kept muttering to himself: If I could only shudder!",
  "I 'm ever so late, he said, hurrying upstairs; and the princess, with a little sigh, went down to the royal drawing-room.",
  "There can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.",
  "And don't you go muffing them with the landing-net, Jack, as you generally do, said his Royal Highness, as he lit his bedroom candle.",
  "The merchant knew that this was meant for them, and Beauty, who was rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and seen nothing of the Beast, was quite willing to begin, for her long ride had made her very hungry.",
  "said he, is that all the thanks I get?",
  "Now, said the Dwarf, I am master of my rival's fate, but I will give him his life and permission to depart unharmed if you, Princess, will consent to marry me.",
  "So he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy, and this was his plan: A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married, and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her.",
  "Set out early to-morrow morning, and when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you, which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle.",
  "The King's son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer.",
  "It was an awul sight to behold!",
  "All the King's unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair.",
  "Some people are; and it does grow rather tedious in the long run.",
  "Others, That all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there their sabbath or night's meeting.",
  "The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it, but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again, and said: See, he's actually burning the King's bridal shirt.",
  "And because she was so beautiful, and because her hair was like the finest gold, and waved and rippled nearly to the ground, she was called Pretty Goldilocks.",
  "We don't know, your lordship.",
  "As you like, said the king, who knew what was in her mind very well.",
  "So she talked across the fairies to the king, just as if they had not been there; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which, of course, they were.",
  "Three years after my leaving him my good master, Mr. Bates, recommended me as ship's surgeon to the Swallow, on which I voyaged three years.",
  "It seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so smoothly that Beauty was not frightened; indeed, she would have enjoyed the journey if she had not feared what might happen to her at the end of it.",
  "Then Trusty John answered: I will never desert him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life.",
  "He was awakened by the return of the king, who threw himself on a sofa and exclaimed: Oh, that Prime Minister!",
  "The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house, and, guilty or not, was always in the wrong; he was, notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together; and, if he spake little, he heard and thought the more.",
  "In these times, you must know, princesses learned magic, just as they learn the piano nowadays; but they had their music lessons too, dancing, calisthenics, and the use of the globes.",
  "said Ricardo, unlocking the door.",
  "He shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our express order, at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours ' warning to keep within doors.",
  "madam, cried the clerk of the kitchen.",
  "You may sit upon my back, and then I will carry you there.",
  "'\nI 've heard of Robert Bruce, said Dick; he was the man who did not kill the spider, but he cracked the head of Sir Harry Bohun with one whack of his axe.",
  "Get up, and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves.",
  "He had now some difficulty in getting rapidly over the ground, and stood mainly on the defensive, and on his waist.",
  "I lay in the barn till the sun rose, but I saw nothing and heard nothing, not I, said the boy.",
  "Go at once and invite the captain of the ship to come to the palace.",
  "Then the prince was shown his own room, where he locked up the hoofs, the carpet, the cap of darkness, and his other things in an iron box; and so he went to bed and dreamed of his Lady Rosalind.",
  "Thus speaking, the king, with another magnificent bow, led the way upstairs to a little turret-room, in a deserted part of the palace.",
  "CINDERELLA, OR THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen.",
  "I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.",
  "But the youth said: No matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that's what I 've set out to do.",
  "Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled.",
  "Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do.",
  "Ali Baba's wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content.",
  "Ah, my poor country, when I am gone, what may not be your misfortunes under Ricardo!",
  "There he alighted, and there he found the Three Fairies of the Garden.",
  "St. Nicholas will be at the helm.",
  "The Dwarf took in the affair at a glance.",
  "After some time, however, a gentleman who came to his master's house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes.",
  "All the Court cried: Long live Queen Miranda!",
  "The prince had certainly not come well out of the adventure.",
  "She scowled, and was very cross, but the Master-maid did not trouble herself about that.",
  "groaned the father, you'll bring me nothing but misfortune; get out of my sight, I wo n't have anything more to do with you.",
  "Presently the boy and his mother and his wife set sail for his mother's own country, from which she had been driven so unkindly.",
  "But your base and malevolent nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty.",
  "He looked round, and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat, and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains; for the Firedrake was coming!",
  "He had n't to search long, for the unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the tailor, dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot.",
  "my dear daughter, he cried, kissing her, can you ever forget my cruelty?",
  "Beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have it, but she did not see anyone or hear a sound, and, though her father had warned her that she would be alone, she began to find it rather dull.",
  "my most trusty John, pardon!",
  "Without seeming to have noticed anything, he said, in a confidential way: Not that I have any dislike to the Fairy of the Desert, but I really can not endure the way in which she protects the Yellow Dwarf and keeps me chained here like a criminal.",
  "Then the prince was shown his own room, where he locked up the hoofs, the carpet, the cap of darkness, and his other things in an iron box; and so he went to bed and dreamed of his Lady Rosalind.",
  "He then presented her to the Queen, who started back, and was afraid to touch a creature who had made such havoc among the rats and mice; however, when the factor stroked the cat and called Pussy, pussy!",
  "She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador, and her name was Lady Rosalind.",
  "So he laid his piece of bread in the girl's hand, and saw her eat it up eagerly.",
  "Tell me how it all happened, Dick, said the princess; I 'm sure it's not so bad as you make out.",
  "Here his Majesty sighed, and seemed plunged in thought.",
  "Poor Beauty, much distressed, said to them: I have, indeed, caused this misfortune, but I assure you I did it innocently.",
  "he cried; why do you scream?",
  "In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; everyone thought upon their particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready to die for hunger.",
  "I put his lordship into my coat pocket, and, giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one, I fastened the door, placed my visitor on the table, and sat down by it.",
  "She always wore a crown of flowers, and her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls, and everybody who saw her fell in love with her.",
  "Well, here was the prince in a pretty plight.",
  "And has Holy Church, asked the Duke of York, with anxiety, given her sanction and her blessing to those instruments of an art, usually, in her wisdom, forbidden?",
  "But, though the gardeners were many and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits, not even grass or shady trees.",
  "The Sword of Sharpness is enough for me.",
  "In fact, he knew everything better than anybody else; and the worst of it was that he did: and he never was in the wrong, and he always said, Did n't I tell you so?",
  "But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower.",
  "As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars.",
  "No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their babies ' noses several times every day to make them grow long.",
  "Then all the multitude looked up, and seeing the Flying Horse, let their weapons fall; and the man of the skull tore it from his face, and knelt before King Prigio, with his head in the dust.",
  "Go down, said the magician; at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls.",
  "LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature was ever seen.",
  "it makes one shudder, the youngest sat in a corner, heard the exclamation, and could not understand what it meant.",
  "said he; what long nails you 've got!",
  "I am, said the Prince, ready to make you all imaginable reparation for the scandal I have thrown on you if you will make the truth of what you advance appear, and as he had the ivory pipe in his hand, after he had looked at the two glasses he said: Show me at which of these ends I must look that I may be satisfied.",
  "He is extremely poorly, blood rushing from his open jaws.",
  "said his majesty, where were you off to?",
  "He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer.",
  "Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.",
  "We think he have been come for!",
  "The poor creature was lean, and its fur had fallen off in patches; it could no longer catch birds, nor even mice, and there was nobody to give it milk.",
  "What on earth am I to do with the young man?",
  "Now you do the same, said the giant, if you really wish to be thought strong.",
  "However, Jaqueline is on the watch, and I'll show them a girl can do more than people think, -- as, indeed, she could.",
  "But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out of his wallet, and displayed them in open Court.",
  "Ricardo had very bad sport, when suddenly the trout began to rise all over the lake.",
  "no, said Miranda; only I am not used to living with sprites and with sheep that talk, and everything here frightens me.",
  "Otherwise, how could he meet his lady?",
  "One of the Prince's favorite companions was his foster-brother, whom he trusted entirely; but he was not at all a good man, and gave Prince Darling very bad advice, and encouraged him in all his evil ways.",
  "The butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda; because, as he justly remarked to William, here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again.",
  "If I had not changed the rug, the merest accident, Prince Charles would have dined at St. James's to-night, and King George in Hanover.",
  "Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; he walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which he went into; and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had passed through them.",
  "Beauty, you are only just in time to save his life.",
  "While he was washing the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out: Help!",
  "But this, of course, the prince did not know.",
  "And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt.",
  "For his part, he, very good-naturedly, showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein, the city where they were going; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography, nor the general of the army, knew anything about the matter -- which, indeed, they did not.",
  "at him, good lions, at him!",
  "The very thing, he said, and laid himself down in it.",
  "Such a handsome sheep, who was so polite and considerate, could hardly fail to please, especially if one knew that he was really a king, and that his strange imprisonment would soon come to an end.",
  "In good faith, cried the mother, I must send my child thither.",
  "I really wish, Ricardo, that you would attend to your geography a little more.",
  "It is quite true, said the king, and therefore I thought it best to bring Dick up on fairy books, that he might know what is right, and have no nonsense about him.",
  "Well, King's son, she said, here you are once more, without a crown.",
  "Such costly soup is not to be had in my father's palace, said the Prince; but everything depends on how it tastes, and then he went into the third room.",
  "Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father's Court, and the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou, who did not expect him so soon.",
  "I am not making fun of you, said a voice, answering Prince Darling's thoughts.",
  "It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines; we are not critics, but historians.",
  "The prince rode and rode, sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle; passing through forests, sleeping at lonely inns, fording rivers, till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow.",
  "I know my own defects, I hope.",
  "Besides this, six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.",
  "But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them out of his wallet, and displayed them in open Court.",
  "I would return good for evil, he said to himself, and save the unhappy man's life.",
  "cried the mother, in horror, you are very likely sleeping with a troll!",
  "Go, and let him be shut up in my great tower to die of hunger.",
  "If anyone were to taste that his throat would be gilded, said the youth, and then he went into the next chamber.",
  "King Prigio's secret, why he sent for the tailor and the other people, was his own secret.",
  "After Prince Houssain had run through that division, street by street, his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen, he was very much tired, which a merchant perceiving, civilly invited him to sit down in his shop, and he accepted; but had not been sat down long before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of tapestry on his arm, about six feet square, and cried at thirty purses.",
  "Then he got angry, and said: If you are n't careful yourselves, then I can't help you, and I don't mean to burn with you; and he hung them up again in a row.",
  "When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked: What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?",
  "-- Do you know what he meant to do, if he could not find his brothers?",
  "Oh, how I should have liked to see him too!",
  "Now, as Pantouflia was a rich, lazy country, which hated fighting, this was very unpleasant, and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better.",
  "The man she is betrothed to is one of my servants.",
  "Do you know what you are asking?",
  "Now they can't, because they are afraid of you; for you are so awfully clever.",
  "Instantly his ring pricked him sharply, as if it had been a pin.",
  "See here, opening the false merchant's garment and showing the dagger; see what an enemy you have entertained!",
  "He must have been swallowed by the brute, and cut him up inside.",
  "The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard.",
  "But no, that could not be.",
  "The next St. John's eve it was the same thing, once again: neither of the two brothers dared to go to the outlying field to watch the crop, but Cinderlad went, and everything happened exactly the same as on the previous St. John's eve: first there was a rumbling and an earthquake, and then there was another, and then a third: but all three earthquakes were much, very much more violent than they had been the year before.",
  "The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.",
  "They made a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two children.",
  "Seeing that the waves were rolling in higher than ever, he looked all round, and presently saw a lovely lady floating gently toward him upon the crest of a huge billow, her long hair spread all about her; in one hand she held a mirror, and in the other a comb, and instead of feet she had a beautiful tail like a fish, with which she swam.",
  "The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for clothes, had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother, who did not believe in them.",
  "How could they when they knew that any of them might have cut off his head five or six times a day just to please her, and she would have thought it a mere trifle, so little did she care?",
  "These people received our countrymen with civility, and therefore the captain, in order to trade with them, showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board, and sent some of them to the King of the country, who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace, which was about a mile from the sea.",
  "And as they passed a brook she called once more to her waiting-maid: Pray get down and give me a drink from my golden cup, for she had long ago forgotten her maid's rude words.",
  "The horse that fell was strained in the shoulder; but the rider was not hurt, and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could.",
  "shepherdess, said the hen, don't kill me; I am rather a gossip, and I can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear.",
  "He traveled on for some days, and presently reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a stone.",
  "Take great care of this ring, she said: it is more precious than diamonds; every time you do a bad deed it will prick your finger, but if, in spite of its pricking, you go on in your own evil way, you will lose my friendship, and I shall become your enemy.",
  "thought the boy, is it thou who eatest up our hay in the night?",
  "There is a prince not far from here whose name is Galifron, who once wanted to marry me, but when I refused he uttered the most terrible threats against me, and vowed that he would lay waste my country.",
  "At last, however, the bride's sister rolled an apple across the yard to him, and said: As you wo n't eat anything else, you may like to take a bite of that, for you must be both hungry and thirsty after your long journey.",
  "Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest.",
  "I am only too happy to assist so adventurous a prince, remarked the Great Mogul.",
  "A king's word can not be broken.",
  "Then he cried in terror: Dear Mr. Bear, spare me!",
  "Then the little tailor jumped down.",
  "Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps, and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight.",
  "Then Prigio brought back all the maidens, one after the other, and Dick last; and he fell at the Inca's feet, and requested leave to marry Jaqueline.",
  "Then he entered the room again, and bidding her leave the stove, he ordered royal apparel to be put on her, in which she looked amazingly lovely.",
  "Meanwhile, the prince, safe on his hill, was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him.",
  "The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon.",
  "we thought you were never going to come back.",
  "When he was near the top of a hill he dismounted to let his horse graze, while Frisk amused himself by chasing flies.",
  "But when he had looked on for half-an-hour, and only a river ran where the Remora had been, while the body of the Firedrake lay stark and cold, he hurried to the spot.",
  "The little man took the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the bobbin was full.",
  "Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the ogre 's, had a mind to go into it.",
  "He informed us that he had just killed the beast, and showed us the horns and tail, sure enough; there they are!",
  "The Princess found Charming such an agreeable companion that she sometimes said to him: Why did n't we stay where we were?",
  "Given at our palace at Belfaburac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.",
  "As he had, however, six sons and six daughters, he found that his money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied, as they were accustomed to do.",
  "My dear father, he replied, I will gladly learn -- in fact, if it were possible I should like to learn to shudder; I don't understand that a bit yet.",
  "He had a lion's head, a bull's horns, a wolf's feet, and a snake's body.",
  "They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.",
  "Very interesting, said the king.",
  "I 've very little to be proud of, really, said Dick, blushing; anyone could do as much with my fairy things, of which, no doubt, you have heard.",
  "Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall have nothing left to wish for.",
  "But just now his first care was for Celia, and rising into the air he flew round and round the house, until he saw an open window; but he searched through every room in vain.",
  "And he lays it down on that there seat, and Thomas shows him into the droring-room.",
  "And he grinned; for he fancied it was all nonsense, and that there were no Firedrakes.",
  "There was quite a troop of them, in all sorts of armour -- Greek and Roman, and Knight Templars like Front de Boeuf and Brian du Bois Gilbert -- all the brave warriors that had tried to fight the Remora since the world began.",
  "The said Man-Mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high roads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn.",
  "Dick now began to fly about the room, brushing the king's face and trying to attract his notice.",
  "Well, then, I will go all alone by myself, said Cinderlad.",
  "'\nAnd Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed, and how he had always to chase his hat.",
  "I believe the Fairy is laughing at me, he thought.",
  "said the king, solemnly; then he cried: Lead me to the Inca; this day you shall not perish.",
  "At this dreadful sight I drew my sword and rushed at Ragotte, and should certainly have cut off her head had she not by her magic arts chained me to the spot on which I stood; all my efforts to move were useless, and at last, when I threw myself down on the ground in despair, she said to me, with a scornful smile: ' I intend to make you feel my power.",
  "Oh, cried the Prince, not one of you is good for anything at all!",
  "Punctuality is the politeness of princes!",
  "The messenger remained standing by the sleeper, and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, when he tendered his proposal.",
  "So he went into the first room.",
  "He bade her keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold.",
  "So he took out his steel for striking fire, and threw it over the horse's mane, and the beast stood there as quiet as a lamb.",
  "Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up.",
  "I do wish I could see the thing myself, said he.",
  "Late as usual, you young dog!",
  "Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her.",
  "The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: What a poor wretched little creature you are!",
  "I love you already better than anyone in the world, she said; but now it is time to go back to your father, and we shall hear what he says about it.",
  "As for the glass, said the optician, if your Majesty will allow me to take it home with me -- I am afraid I can not part with it, said the king; but that, too, is unimportant, or not very pressing.",
  "So the Queen took the ring and put it on her finger, and mounted her chariot, which was made of coral studded with emeralds, and drawn by six milk-white horses.",
  "But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time, and then must go back to the Beast's palace for ever, they lamented loudly.",
  "It is no more than right, he said; for had I gone first, neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen.",
  "My name, sir, is Lady Molinda, she said, very proudly; and you have sent your own brother to his grave!",
  "Secondly: By attending an unseemly revel in the town of Gluckstein, where he brawled in the streets.",
  "The prince pulled off the cap of darkness, put on the other, and said: I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and gold, with the royal Pantouflia diamonds!",
  "If you are really good enough to wish to do me a favor, I beg that you will become his friend.",
  "He was always good-tempered and polite.",
  "A month after Prince Ahmed's return from paying a visit to his father, as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince, since the time that he gave her an account of his journey, his discourse with his father, and the leave he asked to go and see him often, had never talked of the Sultan, as if there had been no such person in the world, whereas before he was always speaking of him, she thought he forebore on her account; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day: Prince, tell me, have you forgot the Sultan your father?",
  "He looked all about the room, but saw nothing.",
  "Whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain, with tears in his eyes, for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and mice as much as ever.",
  "While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.",
  "On the morning of the third day the giant again had to go into the wood with the goats.",
  "Wouldst not thou be glad, my dear, to have the same gift given thee?",
  "No, no, my little Grabugeon, replied Miranda, I can not bear the thought of taking your life.",
  "said the giant, and if you have I will wring your neck.",
  "These are even better than pebbles, said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel said: I too will bring something home, and she filled her apron full.",
  "Then when she asked him why, and what good she had done him, he told her all the story; and how, before he fell in love with her, he did n't believe in fairies, or Firedrakes, or caps of darkness, or anything nice and impossible, but only in horrid useless facts, and chemistry, and geology, and arithmetic, and mathematics, and even political economy.",
  "When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting.",
  "The King, her father, gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning, and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of their sight!",
  "So I suppose the rest of the butler's tale is true, which I regret; but a king's word is sacred, and he shall take the place of that sneak, Prigio.",
  "Then, taking Jaqueline up on one hand, on which she sat as if on a chair, he crossed a few ranges of mountains in as many strides.",
  "However, he said nothing, and presently, when his hunger began to be appeased, the Fairy said: My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more that way, for your nose casts such a shadow that I really can not see what I have on my plate.",
  "But he began to feel rather bored.",
  "Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself.",
  "How happy they were as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together, sometimes listening to sweet music!",
  "You shall judge yourself whether I am or no, when I have told you its property and I hope you will value it at as high a price as those I have showed it to already, who had as bad an opinion of me as you.",
  "His voice was shrill, but very clear.",
  "` Evil is wrought by want of thought, ' said the king, quoting the poet.",
  "It was already beginning to be late in the day, and to church they must and would go, so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress.",
  "But the prince made a great effort; he moved, and in two steps he was far away, down in the valley where it was not so very cold.",
  "Guarded in this manner, he arrived at the capital of the Indies, but the lions never left him till they had conducted him to the gates of the Sultan's palace; after which they returned the same way they came, though not without frightening all that saw them, for all they went in a very gentle manner and showed no fierceness.",
  "'' Then when she asked him why, and what good she had done him, he told her all the story; and how, before he fell in love with her, he did n't believe in fairies, or Firedrakes, or caps of darkness, or anything nice and impossible, but only in horrid useless facts, and chemistry, and geology, and arithmetic, and mathematics, and even political economy.",
  "I come, a king to a king, he said.",
  "In a moment these were provided; he bathed, dressed, drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the Firedrake; sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door of the English Ambassador as the clocks were striking eight ' in Gluckstein.",
  "So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp.",
  "'\n` Who complains of my coldness in this dismal place?",
  "-- he refused to keep his royal promise, and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship!",
  "Sleepy old chap you are, Enrico, said the prince; but come on, Alphonso will have finished the grub unless we look smart.",
  "He could not help admiring everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him, though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump.",
  "She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in this matter.",
  "One offered a purse which could never be empty; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots; and another a cap of darkness, that nobody might see the prince when he put it on; and another a wishing-cap; and another a carpet, on which, when he sat, he was carried wherever he wished to find himself.",
  "I loved your father as if he had been my brother.",
  "I put five of them into my coat pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a face as if I would eat him alive.",
  "Where in the world have you been?",
  "For the first time he realized how long it really was, and exclaimed: Well, it must be admitted that my nose is too long!",
  "The Princess clasped her husband in a long embrace.",
  "Overcome with gratitude, the keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service; but suddenly a voice said in his ear: A good action should never go unrewarded, and at the same instant the monster disappeared, and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog!",
  "in Greek, Latin, Egyptian, French, German, and Spanish, -- all of which the prince perfectly understood, and spoke like a native.",
  "For he could not carry his bride through the air, so he took the Shoes of Swiftness, and the Cap of Darkness, and the Sword of Sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills.",
  "Punctuality is the courtesy of kings.",
  "Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in.",
  "The King had this proclaimed in every church in the whole kingdom, and in many other kingdoms too.",
  "The barometers stood at Set Fair.",
  "Her name was Celia, and she was as good as she was beautiful.",
  "But the father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.",
  "At this very moment there was a whizz in the air: something shot past them, and, through the open window, the king, the queen, Benson, and the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador's drawing - room!",
  "Well, Dick, but how do you mean to do it?",
  "From every temple top came the roar of beaten drums, great drums of serpentskin.",
  "With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches, and cold minced-collop sandwiches, he pricked forth into the wilderness, making for the country inhabited by the Yellow Dwarf.",
  "So she made up her mind that she would go and consult the Fairy of the Desert about it, especially as she had often heard how wise she was, and she thought that at the same time she might ask her advice as to whether it would be as well to be married, or not.",
  "The Princess gave a cry of terror on seeing the Dwarf, but this only irritated the little monster; muttering a few magical words he summoned two giants, who bound the King with great chains of iron.",
  "You must have read about him, sir, the Yellow Dwarf.",
  "There seemed no end to it at all; and it moved horribly, without feet, holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill.",
  "And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life came back, and Trusty John stood once more safe and sound before him.",
  "said the second gray woman.",
  "But the Firedrake, too, was in an unhappy way; for his legs were now cold and black, his horns were black also, though his body, especially near the heart, glowed still like red-hot iron.",
  "It was in his power, by sitting on his tapestry, to be at the place of meeting that very day; but, as he was obliged to stay there for his brothers, as they had agreed, and as he was curious to see the King of Bisnagar and his Court, and to inform himself of the strength, laws, customs, and religion of the kingdom, he chose to make a longer abode there, and to spend some months in satisfying his curiosity.",
  "When the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom, and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled; then she held a white rag under them, and letting three drops of blood fall into it, she gave it to her daughter, and said: Dear child, take great care of this rag: it may be of use to you on the journey.",
  "His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut.",
  "I am not faithless or to blame for what has happened.",
  "And, as for the Earthquaker, said her Majesty, I never was really anxious in the least, for I knew no beast in the world was a match for you, my dear.",
  "Now, as I think of retiring into the country, it seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very good company for me; so, without any regard for your ages, I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once.",
  "Then the King consulted his ministers.",
  "As he could do nothing to escape his visit, the only thing that remained was to seem as little afraid as possible; so when the Beast appeared and asked roughly if he had supped well, the merchant answered humbly that he had, thanks to his host's kindness.",
  "We are certain that there are Earthquakers, otherwise how can we account for earthquakes?",
  "When they awoke at last it was pitch dark.",
  "Any fellow with a waggon could bring the horns and tail; the difficult thing was to kill the monster.",
  "What was worse, he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month.",
  "When they had sat down his Majesty said: My dear Jaqueline, I never interfere with your pursuits, but I almost doubt whether Cornelius Agrippa is a good book for a very young lady to read.",
  "But very soon he arrived at the palace with the giant's head, of which she was still terrified, though it could no longer do her any harm.",
  "I am glad you are frank, Jaqueline.",
  "In short, he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the Princes his younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it.",
  "What unholy pranks are these?",
  "I am coming, answered his wife; and then she cried, Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see anyone coming?",
  "He was floating about in a sea of molten lava, on the top of a volcano.",
  "Done with you, he answered; I'll soon put an end to the giants.",
  "And immediately the Princess's cotton dress became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles, and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds, from which floated a clear white veil.",
  "Frisk heard him and said: My dear master, don't despair; the luck may change, you are too good not to be happy.",
  "They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf.",
  "It's me, answered the prince.",
  "After this the Princess could think of nothing but the roc's egg, and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor.",
  "What are you doing there, goody?",
  "You will not need any chariot to bring you back.",
  "Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst.",
  "How about my boots, I wonder, said the prince; for his seven-league boots were stout riding-boots, not good to dance in, whereas now he was in elegant shoes of silk and gold.",
  "At last the prince spoke: This is a very strange story, Lord Kelso!",
  "But there they remained, under the chestnut tree, sitting on the carpet above the flowery grass.",
  "And when at last she did begin to dream of her beloved Prince she was grieved to see him stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.",
  "Now the King had been very anxious to have a son, or at least a grandson, to come after him, but he was told by a prophet whom he consulted that his own daughter's son should kill him.",
  "The king rushed to the crystal ball, looked all the world over; but no princess!",
  "They are moon silver, and that can only be got in one way, so far as I know, at least -- when one spills the water when he, or she, is drinking the moon.",
  "Nor none of us can't, said the swordmaker.",
  "What a desperate fellow I am!",
  "For if the fairy water from the Fountain of Lions can bring you back to life -- why, there is a chance for Alphonso and Enrico!",
  "Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy's largest men-of-war after me.",
  "Here they were placed, according to the custom of the country, on rich carpets, flowered with gold and silver; and the King and Queen being seated at the upper end of the room, dinner was brought in, which consisted of many dishes; but no sooner were the dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant.",
  "Her majesty and I rose and went into the outer court, where we found, sitting on that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand, a respectable - looking upper servant, whom I recognised as your butler.",
  "` Then he takes the libbuty of sitting hisself down on his royaliness's rug, and he says, asking your pardon, ' I 've had about enough of service here.",
  "The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what manner she should dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, she went up, and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their blood.",
  "After this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and beautiful lady, who said to her: Dear Beauty, try not to regret all you have left behind you, for you are destined to a better fate.",
  "Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to his father's house, where he was received with abundance of joy.",
  "When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left.",
  "He presently considered that the Princess Nouronnihar could never be his and that the Fairy Paribanou excelled her infinitely in beauty, agreeableness, wit, and, as much as he could conjecture by the magnificence of the palace, in immense riches.",
  "Do not be afraid, said the Wonderful Sheep; I entreat you to have patience, and listen to the story of my misfortunes.",
  "The eldest of the Princes was called Houssain, the second Ali, the youngest Ahmed, and the Princess, his niece, Nouronnihar.",
  "Your quarrel is with me only.",
  "In the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different sizes.",
  "May I inquire the reason which offers me the pleasure of this unexpected interview?",
  "I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened; and in half an hour she spied me, and discharged a gun.",
  "Do you really mean what you say, Prince?",
  "Then the waiting-maid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes, and to put on her common ones, and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word about the matter when they reached the palace; and if she had n't taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.",
  "I could not marry a frightful giant as tall as a tower, who eats up people as a monkey eats chestnuts, and who talks so loud that anybody who has to listen to him becomes quite deaf.",
  "And he made a feast to which he invited them all, and they all brought their presents; some brought gold cups, and some brought necklaces of gold and amber, and some brought beautiful horses; but the boy had nothing, though he was the son of a princess, for his mother had nothing to give him.",
  "Every man has one secret from his wife, and this shall be mine.",
  "In saying this he was touching a weak point in his brother's character; for the Prince's fear of losing any of his power made him at once abandon his first idea of trying to be good, and resolve to try and frighten the shepherdess into consenting to marry him.",
  "The good woman, having drunk, said to her: You are so very pretty, my dear, so good and so mannerly, that I can not help giving you a gift.",
  "The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, a woman's beauty was a different thing; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a tip-tilted nose!",
  "The Inca, her father, has a claim on us to this preference.",
  "'\nYou can imagine how all her maids scurried this way and that to make the Princess ready, and how in their haste they knocked their heads together and hindered each other, till she thought they would never have done.",
  "But beforehand, I desire you to forgive me, and consider that you yourself have reduced me to this extremity.",
  "Yes, I will attend to that, said the Prince, and stayed sitting where he was the whole day, for it was soon settled between them that they would marry each other, he and the King's daughter; so the first day of his service with the giant did not seem long to him.",
  "The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound.",
  "Who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery?",
  "asked the king of the family executioner, a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet, who was only employed in the case of members of the blood royal.",
  "So they took a sad farewell of each other, and the Princess stuck the rag in front of her dress, mounted her horse, and set forth on the journey to her bridegroom's kingdom.",
  "When that too had no effect it occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each other; so he put him into the bed, covered him up, and lay down beside him; after a time the corpse became warm and began to move.",
  "The youth seized the axe, cleft the anvil open, and jammed in the old man's beard.",
  "And then the Mermaid caught up the King, and away they swam joyfully together.",
  "After dinner, in the conservatory, Jaqueline told King Prigio all about it.",
  "yes; so far as that is concerned, I am not ill off, said the sheriff.",
  "Indeed, sire, said the swordmaker, all the rest of us are bachelors.",
  "One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my freedom, Reldresal, the Emperor's secretary for private affairs, came to my house, attended only by one servant.",
  "Let the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until thou comest to a mountain ash tree on the left bank.",
  "The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy; and a bright tear rolled down on Frank's face, and made him rub his nose with his paw in the most comical manner.",
  "Accordingly they all set out at the same gate of the city, each dressed like a merchant, attended by an officer of confidence dressed like a slave, and all well mounted and equipped.",
  "All this was done in a moment.",
  "Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again, for, as he came, he took care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets.",
  "Presently, I shall wake up in my own bed at Falkenstein.",
  "The very spits at the fire, as full as they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also.",

  "The King's son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.",

  "Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts, particularly to the Court of France, to seek out everything rare and precious to adorn the Princess, although her beauty was so perfect that nothing she wore could make her look prettier.",
  "'\nSo the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince, said the White Cat, when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in.",
  "You see, she did not believe in fairies, nor in her own eyes, when she saw them.",
  "On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word, and asked his Vizier's advice, who counselled him to set so high a value on the Princess that no man living could come up to it.",
  "The prince sat down, and thought and thought; and the day went on, and it was now high noon.",
  "His ring pricked him very often, and sometimes he left off what he was doing at once; but at other times he would not attend to it.",
  "As he spoke he heard a voice calling: Charming, Charming!",
  "Oh waters white, where the moon is riding, That knows what shall be and what has been, Tell me the secret the heart is hiding, Wash me the truth of it, clear and clean!",
  "On no other condition will I have her.",
  "Indeed, I owe you more gratitude than you ever owed me, replied Charming.",
  "Do ye know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children?",
  "Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother's bed.",
  "Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it.",

  "The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they told her, and when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large.",
  "But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf, and must go out to put it in the byre.",
  "Now, when I was a boy, my dear mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books, because she did not believe in fairies.",

  "Then the man persuaded her, and talked so much to her about the wealth that they would have, and what a good thing it would be for herself, that at last she made up her mind to go, and washed and mended all her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and held herself in readiness to set out.",
  "They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape.",
  "He went up to the tower in front of you.",
  "You'll take the usual Sword of Sharpness, said his Majesty.",
  "Up there sprang a tall, white flame of fire, waving like a tongue of light; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful, strong, funny, black cat that ever was seen!",
  "said the mother; and this minute.",
  "But I soon set them at ease, for, cutting the strings he was bound with, I put him gently on the ground, and away he ran.",
  "I have a step-mother who has bewitched me so that I am a white bear by day and a man by night; but now all is at an end between you and me, and I must leave you, and go to her.",
  "His wish was granted, and there was an end to feasting and rejoicing.",
  "The boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her.",
  "They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar.",
  "Very well, said the king; Prince Prigio, you have your choice.",
  "When day had quite come, the girl seated herself under the castle windows, to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and the Princess with the long nose wanted to have that also.",
  "she cried, in the language of her own country, which came back to her on a sudden.",
  "and a prince is polite, when he is in love!",
  "The Emperor concluded that I was drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching in a hostile manner.",
  "Why can't you give a civil answer to a civil question?",
  "On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels, she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead.",
  "No man ever saw her, and she never saw even the fields and the sea, but only the sky and the sun, for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house of brass.",
  "And pray what does mine lack?",
  "With this he was aiming at a little white ball; and suddenly he swung up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air, over several trees.",
  "He was ready to do this himself.",
  "The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning.",
  "The fagot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher 's.",
  "The King recognized her at once -- indeed, he had already thought several times how much like his poor little Miranda she was.",
  "No, answered the youth; but someone stood on the stairs up there just opposite the trap-door in the belfry, and because he would n't answer me, or go away, I took him for a rogue and knocked him down.",
  "THE WONDERFUL SHEEP Once upon a time -- in the days when the fairies lived -- there was a king who had three daughters, who were all young, and clever, and beautiful; but the youngest of the three, who was called Miranda, was the prettiest and the most beloved.",
  "They were just setting out again, but now the horses were not able to draw the coach.",
  "Was that against your will?",
  "A million of money may not seem much, but a pair of young people who really love each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in his pocket.",
  "Glory to Pachacamac, even though we die to-day!",
  "I can not tell you the delight of all Manoa, and of the Inca, when they saw the Flying Horse returning, and recognised their long-lost princess, who rushed into the arms of her father.",
  "Nobody could undo the clasps, however strong or clever he might be; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign, and the book flew open at the right place -- Book IV., chapter vi., about the middle of page 576.",
  "No, he replied, it's quite hopeless; if someone could only tell me how to!",
  "This poem comforted Enrico more or less, and he showed it to Prigio.",
  "Just as they were still looking for him, however, came a knight riding on a steed that was much, much finer than that which the knight in copper armor had ridden, and this knight had silver armor and a silver saddle and bridle, and all were so bright that they shone and glistened when he was a long way off.",
  "So he pulled out his steel for striking fire, and threw it over the horse, and it stood as still as if it had been nailed to the field, and the boy could do just what he liked with it.",
  "While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them.",
  "There the brass-bound chest lay, with the Princess and her baby in it, till a man of that country came past, and saw it, and dragged it on to the beach, and when he had broken it open, behold!",
  "In a moment the crowd, which had been staring at him, rushed away in every direction, with cries of terror, declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure!",
  "He struck a light with a flint and steel, lit a torch, and ran upstairs to the garret.",
  "He then ordered Mr. Whittington in, who was at this time cleaning the kitchen and would have excused himself from going into the counting-house, saying the room was swept and his shoes were dirty and full of hob-nails.",
  "I 'm practising walking without stockings, too, to harden my feet, he said, in a more familiar tone of voice.",
  "The prince just took time to shout, The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit!",
  "Sir, replied Prince Ahmed, I have no share in the compliment your Majesty is pleased to make me; all the honor is due to the Fairy my spouse, whose good advice I followed.",
  "Thus he rode for a long way -- it may have been a third part of the way up -- but when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again.",
  "One of these, said he, belongs to the poor, one to the King, and the third is yours.",
  "If I had n't been carried, replied the cabbage, you may be very sure that I should n't have thought of going there.",
  "Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother.",
  "In Pantouflia, it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing.",
  "Still, he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards, backwards, into the cleft below the hill; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered.",
  "EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON Once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who had many children and little to give them in the way either of food or clothing.",
  "They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him, and then staggered back in the greatest surprise, looking in every direction for the person they had jostled.",
  "Gently, gently, don't boast too much, I 'm as strong as you, and stronger too.",
  "He never could have got it on the saddle of the Flying Horse if the dark lady had not touched it with her ebony wand, and made it light to carry till it was wanted for his purpose.",
  "When I came back I settled in London, and, having taken part of a small house, I married Miss Mary Burton, daughter of Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier.",
  "Her majesty had been travelling by post all the time, and, luckily, had heard of none of the doings since Prigio, Benson, and the king left Gluckstein.",
  "He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him in the hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the Princess at his side.",
  "But perhaps the thing has been overdone; at all events, it is not a success.",
  "He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: What are you standing there for?",
  "The other princes and knights were not able even to call to tell him how useless it was to try to ascend the hill, so amazed were they at sight of his magnificence.",
  "All was well with her too, she said; and she had everything that she could want.",
  "But the prince was not clever for nothing.",
  "Do you know where the bronze ring is which the genii obey?",
  "So he took Charming back to the palace with him, and after seeing that he had a very good supper he said to him: You know that I love Pretty Goldilocks as much as ever, her refusal has not made any difference to me; but I don't know how to make her change her mind; I really should like to send you, to see if you can persuade her to marry me.",
  "But presently he took courage and delivered his harangue, bravely ending by begging the Princess to spare him the disappointment of going back without her.",
  "Go away, he said; I don't want to see anybody.",
  "When she wished to get on her horse Falada again, the waiting-maid called out: I mean to ride Falada: you must mount my beast; and this too she had to submit to.",
  "He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard.",
  "I must look at them again some day.",
  "But Charming only gave him two little pats and said nothing, and very soon he fell asleep.",
  "But when the Captain of the Guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black, so that would not have deceived the King either.",
  "for Dick was kneeling and weeping bitterly at the royal feet.",
  "At first nobody would hear of this arrangement, and her father and brothers, who loved her dearly, declared that nothing should make them let her go; but Beauty was firm.",
  "No, madam, answered Felicia; my brother ate all the supper there was.",
  "The Fairy of the Desert had by her enchantments raised such a terrible storm that the boldest pilot would not venture out in it, so she was not afraid of her prisoner's being able to escape; and he found it some relief to think sadly over his terrible situation without being interrupted by his cruel captor.",
  "Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life.",
  "By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds, and, had the Prince only known what they were saying, or the maiden been listening, they might have been spared much sorrow, but they were thinking only of each other, and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens.",
  "Out of gratitude for your favors I procured information of the whole proceedings, venturing my head for your service, and this was the charge against you: First, that you, having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port, were commanded by his Majesty to seize all the other ships, and put to death all the Bigendian exiles, and also all the people of the empire who would not immediately consent to break their eggs at the smaller end.",
  "And, as he spoke, the Queen saw the lions, which were running down a hill toward them.",
  "Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake.",
  "The slave went back to her mistress.",
  "Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own hand.",
  "At last she became anxious, and woke the youth, and asked: Don't you know where my husband is?",
  "But the prince only laughed, and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good; for violets do not roast, or boil, or broil, or bake.",
  "How should they have learned to cultivate your garden?",
  "the Queen also touched her and cried Putty, putty!",
  "He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which, for my part, I believe it does.",
  "The next day the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou, to whom he told his father's new demand, which, he said, he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first; for, added he, I can not imagine there can be such a man in the world; without doubt, he has a mind to try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it, or he has a design on my ruin.",
  "It is only just that you should send them something very precious as a remembrance of yourself.",
  "Frightful as this encounter was the King's courage was unshaken, and by the aid of his wonderful sword he cut them in pieces one after the other.",
  "What does your Majesty mean?",
  "Indeed, said the Prince, when I have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it; but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I have had nothing to eat to-day.",
  "I find you don't know the power a husband has over a wife; and yours would show that her love to you was very indifferent if she, with the power she has of a fairy, should refuse you so trifling a request as this I desire you to ask of her for my sake.",
  "Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for.",
  "For, though some kings have put their eldest sons to death, and most have wished to do so, they have never been better loved by the people for their Roman virtue.",
  "The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste, not knowing what made Prince Ahmed return so soon, who, not giving her time to ask him the reason, said: Princess, I desire you would have compassion on this good woman, pointing to the magician, who was held up by two of his retinue.",
  "where are now my children, my poor children?",
  "Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.",
  "If thou hadst been at the ball, said one of her sisters, thou wouldst not have been tired with it.",
  "At this discourse of the crier the Prince of the Indies, considering that the principal motive of his travel was to carry the Sultan, his father, home some singular rarity, thought that he could not meet with any which could give him more satisfaction.",
  "It is a royal road to glory, or giant-slaying made easy.",
  "When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness.",
  "Where have you been hiding?",
  "Besides, I know it is wrong to listen to what one is not meant to hear.",
  "He approached with trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon his knees.",
  "He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on.",
  "He carries it about with him, said the Princess.",
  "But you are young, of course, and can not be expected to think of everything.",
  "Unloading the ass, he said to her: This is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed.",
  "He therefore called his workmen together, and bade them dig a deep round hole in the earth, and then he had a prison of brass built in the hole, and then, when it was finished, he locked up his daughter.",
  "It is time that I should fulfil my promise, and begin your punishment.",
  "said he; I see then how thou wouldst cheat me, thou cursed woman; I know not why I do not eat thee up too, but it is well for thee that thou art a tough old carrion.",
  "You see it is so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by a simple princess.",
  "He may be going on still; and, with your leave, I'll go and try a sword-thrust with him.",
  "Just tell me when you have got hold of the shovel, said the Master-maid.",
  "He came down, and, when upon the ground, he could see it no more, which grieved him sadly.",
  "-- Dick bisects the Giant.",
  "and the door opened and shut behind him.",
  "Then a gust of wind came and blew Curdken's hat away, so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it, and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair: all this the old King observed, and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him.",
  "What they said was very true; for a few days after the King's son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit.",
  "And now, if Herr Schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery, where refreshments are ready, I shall have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours.",
  "Off he flew; and there he was in a second, just beside poor Alphono's garden-engine.",
  "He then applied to his mistress, and to his good friend Miss Alice, who refused to take any part of the money, but told him she heartily rejoiced at his good success, and wished him all imaginable felicity.",
  "But when she went up to the Prince's room he was again asleep, and, let her call him, or shake him, or weep as she would, he still slept on, and she could not put any life in him.",
  "'\n` Madam Ragotte, ' said I, ` when one is at the bottom of a pit where one has fully expected to be roasted alive, it is impossible to think of asking such a charming person as you are to marry one!",
  "I wish she were a daughter-in-law; I wish Dick would take a fancy to marry her, said the king.",
  "You may imagine how miserable she was, and how she cried as she went on, not knowing which path to follow, and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces.",
  "She thought that if she carried him off to some frightful cavern and chained him to a rock, then the fear of death would make him forget Bellissima and become her slave.",
  "Because I love the gardener's son, answered the Princess.",
  "Will you give me your youngest daughter?",
  "said the prince, you are forgiving -- For you are brave!",
  "The king, said he to himself, has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me, or helps me in any way.",
  "Yes, and so did we two fight to get out that time when we were in the mountain, said the Master-maid.",
  "Will you go back to your hole and swear, on your honour as a Firedrake, to listen quietly?",
  "Oh, ` Gio, how you frighten me!",
  "If you had accepted my offer, said Tintin, you would only have had me to regret, and I should have had all your gratitude.",
  "Beyond it they marked the glittering spires and towers of Manoa, the City of the Sun; and Thither, said King Prigio, who had been explaining how matters stood, to Ricardo, we must ride, for I believe they stand in great need of our assistance.",
  "But, if I do come back alive -- why, I can not be more the true heir than I am at present; now can I?",
  "But wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long, he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome.",
  "We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699; and our voyage at first was very prosperous.",
  "All the company laughed at the adventure but Miss Alice, who pitied the poor boy, and gave him something to buy another cat.",
  "Yes, he has, spake the third, for she's sitting beside him on the ship.",
  "So you see that cleverness, and minding your book, have some advantages, after all.",
  "However, the Firedrake's dead and done for; so never mind him.",
  "His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one, with the proper officers to exercise them.",
  "When they had tired out their horses, so that they could do no more, they again had to stop altogether.",
  "But for Jaqueline, Ricardo's conduct would have been blazed abroad, England would have been irritated.",
  "Then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old woman was, and how she feared some great disaster.",
  "The Emperor, advancing toward me from among his courtiers, all most magnificently clad, surveyed me with great admiration, but kept beyond the length of my chain.",
  "When he had slept again for many hours, he began to move and stretch himself.",
  "The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in everything she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection.",
  "And what are we to say to your mother?",
  "So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he could do to win the Princess's love.",
  "Then she spoke: Wind, wind, gently sway, Blow Curdken's hat away; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold, Now astray and hanging down, Be combed and plaited in a crown.",
  "Well, what do you think of that little piece of business, friend?",
  "Indeed, I hope so, my sweet shepherdess, cried the Prince, who was at that moment restored to his natural shape.",
  "There is a little white moon shining in each of them!",
  "You are my most trusty John: you must stand by me.",
  "Rather a neat thing; drew it up myself, added his majesty.",
  "The woman, seeing them so very pretty, began to weep, and said to them: Alas!",
  "And now I'll show you fun!",
  "said she who sat upon the bench.",
  "It may be useful when one is obliged to defend oneself, but surely a prince ought not to give his whole time to nothing else!",
  "She was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man.",
  "You have taken it yourself, sister, said the first gray woman.",
  "When they went away, the rest of the company slipped off quietly, and the king was left alone with the ambassador; for the queen could hardly be said to count.",
  "So Felicia came forward and saluted the Queen timidly, but with so much grace that all were surprised.",
  "A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.",
  "So all went well and happily for a time, but then she began to be very sad and sorrowful, for all day long she had to go about alone; and she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and sisters.",
  "There lies the mill at the bottom of the sea, and still, day by day, it grinds on; and that is why the sea is salt.",
  "Ricardo then, after a few words of courtesy on both parts, picked up his useless carpet, took his farewell of the royal party, and, with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar, returned at full speed, but with a heavy heart, to Pantouflia, where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon.",
  "After giving this order he went to his own room, but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake, and the Fairy Truth appeared suddenly before him.",
  "But the prince said he had his plan, and he stayed that night at the ambassador 's.",
  "He was taller by about the breadth of my nail than any of his Court, which alone was enough to strike awe into the beholders, and graceful and majestic.",
  "His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request.",
  "I daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after all.",
  "With all my cap of darkness, and my shoes of swiftness, and my sword of sharpness, I never could get near that beast, he said; and if I did stalk him, I could not hurt him.",
  "The ladies heard him in silence, and then they said: Follow us, and they flew lightly beside the Flying Horse till they had crossed all the bright side of the moon, above the silver palaces and silver seas, and reached the summit of the Mountains of the Moon which separate the bright from the dark side.",
  "Diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles, and the gold and silver, the beautiful dresses, the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him; he thought to himself: If the Princess consents to leave all this, and come with me to marry the King, he may think himself lucky!",
  "Ever so many -- four, five, six, seven -- little shining drops of silver lying on the carpet, as if they had melted and fallen there!",
  "But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind.",
  "The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely.",
  "It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able to deceive her.",
  "After they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again.",
  "Prince Ali was overjoyed at his bargain, and persuaded himself that, as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so rare and admirable, the Princess Nouronnihar would be the recompense of his fatigue and trouble; that he thought of nothing but visiting the Court of Persia incognito, and seeing whatever was curious in Schiraz and thereabouts, till the caravan with which he came returned back to the Indies.",
  "Another made him beautiful for ever; and another, brave; and another, lucky: but the last fairy of all, a cross old thing, crept up and said, My child, you shall be too clever!",
  "But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind.",
  "Indeed, your majesty, said Prigio, you must permit me to correct your policy.",
  "No, she said, I have not done anything at all.",
  "The prince ran up to the turret, fetched the magic spy-glass, and looked up London, Rome, and Hanover, as you would in a map.",
  "After luncheon, the king asked Jaqueline to come into his study, as he often did, to help him with his letters.",
  "there is the tree where seven people have been hanged, and are now learning to fly; sit down under it and wait till nightfall, and then you'll pretty soon learn to shudder.",
  "When her father perceived they had this good liking for each other he proposed a match between them, to which both parties cheerfully consented, and the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Sheriffs, the Company of Stationers, the Royal Academy of Arts, and a number of eminent merchants attended the ceremony, and were elegantly treated at an entertainment made for that purpose.",
  "And the Earthquaker's got her, and the Giant's got the other things, Dick ended, crying bitterly.",
  "Then, Keep your dross, he shouted, meaning the million; but let me keep my promise.",
  "And do I not see St. Nicholas at the helm?",
  "He would go down into the kitchen, and show the cook how to make soup.",
  "I wish I were in ` The Bear, ' at Gluck-stein, said he to himself; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there.",
  "In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters, and the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the Prince: Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me.",
  "The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner, without ever lifting up her head, and answered in broken words and sighs, as if she could hardly fetch her breath, that she was going to the capital city, but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her, and she was forced to lie down where he saw her, far from any habitation, and without any hopes of assistance.",
  "And when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.",
  "And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them.",
  "Nobody had ever seen such a battle; he had it all to himself, and he never enjoyed anything more.",
  "The first thing she did when she reached her room was to throw the cabbage out of the window.",
  "I will just try what this is like too, said the Prince, thrusting another lock of his hair into it, and it came out silvered over.",
  "He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual, that he quite forgot to take off his cap.",
  "We'll leave you, and hope to find you perfectly cured when we come again an hour hence.",
  "Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone's else, did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received.",
  "But the prince was so busy in talking to his lady, and in eating his dinner too, that he never observed anything unusual.",
  "None of these things could terrify the noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf himself; but even his courage gave way when he saw what was happening to his beloved Princess.",
  "And how will you set about that?",
  "Short as Miranda's absence had been, it had seemed like a hundred years to the King of the Sheep.",
  "I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me.",
  "Now they can't, because they are afraid of you; for you are so awfully clever.",
  "Get the head stuffed, will you?",
  "Then there rose a steam so dreadful, such a white yet fiery vapour of heat, that no one who had not the prince's magic glass could have seen what happened.",
  "Presently, I shall wake up in my own bed at Falkenstein.",
  "Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim.",
  "The wretches shall pay for it, and that instantly.",
  "He led her into a magnificent hall, where all the Court was assembled, and himself taking up the golden bowl full of water, he offered it to her that she might dip her pretty fingers into it.",
  "All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the prince had found them in the dark garret.",
  "It would be a miracle, she said to herself, and miracles do not happen; therefore this has not happened.",
  "Why, by winning these ten thousand purses.",
  "where are now our poor children?",
  "Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber, where, leaving her to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a young hind, which the Queen had for her supper, and devoured it with the same appetite as if it had been the young Queen.",
  "The old crone did not like this either.",
  "There he was, swimming and diving for pleasure, tossing up the flaming waves, and blowing fountains of fire out of his nostrils, like a whale spouting!",
  "The magician, at her arrival, saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed's journey, which she had heard of before she came, and therefore was prepared with an infallible means, as she pretended.",
  "He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of wax.",
  "But the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars, and that he was obliged to do.",
  "Here is the first: TO ALL LOYAL SUBJECTS.",
  "Presently, after walking wildly up and down, he wrote these verses upon the sand with his stick: At last may I upon this shore Lighten my sorrow with soft tears.",
  "At least, continued she, let us die together.",
  "But while all this was done I still lay in a deep sleep, and I did not wake till four hours after we began our journey.",
  "Of course I could not let her tell me that, poor child!",
  "Grind salt, and grind both quickly and well, said the skipper.",
  "The sisters pretended not to know, but the old woman easily guessed what had happened, and, as she was in reality a wicked witch, determined to punish the fugitives.",
  "Now, there is only one book which tells how that can be done, and there is only one reason for doing it; namely, to find out what is some other person's secret.",
  "Those fellows up there never opened their mouths, and were so stupid that they let those few old tatters they have on their bodies burn.",
  "And saying these words, without more ado, he cut the throats of all his seven daughters.",
  "Then his Majesty observed that, from all he had ever read or heard, he believed Ethiopia, where the fight was, to be in Africa, not in Asia.",
  "The boy is beginning to show some sense, said the king to himself, knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition.",
  "It lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and never would you find your way there.",
  "She thought of lecturing him a little about disobeying his father, but it did not seem a good opportunity.",
  "Then he was led upstairs; and he made his bow to the pretty lady, who, of course, made him a magnificent courtesy.",
  "We beg you not to insist upon going on.",
  "When he left off he counted the slain, and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs.",
  "Not a house was to be seen; the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great tree, and there he crouched all the night which seemed to him the longest he had ever known.",
  "answered the king, very angrily; and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of the queen.",
  "She took out her chest of gold, and flung a handful of it or so into the fire, and the gold boiled up and poured out over the whole of the hut, until every part of it both inside and out was gilded.",
  "So everything went on for a long time, until at last, happy as she was, Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters; and one night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her what was the matter.",
  "I can do better than that, cried the youth, and went to the other anvil.",
  "But the old King had no work for her, and could n't think of anything; so he said, I 've a small boy who looks after the geese, she 'd better help him.",
  "This means succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim's house, the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk.",
  "Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble.",
  "The father was quite pleased with the proposal, because he thought: It will be a good discipline for the youth.",
  "The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride.",
  "The poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed, and but for a little stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst.",
  "The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient at the Fairy's continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away.",
  "My dear child, said he, you are of an age to take a husband, therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the son of my prime minister.",
  "This he put into his pocket, being determined to lay it out to the best advantage; and the next day, seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm, he ran up to know the price of it.",
  "This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.",
  "I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the ends into a hook.",
  "said the King; this animal shall carry me to my palace, and was about to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead.",
  "How perilous are voyages at sea, how uncertain the winds and the waves, and how many accidents attend a naval life!",
  "By great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard's son in the palace garden, who understood the speech of birds, and to him he had entrusted the message.",
  "The children must be got rid of; we'll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they wo n't be able to find their way out again.",
  "Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover anything; and having turned his head about on every side, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way from the forest.",
  "His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan's presence.",
  "But the Remora, hissing terribly, and visibly melting away in places, yet held his ground; and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake -- up and up, till they reached his knees, and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain.",
  "So they resolved to go in a body to the King, and all to send in their papers.",
  "He seems to believe in his own nonsense.",
  "In this situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant, where the cook saw him, and, being an ill-natured hussy, ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him.",
  "Here the prince offered to Ricardo the ruby-studded hilt of his rapier, which had a beautiful white shark-skin sheath.",
  "King Prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions, on business of importance, and the young people were sitting in the royal study.",
  "That's hearty, said the Giant; I like a fellow of your kind.",
  "This strange old woman, without saying a single word, hobbled three times round the gallery, followed by the basilisks, then stopping in the middle, and brandishing her crutch threateningly, she cried: Ho, ho, Queen!",
  "The man found no difficulty in making the royal garden produce flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year the park was not like the same place, and the King showered gifts upon his new servant.",
  "Then she remembered all he had done for her, and without saying a word to anyone went straight to the tower, and with her own hands took off Charming's chains.",
  "He hunted the castle through in vain, and then went out to the stable-yard; but all the dogs, of course, had been taken away, and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry.",
  "The young Queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the hundred years she had been asleep; and how to find in the yard a beast so firm was what puzzled him.",
  "Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear.",
  "asked the king of the family executioner, a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet, who was only employed in the case of members of the blood royal.",
  "I beg your pardon, Jack dear.",
  "To be sure he saw plenty of poor people in distress, and, being a good-hearted, though careless, lad, Dick would occasionally fly off with the Purse of Fortunatus in his pocket, and give them as much money as they needed -- it cost him nothing.",
  "One shall have lost a leg, another an arm, the third shall be a hunchback, another lame or club-footed or blind, and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars.",
  "And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver.",
  "You see, said the Fairy, that the pavilion is larger than what your father may have occasion for; for you must know that it has one property -- that it is larger or smaller according to the army it is to cover.",
  "'\nOn this her majesty grew more indignant, if possible.",
  "Then the six men came and carried him out again.",
  "She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again.",
  "The Fairy Paribanou, I am sure, taught you nothing beyond the ordinary magical accomplishments suited to your rank; but there are a great many things in the Cornelius which I think you should not study till you are older and wiser.",
  "I would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at last the boys and girls ventured to come and play at hide-and-seek in my hair.",
  "and he wished he had brought the Sword of Sharpness, for you can not prod down a tree with the point of a rapier.",
  "He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife's face, and, having brought her to herself, said: Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues, that I may go and catch them.",
  "She shall be a mourning bride, cried the king savagely, unless -- here he paused for a moment -- unless you bring me back Alphohso and Enrico, safe and well!",
  "Then he ran upstairs, for the last time, to the fairy garret, and he put on the wishing cap.",
  "The giant laid the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches; and the giant, who could n't see what was going on behind him, had to carry the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain.",
  "For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself, I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these, with all the look of age.",
  "The old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence.",
  "In the daytime she sat down once more beneath the windows of the castle, and began to card with her golden carding-comb; and then all happened as it had happened before.",
  "They went and told the King about him, and said what a weighty and useful man he 'd be in time of war, and that it would be well to secure him at any price.",
  "The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; but, alas!",
  "madam, said Felicia, a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose does not fear robbers.",
  "The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment, and then back to white again, they were so alarmed at the change.",
  "There are difficulties about that.",
  "Away he went after the Prince and the Master-maid so fast that the wind whistled behind him, and it was not long before he came to the water, but he could not get over it.",
  "But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path.",
