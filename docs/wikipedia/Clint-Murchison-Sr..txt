Clinton Williams "Clint" Murchison Sr. (April 11, 1895 &ndash; June 20, 1969) was a noted Texas-based oil magnate and political operative. Among his companies was the Southern Union Company. He was also the father of Dallas Cowboys owner Clint Murchison Jr..

Murchison, the third child of John Weldon and Clara Lee Murchison, was born April 11, 1895 in Tyler, Texas.

During World War I, Murchison served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army. He later joined Sid W. Richardson as lease traders in the Burkburnett oilfield in 1919.

Murchison owned several ranches, one in northeastern Mexico, where he hosted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1950.

In 1920, Murchison married Anne Morris from Tyler, Texas and they had three sons: John Dabney Murchison (September 5, 1921 &ndash; June 14, 1979), Clinton Williams Murchison, Jr. (September 12, 1923 &ndash; March 30, 1987), and Burk Murchison (January 26, 1925 &ndash; April 15, 1936). His 1st wife, Anne Morris Murchison, died in 1926. Murchison married again in 1943 to Virginia Long from Commerce, Texas.

Murchison was reported to have been ill several years prior to his death. On July 20, 1969, he died at Henderson County Memorial Hospital in Athens, Texas. At the time of his death, Murchison's fortune was estimated to be $500,000,000.

Madeleine Duncan Brown, an advertising executive who previously claimed to have had an extended love affair and a son with President Lyndon B. Johnson, said that she was present at a party in Murchison's Dallas home on the evening prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy that was attended by Johnson as well as other famous, wealthy, and powerful individuals including J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon, and H. L. Hunt. According to Brown, Johnson had a meeting with several of the men after which he told her: “After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That’s no threat. That’s a promise.” Brown's story received national attention and became part of at least a dozen John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.
