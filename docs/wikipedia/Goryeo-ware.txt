Goryeo ware (고려도자기 ; Goryeo dojagi) refers to all types of Korean pottery and porcelains produced during the Goryeo dynasty. Goryeo most often however refers to celadon (greenware).

The Gangjin Kiln Sites produced a large number of wares.

An artist of the post-war era who specialised in it was Living National Treasure Yu Geun-Hyeong. His work was documented in the short film Koryo Celadon in 1979.

Many celadon pieces from Goryeo are listed as National Treasures of South Korea.
