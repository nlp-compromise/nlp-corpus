University of Nevada, Reno Arboretum is a state arboretum located across the campus at the University of Nevada, Reno in Reno, Nevada.

The arboretum was established in 1985 and contains a collection of trees, shrubs, flowers, ornamentals and native flora, including over 60 genera and about 200 species of trees, many with several cultivars present. Thirty-six mature elm trees line the Quad.


 * Cherry Blossom Garden – Mt. Fuji cherry trees, azaleas, bamboo and ornamental grasses.
 * Benson Gardens and Xeriscape, with Challenger Tree Memorial – crabapples, plums, maples, evergreens, plus an area of drought tolerant plants. Blue Atlas Cedars commemorate the astronauts lost in the Challenger Space Shuttle accident.
 * The Quad – The Quad was originally used as a parade ground for student cadets in the late 19th century and in 1908 replanted to Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia lawn. In 1988, several elms were removed due to Dutch elm disease. The Quad is now planted with a mixture of elm, hackberry, ash and oak trees, and the lawn is interspersed with weeping white birch, oak and evergreen trees.
