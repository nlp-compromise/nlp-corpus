Jerry Wayne Mumphrey (born September 9, 1952) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder who played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1974–79), San Diego Padres (1980), New York Yankees (1981–83), Houston Astros (1983–85) and Chicago Cubs (1986–88). Mumphrey finished 20th in voting for the 1981 American League MVP and was the Astros All-Star Game representative in 1984.

Along with San Diego Padres' teammates Gene Richards and Ozzie Smith, he was part of the first trio from the same team in MLB history to each steal 50 or more bases in a season (1980).

When Mumphrey was traded to the Cubs in December 1985, Cubs General Manager Dallas Green said: "By acquiring Jerry Mumphrey, we got someone who can play three outfield positions and play all three very well."

Mumphrey and his wife, Gloria, live in Tyler, Texas.
