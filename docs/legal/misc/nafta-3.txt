(b) Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), to the extent that a provision of that Part applies to services,
(c) Chapter Twelve (Cross-Border Trade in Services), and

(h) to the measures listed in paragraph 2 of Annex 2103.4.
5. Subject to paragraph 2 and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 3, Article 1106(3), (4) and (5) (Investment - Performance Requirements) shall apply to taxation measures.
