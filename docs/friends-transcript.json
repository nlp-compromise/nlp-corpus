  "In… really long hour world.",
  "I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?",
  "You’re so-so sweet, honey.",
  "I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really need candy.",
  "Because that would be crazy?",
  "Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill?",
  "Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",
  "Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.",
  "And the eye!That was one time, Ross, and they were only like  5 milligrams.",
  "I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt.",
  "Call the other girls and ask.",
  "Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.",
  "You really didn't have to.",
  "So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?",
  "Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",
  "I thought it might be true.",
  "Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",
  "So you know how to fix it?",
  "Phoebe you can’t have both of them!",
  "Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",
  "You’re just—you’re so fit!",
  "I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?",
  "Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.",
  "You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all.",
  "You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",
  "For all he  knows we're just hanging out together.",
  "Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just \"anybody.\"",
  "Chandler, this is not addressed to you.",
  "The important thing to remember – stay cool.",
  "Who knows what could happen?",
  "Is Rachel having the baby?",
  "It's not... quite what I'm saying.",
  "Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle.",
  "Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",
  "I thought you might want to see it.",
  "Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.",
  "So what's the big news you had us rush all the  way over here for?",
  "I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.",
  "There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.",
  "It’s-it’s-it’s almost dead!",
  "He’s not angry at the room either.",
  "God, would you just calm down!",
  "Hey, you made it into a bunny.",
  "You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!",
  "You could make a ton of money.",
  "Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",
  "Why isn't she staying with you guys?",
  "Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.",
  "You are way to young to have seen that!",
  "Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?",
  "I left my wallet here on purpose.",
  "Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus.",
  "Oh, okay, you’re not a pushover.",
  "Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you�re right.",
  "She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.",
  "But the audition went really good.",
  "So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?",
  "Oh, how about the PointerSisters �I am so excited�.",
  "Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver.",
  "Where the hell have you been?!",
  "You should know that, Rachel, you're  a mother.",
  "You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.",
  "Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?",
  "Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league!",
  "Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat.",
  "It really made me think about that other thing.",
  "Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow!",
  "Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden  my hair got tangled in the chain.",
  "people so why you all dressed  up.",
  "As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.",
  "Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel.",
  "Why would you even want to come Ross?",
  "I would get a room with this cake.",
  "I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple.",
  "Didn't you listen to the story?",
  "Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.",
  "Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?",
  "Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.",
  "People will always wanna invest in movies!",
  "Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind.",
  "Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge?",
  "Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!",
  "So this is where you work?",
  "Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.",
  "Well, where’s the logic in that?!",
  "Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play.",
  "And do you know what girls are really good at?",
  "Phoebe, what's the matter?",
  "I don't care, I don't care!",
  "No, I'm... not going to Minsk.",
  "Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",
  "It’s still——It’s got a tail!",
  "Yeah, you're right about that.",
  "You got that from what I said?!",
  "I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.",
  "You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",
  "Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.",
  "So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…",
  "Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",
  "and I just... gave him your  address I... I... I didn't even think about it.",
  "Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.",
  "I could not have done this without you.",
  "Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.",
  "Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.",
  "I think I could show this cake a good time!",
  "Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude!",
  "That’s me with the janitor Martin.",
  "And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",
  "Guy #2: Well, I’ll see you later.",
  "How's, um.. how's the family?",
  "Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.",
  "I made this game what it is.",
  "This is the girl I told you about.",
  "Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.",
  "Still, he had to find out sometime.",
  "Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before  you know it, we were kissing.",
  "But... but... but we're giving you this!",
  "So you raised her all on your own?",
  "Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?",
  "Phoebe has prepared something as well.",
  "Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey!",
  "Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested.",
  "Um, you know, just out of curiosity...",
  "Hey, where are we going to lunch?",
  "Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard.",
  "They said stuff to me too, y’know!",
  "I couldn't even find it on the map.",
  "Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?",
  "But... it only has to happen once.",
  "Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?",
  "Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",
  "I kinda feel like it's my fault.",
  "Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!",
  "Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.",
  "You scared the crap outta me.",
  "All of your friends are in there and your parents!",
  "Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke - Diet Coke.",
  "So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.",
  "Now that I'm here I might as well help you  with the cleaning and organizing!",
  "Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?",
  "Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",
  "I want to seize every opportunity.",
  "Listen, can you do me a favor?",
  "Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.",
  "Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?",
  "Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!",
  "Wait, wait, he came up with that himself.",
  "Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?",
  "The vet said it’s a simple procedure.",
  "Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.",
  "Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.",
  "You want me to kick his ass?",
  "Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want.",
  "And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.",
  "…so this guy was all It was just so cool!",
  "No I just wanted to make  sure you didn't want to too.",
  "I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.",
  "Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.",
  "That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.",
  "Wow...definitely just Drake...",
  "Ugh, I can not believe this!",
  "So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?",
  "The Cooking Teacher: We’re all beginners here.",
  "We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.",
  "Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.",
  "You’re supposed to wear a costume!",
  "I definitely am gonna see you’re play.",
  "I mean think about it, this is a good thing.",
  "You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?",
  "But right after you tell me who the hell you are.",
  "I could’ve been killed I hope you know!",
  "I think that you need to fight for her!",
  "But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride!",
  "Yeah, because it is slim pickings.",
  "She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.",
  "Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?",
  "Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!",
  "And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.",
  "That's easy, baggage claim.",
  "You just take a big, big swing.",
  "Aren’t these the same flowers?",
  "I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.",
  "But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!",
  "It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",
  "Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.",
  "Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this.",
  "I won’t be needing  a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",
  "I-I see you moved the green ottoman.",
  "That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ And that’s how it’s done.",
  "My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",
  "Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.",
  "I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear.",
  "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",
  "Can I speak to someone in charge please?!",
  "Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",
  "Yeah, well, is that better?",
  "I-I-I don’t know what to say.",
  "Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",
  "Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.",
  "Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?",
  "You're a really good kisser.",
  "Okay, all right, let's do this.",
  "I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!",
  "And might I say your breasts are still showing.",
  "I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances.",
  "I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.",
  "So what does this Bob guy look like?",
  "Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.",
  "I didn't finish my five pages.",
  "Do you know what’s a bad idea?",
  "Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?",
  "I’ll tell you about it later.",
  "I did not go out with your wife!",
  "We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.",
  "She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",
  "I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts.",
  "Joey has the best boyfriend ever!",
  "I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.",
  "Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",
  "Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.",
  "Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",
  "Hey, y'know what you should do?",
  "I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",
  "All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy.",
  "Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!",
  "...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.",
  "Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",
  "Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!\"",
  "Okay, I guess it's just flan for three!",
  "So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",
  "I do have a newfound respect for life.So you wanna get some dinner?",
  "That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, when you’re dead!",
  "So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…",
  "Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",
  "I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!",
  "Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.",
  "But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.",
  "You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",
  "You mean the mom you met in Montauk.",
  "Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.",
  "Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",
  "I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",
  "Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",
  "Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.",
  "Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",
  "These-these are beads of joy.",
  "Well you said you couldn’t go out so....",
  "Just give me a chance too…",
  "I think she means 'You dance",
  "Looking at people differently.",
  "You’ve spoiled everything!",
  "It's just her water breaking.",
  "Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.",
  "Come on tell me your moves.",
  "I'm sure a mature  man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him.",
  "I thought about it and maybe you’re right.",
  "Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",
  "We�re all together right now.",
  "Heads I win, tails you lose.",
  "All right, gimme your foot.",
  "'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?",
  "There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.",
  "Mr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?",
  "She wants me to move to London.",
  "They have a kid together, y'know.",
  "And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!",
  "Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?",
  "I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.",
  "Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised.",
  "I think we're calling off the wedding.",
  "Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself.",
  "Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'",
  "All right, a cow got through!",
  "It's not different at all, is it?",
  "But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right?",
  "Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...  I'm gonna take off...",
  "The guy was hammered, okay?",
  "Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",
  "Yeah, refrigerator college.",
  "Did I just make a huge mistake?",
  "I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.",
  "Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",
  "He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.",
  "No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?",
  "Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",
  "Not take her to the hospital?",
  "It’s really gotta be the smart thing.",
  "Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.",
  "Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.",
  "It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!",
  "Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.",
  "But, uh, I made her dinner.",
  "I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",
  "Thanks so much for showing me around.",
  "Young Ethan: ...in love with you.",
  "Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",
  "Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",
  "I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.",
  "Now, let me explain how this works.",
  "We gotta find a cab and follow them.",
  "I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her.",
  "That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.",
  "You have no idea who I am, do you.",
  "How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!",
  "I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",
  "That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",
  "And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?",
  "Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this.",
  "Look; you got stood up, who cares?",
  "Let me just  check on the baby!",
  "And I know you’ve done it at least twice!",
  "Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.",
  "Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.",
  "All right, it seems pretty simple.",
  "Come on, she'll be here any minute.",
  "I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.",
  "Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",
  "I think I know who you’re talking about.",
  "That noise can only me one thing.",
  "She-she really dug my slides.",
  "You know, and if you get in the.... um...",
  "Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.",
  "Well, what about his family?",
  "Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",
  "I was just being polite, but, alright.",
  "In my spare time I uh, read to the blind.",
  "I’m, I’m breaking up with you.",
  "Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...",
  "Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.",
  "Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?",
  "Why am I talking like this?!",
  "Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one.",
  "It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.",
  "Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!",
  "Kind of uh, kind of a full house here.",
  "I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast.",
  "Well I want to get in on this.",
  "Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",
  "I called the chef who recommended him to me.",
  "This place is really beautiful!",
  "Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!",
  "Please sing at our wedding.",
  "Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.",
  "I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.",
  "Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",
  "Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you.",
  "Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand.",
  "Oh, that was my work laugh.",
  "She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there.",
  "I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",
  "Second of all, I don’t get it.",
  "Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.",
  "Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!",
  "Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.",
  "Aaahh... How much do I owe you?",
  "Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",
  "All right, I have to get that, but no-no.",
  "But umm, that’s really just for me.",
  "But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much!",
  "Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God.",
  "It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember?",
  "And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.",
  "Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?",
  "Aw, you’re right, you’re right.",
  "You mean you didn’t get it from this?",
  "Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.",
  "Could be Rachel asking if someone could  baby-sit again.",
  "The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!",
  "This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",
  "Tell it to the Time Turtle!",
  "I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",
  "Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.",
  "Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.",
  "Y'know what I just realized?",
  "Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.",
  "There he goes, your fianc�e.",
  "Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!",
  "I said I didn’t technically.",
  "Eight o’clock is the cut-off and, aww, it’s 8:02.",
  "I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.",
  "I'm telling you this thing won't print.",
  "So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.",
  "I think she's losing her touch.",
  "Okay, but do you really need another friend?",
  "Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.",
  "And why wouldn't he get it?",
  "You should be the one to go!",
  "OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.",
  "Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?",
  "We are pretty good at this!",
  "She's not made of ice cream!",
  "Alright, who wants to do it?",
  "Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",
  "I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.",
  "More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.",
  "Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?",
  "I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.",
  "Ugh, that was so embarrassing!",
  "It's because I was trying to repel you.",
  "Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.",
  "Joey,   you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",
  "That's what we were gonna name the baby.",
  "But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.",
  "I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.",
  "Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, \"Boy, she-she is a great actress!\" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, \"She is hot!\"",
  "I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from.",
  "The Smoking Woman: Who are you talking too?",
  "Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",
  "Why does this keep happening to me?",
  "He wasn't planning  on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",
  "I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!",
  "I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.",
  "Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.",
  "Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting.",
  "All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.",
  "You don’t know what this means to us!",
  "Because I'm in love with Monica!!",
  "Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!",
  "And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?",
  "Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.",
  "Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side.",
  "My cousin's a paleontologist.",
  "Well, apparently he scares easy.",
  "Yeah, it kinda grows on you.",
  "I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what?",
  "Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.",
  "I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.",
  "Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me?",
  "Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!",
  "Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!",
  "Oh my God, this is horrible!",
  "So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?",
  "I just wish there was something we could do.",
  "Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.",
  "That’s right, I wanna do it with you!",
  "Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor.",
  "So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",
  "Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you.",
  "Joey, you have to talk to her!",
  "Okay, break-up’s still on!",
  "I mean what if this keeps happening?",
  "They're never coming down now.",
  "Are you one of Ben’s mothers?",
  "Okay, stalk me for a while.",
  "Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all!",
  "Pheebs, we had the most incredible night!",
  "Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",
  "I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",
  "Pregnant Woman Slays Four?",
  "Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",
  "Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?!",
  "I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the  regular stuff.",
  ". . maybe we can get  your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.",
  "I know that's not what you want.",
  "I need to tell you something.",
  "Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",
  "This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those!",
  "They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",
  "...And so then I realized.",
  "Who are you going out with?",
  "I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.",
  "And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.",
  "I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway!",
  "Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.",
  "I wrote that one as a joke for you!",
  "Why don't you just marry her?",
  "Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.",
  "I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!",
  "The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?",
  "I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\"",
  "That’s right, still no baby!",
  "I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you.",
  "Is it something I’m putting out there?",
  "Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.",
  ". Please tell me those are clip-ons.",
  "Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?",
  "Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice!",
  "How did she get me to settle down?",
  "Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",
  "Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!",
  "Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps  for me.",
  "Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday.",
  "Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!",
  "He was saying all these really nice things  about me.",
  "Three big fat cartons in two days.",
  "Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but  she did stick with me for ten years.",
  "Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.",
  "Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?",
  "Is that a secret or a lie.",
  "Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,  I think I'm ok.",
  "Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em!",
  "Oh that's an eye removal machine.",
  "Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!",
  "No, no, it�s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.",
  "Well, I’d be forced to file a report.",
  "Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",
  "We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.",
  "I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.",
  "Young lady, don’t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard!",
  "And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.",
  "No way is that the reason!",
  "How do you feel about all this?",
  "No its really okay… Monica!",
  "Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",
  "Umm, I’m just glad you called.",
  "You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.",
  "Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today.",
  "He says that to everybody!",
  "More importantly, was I any good?",
  "Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.",
  "I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.",
  "Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",
  "Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",
  "So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.",
  "Your mother just added him to her list.",
  "Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.",
  "Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say...  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.",
  "Woman On Train: Yes we are.",
  "He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",
  "Do you want to put the book in the freezer?",
  "Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",
  "So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.",
  "Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",
  "Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",
  "The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.",
  "I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",
  "Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'",
  "You’ve made some errors in judgment too!",
  "What have you got to lose?",
  "Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!",
  "No, no... we're not together.",
  "All right, let's start with the handshake.",
  "You’ll be perfect for this!",
  "Pheebs, I don’t know what to say.",
  "Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go.",
  "Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",
  "I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave  your child with another person.",
  "No, I’m picking you up for our date.",
  "Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.",
  "Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—",
  "I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.",
  "Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.",
  "But you know, I'll tell you something.",
  "What the hell are you cooking!",
  "I'm going to get the phone.",
  "When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",
  "I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",
  "Then, you will definitely get him back!",
  "Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",
  "He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.",
  "It's 7:33, I have seven minutes.",
  "This is got to be  killing her.",
  "At the place I told you about last night?",
  "Joey has got a secret peephole!Yes!",
  "And I want her to love me back!",
  "Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose.",
  "I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off.",
  "I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",
  "He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,  plus he'd never suspect it!",
  "Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party  she knows is happening.",
  "No God, definitely not jealous!",
  "He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",
  "There's not much to do around here!",
  "If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?",
  "I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.",
  "Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.",
  "He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know?",
  "They are in for a world of pain!",
  "What do you mean, \"there you are\"?",
  "I gave him an extremely professional massage!",
  "Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.",
  "I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.",
  "And then your ex-wife gets married so fast!",
  "Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?",
  "The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.",
  "Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",
  "Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.",
  "We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.",
  "I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.",
  "You-you must choose Mr. Bing.",
  "Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",
  "Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!",
  "I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.",
  "Actually Monica and I are engaged.",
  "You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.",
  "I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",
  "OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good.",
  "So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.",
  "I have it right here, on ice!",
  "Some people are just into appearances.",
  "I’m sorry, did you say cheese?",
  "Love what you've done with the place.",
  "Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.",
  "Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",
  "What's with all the bottles of liquor?",
  "Actually, I’m here about the assistant job.",
  "Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",
  "That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?",
  "Now that I see them, I win.",
  "I don’t live here anymore.",
  "Though, you’re not supposed to take these.",
  "Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.",
  "Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",
  "It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.",
  "Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!",
  "I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.",
  "But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed.",
  "But the swings are perfectly  safe, and besides Emma loves them.",
  "And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what!",
  "Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the  big screen on the scoreboard.",
  "I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.",
  "Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.",
  "My name in Mike, and I do play piano.",
  "But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right  in fr. . .",
  "Do you wanna get under the covers?",
  "See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",
  "You gotta keep them on their toes.",
  "Oh come——Of course I know that.",
  "I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?!",
  "It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.",
  "Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",
  "Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",
  "We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream.",
  "Ah, which ever is closest.",
  "I’m just saying, get his number just in case.",
  "They're looking for a cook.",
  "Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is.",
  "So those were pity laughs?",
  "What you—don’t hold it like that!",
  "Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations!",
  "Because I am bored...Out of my mind.",
  "See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",
  "With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",
  "Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.",
  "This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...",
  "Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!",
  ".\nUgh, we're screwed, aren't we?",
  "It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, \"USA not ready.\"",
  "Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up.",
  "I love when you talk dirty to me.",
  "You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…",
  "You're afraid I'm a better singer?",
  "I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!",
  "‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.",
  "I know, that’s why I said again!",
  "I know, it was the best I could get out of them.",
  "Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",
  "Wow, Joey and a professor!",
  "How did this happen to me?",
  "We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it.",
  "Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.",
  "Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.",
  "Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal.",
  "I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.",
  "And now you want that money back.",
  "Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.",
  "Judge rules, no violation.",
  "Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",
  "I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.",
  "Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.",
  "Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.",
  "You just freaked out about our relationship.",
  "Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged!",
  "Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven.",
  "Someone musta stolen my credit card.",
  "I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.",
  "Oh, did-did-did I wake you?",
  "Monica, can  I talk to you outside for a minute?",
  "I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know!",
  "He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.",
  "*You* are the head of the household.",
  "Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!",
  "Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",
  "I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.",
  "Then why-why is she going to a play?!",
  "I have the definitive one.",
  "I know, I still need to talk to you.",
  "You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom!",
  "And she wants to destroy it.",
  "See you and I have always been like—",
  "Hey, what are you thinking?",
  "That’s a magnificent wine!",
  "I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them!",
  "Definitely not his mother.",
  "We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.",
  "The woman I love... I love you...  Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my  parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've  ever met in my life...",
  "Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing?",
  "I remember toward the end…",
  "Well, I think the centerpieces are too big",
  "I can't believe what I'm hearing here...",
  "You didn't get the money, did you?",
  "Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.",
  "Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.",
  "And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!",
  "But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.",
  "That uh, hotel you stayed at called.",
  "Oh well umm, I make it myself!",
  "Oh, just a bit of shopping.",
  "You gave my father a lap dance!",
  "Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!",
  "I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!",
  "Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz.",
  "I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.",
  "It's the woman from the hospital admissions office.",
  "Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?",
  "Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?",
  "I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you.",
  "What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name?",
  "Guys, you got your hair cut.",
  "And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",
  "Those are my maternity pants!",
  "We are four short of a bush-o .",
  "Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",
  "…and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!",
  "Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's  cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our  first date.",
  "What-what is your wife’s name?",
  "between his legs and cried out: �Mommy, I�m a girl, take me with you.�",
  "But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen.",
  "She apologized and she apologized!",
  "Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.",
  "Can I see you for a second?",
  "Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.",
  "I’m actually the office manager.",
  "I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other.",
  "Monica's gonna totally freak out!",
  "Woman On Train: We’re at my stop.",
  "I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",
  "Unless maybe they were a park ranger!",
  "No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.",
  "I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",
  "The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part!",
  "Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!",
  "You just carry that around?",
  "Nobody is opening anything ok?",
  "Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open.",
  "Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review.",
  "Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",
  "I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast.",
  "Well, I thought it first, Holmes.",
  "Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!",
  "what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe  you were having an off night",
  "What are you talking about?!",
  "Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",
  "Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",
  "A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?",
  "I could use another reason why women won't look at me.",
  "Oh my God, this is horrible!",
  "Look, Charlie, I just want you to know.",
  "Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",
  "Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",
  "I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.",
  "I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.",
  "Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?",
  "And you, sweetie, I’ll see you tonight.",
  "But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!",
  "Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",
  "She won a thousand dollars!",
  "And in fifth grade I got into a fight.",
  "I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected.",
  "Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…",
  "Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.",
  "Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!",
  "Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?",
  "You're definitely scaring here.",
  "Just get me another doctor!",
  "I know what's going on here.",
  "Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",
  "You know what I’d love to do?",
  "That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.",
  "Joey's Hand Twin: Stop it!",
  "Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!",
  "No-one is manning that wall!",
  "He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.",
  "Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down.",
  "Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.",
  "If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",
  "Try it, I can't feel a thing!",
  "So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",
  "Check out the rack on this chick!",
  "I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",
  "I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!",
  "Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here.",
  "Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!",
  "My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!",
  "Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish.",
  "Are you sure that's what he  was doing?",
  "They couldn't hit a boat if...wait.",
  "Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",
  "I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",
  "Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.",
  "Well, we're not seeing each other, so....",
  "Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear.",
  "Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",
  "Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.",
  "Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.",
  "That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.",
  "My massage client, Arthur?",
  "I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, \"I don't like your massages.\"",
  "Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes.",
  "This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",
  "Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel?",
  "Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",
  "Wow, this place looks great.",
  "Then why did she ask us to…",
  "Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.",
  "May I have the human growing inside you?\"",
  "And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...",
  "Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!",
  "Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no.",
  "Well, I don't think there is anything to do.",
  "And we kinda figured about the porch swing.",
  "Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",
  "Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",
  "I can't wait to be with you!",
  "You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!",
  "'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench.",
  "Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?",
  "Do you want to set the mood a little?",
  "Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?",
  "I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.",
  "I didn’t know you guys actually used those.",
  "He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.",
  "Did that give you some clue?!",
  "Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?",
  "One hundred thousand dollars!",
  "All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya.",
  "Okay, listen this really hurts.",
  "All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",
  "Did they teach you that in your anger management class?",
  "Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.",
  "Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.",
  "So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",
  "I am gonna try and quit drinking.",
  "So-so what did the doctor say?",
  "And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair.",
  "What's wrong with your baby?!",
  "I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him.",
  "You can't stay here just 'cause of me.",
  "Did I use that already today?",
  "Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him!",
  "I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",
  "Hey, how about maroon?Aww, you guys are so cute!",
  "Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.",
  "I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice.",
  "Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...",
  "What the hell is he doing?!",
  "Aaah... you're not good at this...",
  "Well, he’s never coming back!",
  "I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",
  "So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!\"",
  "And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.",
  "And then you lose your apartment!",
  "Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room  and I caught him molesting himself.",
  "There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I  didn’t even be put up for it!",
  "Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",
  "Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!!",
  "Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart",
  "All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",
  "Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry.",
  "I cannot sleep in a public place.",
  "She won’t even open the door!",
  "Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?",
  "Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?",
  "Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",
  "Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",
  "Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",
  "Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window!",
  "Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",
  "Well, he had gravity boots.",
  "Well well, look what you brought.",
  "I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.",
  "No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...",
  "Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",
  "We are so gonna find them this year.",
  "Put the money on the table.",
  "We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!",
  "Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?",
  "But my mom always makes them.",
  "I’m just trying to spice it up!",
  "You know, I just... couple of things I tried ...  I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...",
  "Take it from me, moms love me.",
  "And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",
  "Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?",
  "My friends and family are out there!",
  "Well, like anything can be sexy.",
  "Shhh, busy beaming with pride.",
  "I could ask her to live with me!",

  "Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.",
  "Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?",
  "Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.",
  "Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I�m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she�s doing at home and I�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!",
  "Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.",
  "I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",
  "Oh, you’re welcome a million.",
  "Oh, look at the little cat!",
  "For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.",

  "I mean, that's   just stupid.",
  "Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there’s no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?",
  "I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day.",
  "Is that supposed to be funny!",
  "So uh, who’s your photographer?",
  "Come on Phoebe, look at that!",
  "I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.",
  "Who wants to make some long distance calls?",
  "We’re here to celebrate our love together.",
  "Uhh, actually y’know what, I kinda—I have to take off.",

  "See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories.",
  "They're all brothers and sisters.",
  "Thank you for writing your book.",
  "And I’m guessing  he eats more money than he makes.",
  "I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.",
  "When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!",
  "Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!",
  "I've had it up to here with you two!",

  "That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!",
  "Let's see, she's on the third floor…",
  "This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",
  "How 'bout you make a list about me.",
  "Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.",
  "It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.",
  "Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.",
  "I promise that’s not gonna happen.",
  "Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years.",
  "Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.",
  "'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say \"When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?\"",

  "What he wants to buy your baby?!",
  "I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.",
  "So what if he wants to sleep with her?",
  "Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion.",
  "Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",
  "Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother.",
  "What would you give up, sex or food?",
  "Your ex-boyfriend is insane.",
  "Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?",

  "You’re just so mean to each other!",
  "Which is a big mistake because it is real!",
  "Your secret bachelorette party…",
  "See this circle I’m marking off here?",

  "But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.",
  "Fireman #1: Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.",
  "Hey, you.... So, what's up?",

  "So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?",
  "Mind if we push this pot roast through it?\"",

  "Well, that's gonna be tough Mon.",
  "So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.",

  "But you guys came so close.",
  "It was like a million years ago!",
  "Well where… Where did she go?",
  "I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",
  "Where are your babysitters, huh?",
  "It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.",
  "You know what else I’m not gonna miss?",
  "Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.",
  "I always carry one in my sock.",
  "Remember I got that uh, gala.",
  "That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?",
  "No wait, you don't get to leave!",
  "And a couple of these little tiny boxes.",
  "Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.",
  "So Steve said he had to go to the doctor.",
  "I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.",
  "I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.",
  "But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.",
  "He didn't get the goggles!",
  "Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?",
  "Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.",
  "You’re wasting good pastrami!",
  "Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?",
  "And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!",
  "Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding.",
  "I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do.",
  "We’re-we’re gonna have three kids!",
  "You’re the person who checked out my book?!",
  "I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.",
  "You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!",
  "I mean it’s over… Oh my God!",
  "I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.",
  "Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",
  "Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?",
  "The Flight Attendant: Welcome to Las Vegas.",
  "We're both so proud of how well you're doing.",
  "Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?",
  "I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?",
  "My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.",
  "Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah.",
  "It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.",
  "Pretty much, most of the time.",
  "But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend.",
  "It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",
  "So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",
  "I have no idea, I went to the bathroom.",
  "She is not stealing from us!",
  "I felt a little weird about it.",
  "Well, it doesn’t sound like it!",
  "And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",
  "Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick… And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.",
  "Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.",
  "Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.",
  "Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?",
  "What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?",
  "Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights.",
  "Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",
  "Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!",
  "I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.",
  "So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool.",
  "Wow, your like from a whole other country.",
  "We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!",
  "And where did you find my badge?",
  "So it'll be either you two",
  "So you slept with her for the first time, so what?",
  "But I don’t, hmm... Get me Mark on the phone!",
  "Wh what're what're you doing here?",
  "You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?",
  "Probably just the first half.",
  "Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
  "Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.",
  "We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.",
  "We did have fun, didn't we?",
  "I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this.",
  "No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.",
  "Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",
  "Yeah, they still wear underwear.",
  "Don't think of it as a cigarette.",
  "Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",
  "You and the baby just need better blocking.",
  "This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.",
  "It’s just you and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro.",
  "Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting?",
  "Can you just keep  an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",
  "So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!",
  "In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.",
  "I love her like a, like a friend.",
  "I'm sure they'd help  you.",
  "So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?",
  "Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",
  "Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",
  "I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!",
  "I heard you before, that is so not what this is!",
  "Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!",
  "So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",
  "God Will I’m so glad that you came!",
  "I am learning so much from you.",
  "Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",
  "We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",
  "How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",
  "But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them.",
  "Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",
  "Okay, how long is this going to go on.",
  "This is like the last commercial.",
  "Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?",
  "Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!",
  "But, you believed me, huh?",
  "He kept asking me about chicken.",
  "Why are you defending him?!",
  "So you guys go, have a really good time.So, you had a good day huh?",
  "Oh, I am just awful with children!",
  "Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please.",
  "Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?",
  "You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong!",
  "And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world.",
  "Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",
  "Alright, could I just ask you one question?",
  "Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",
  "You could have him dress up and put on little skits.",
  "I think you should definitely go out with this guy.",
  "You guys'll scooch, won't you?",
  "Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want.",
  "Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...",
  "Taking control of your life.",
  "The days and nights are hard!",
  "Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do.",
  "Okay, what was wrong with that call?",
  "Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",
  "One hand on the sheet Joe!",
  "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard.",
  "I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it.",
  "Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this.",
  "I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",
  "Certainly not a close one.",
  "You're wearing the same shirt.",
  "All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",
  "I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",
  "I don’t think I have the energy for this.",
  "I mean, look, I left a note and everything.",
  "Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.",
  "All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.",
  "Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",
  "Everything doesn't sound fine!",
  "She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.",
  "Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?",
  "Oh wow this is so beautiful.",
  "And I'm going to get us through  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.",
  "Ready to go to the movies?",
  "Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.",
  "Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.",
  "That's what I wanted to hear!",
  "Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",
  "Ross, just forget about it.",
  "And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",
  "Yeah, I don’t think so Joe.",
  "Oh wait, double or nothing.",
  "We can call it out plane-aversary.",
  "Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!",
  "Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.",
  "This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up.",
  "Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?",
  "And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!",
  "I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny.",
  "Yeah, I’m riding the alimony pony.",
  "Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue.",
  "How can you not remember us kissing?!",
  "It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.",
  "That didn't make me uncomfortable at all!",
  "Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.",
  "I really think they’re out of rooms.",
  "Not just health department clean...  Monica clean.",
  "I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken.",
  "Hey, Monica, I got a question.",
  "Because my throat's been hurting?",
  "So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.",
  "I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",
  "Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.",
  "Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?",
  "I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!",
  "Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",
  "Were you just talking to yourself?",
  "Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?",
  "I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",
  "Lee-lo, the laundry's done.",
  "Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.",
  "Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.",
  "Let's just all go in at the same time.",
  "What is so strange about me having a date?",
  "She was more like, \"I see you point, I’m all right with it.\"",
  "Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.",
  "You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject.",
  "Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",
  "I can’t stop thinking about her!",
  "These people'll scooch down.",
  "Why did I have to say Mike?",
  "Where do you want to start?",
  "Okay, first of all, breathe.",
  "I was thinking she was really cool.",
  "Umm, well, what else could it be?",
  "He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!",
  "Claire forgot her glasses!",
  "Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay?",
  "Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!",
  "Hello.� � Okay, \"Bill from the bar.\"�  I'll make sure she gets your number.",
  "I'm really   excited about that chicken.",
  "You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.",
  "You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",
  "Richard’s Date: Oh, that’s real pretty.",
  "Hey man, you want the aisle?",
  "Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.",
  "It'll dry that  rash right up.",
  "No one ever listens to me.",
  "Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday.",
  "Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?",
  "Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool!",
  "You gonna slice them up real nice?",
  "Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.",
  "The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!",
  "I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.",
  "Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them…",
  "Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?",
  "It isn't ridiculous, look around!",
  "Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.",
  "Ross, why don't you come on in.",
  "I can’t believe I never knew that!",
  "Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",
  "Did you see our bank statement?",
  "Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?",
  "Ick, you were eavesdropping.",
  "I really have  to go buddy.",
  "I’m Rachel Greep!\" and he let her right in.",
  "See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.",
  "We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!",
  "And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .",
  "I found my identical hand twin!",
  "Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.",
  "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.",
  "Oh, you know what you should do?",
  "I just, I hate this so much!",
  "Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",
  "The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",
  "Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?",
  "This must have cost him a fortune.",
  "No, it's okay, you didn't know.",
  "The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones.",
  "No-no, not for like another two weeks.",
  "So you still in touch with anyone from high school?",
  "I don't even wanna see Richard again.",
  "Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.",
  "Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.",
  "You went shopping for fur?",
  "Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",
  "Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today.",
  "I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",
  "Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh…",
  "What about you, having those babies for your brother?",
  "Y’know what’s more generous than that?!",
  "Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife!",
  "Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",
  "Well, how could this happen?!",
  "He talks slow but he might pee fast!",
  "Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?",
  "Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.",
  "And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",
  "Uhm... listen I just wanted  to thank you again for having me here tonight.",
  "Well maybe you can cut me some slack.",
  "There's no room under the bed.",
  "I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.",
  "Um, why don't you just follow me?",
  "Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?",
  "Honey, that’s you’re name.",
  "Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",
  "She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",
  "Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair!",
  "-- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?",
  "Well, the club lost it's power.",
  "Rachel, honey.. are you okay?",
  "If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them.",
  "Since when did you start smoking cigars?",
  "Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!",
  "Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring!",
  "It was because you were looking fat pervert!",
  "I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",
  "Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?",
  "He's good with rear things, bring him in too.",
  "Janine is like stretching all over the place.",
  "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",
  "You talk to him, make him scared like you!",
  "Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, \"Spring break!\" All right?",
  "No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.",
  "This has been so great Ray-ray!",
  "So she’s just waiting over there for ya?",
  "Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",
  "So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",
  "Then how come no one here is wearing them?",
  "Can I see you in my office for a minute?",
  "Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink.",
  "Stuff like uh, \"Keep your mitts off my grub?\"",
  "Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?",
  "Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.",
  "I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building  and it  didn't end very well.",
  "I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.",
  "So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.",
  "The Cooking Teacher: Ah Monica, my star student.",
  "I'm gonna make them stay here.",
  "We still have so much to look forward to!",
  "Does that me we-we can’t do it?",
  "Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",
  "Well, of course it smells really bad.",
  "Hello?Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",
  "You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.",
  "But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",
  "And now we're  friends again everything's great!",
  "And the wind sure made it fun.",
  "Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!",
  "The cushions are the essence of the chair!",
  "You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua!",
  "Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.",
  "Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",
  "The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.",
  "All right, everybody open them!",
  "Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you’d want to get back together?",
  "Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",
  "But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",
  "Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.",
  "Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job.",
  "Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona.",
  "I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent.",
  "Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.",
  "Monica's still at the salon, and I'm  just finishing packing.",
  "Have you guys picked a date yet?",
  "Oh we can't, we already have plans.",
  "Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon",
  "It's nothing, it's just- Okay.",
  "Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.",
  "But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen.",
  "Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now.",
  "I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to  open a door and go ohhhh!",
  "Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!",
  "Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.",
  "I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",
  "Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.",
  "Okay, throw it straight this time.",
  "Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.",
  "What did I tell you about the hall?!",
  "Saw a girl with that vest.",
  "I’m gonna get there early, but I’m going to put you on the V.I.P. list, okay?",
  "I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",
  "Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need!",
  "But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.",
  "I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.",
  "I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.",
  "Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",
  "I don’t even know how to use my keycard.",
  "You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.",
  "How can you do this too me?!",
  "Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.",
  "She deserves to know who it's going to.",
  "Yeah, but it was different with him today!",
  "Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",
  "Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people.",
  "You wanna be on my list too?",
  "You don’t think I get up when you get up?",
  "All right Joey, I will help you.",
  "So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",
  "Did someone get her drunk again or?",
  "I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.",
  "Aren't you guys done yet?!",
  "Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it.",
  "Rach, she's not going to remember this.",
  "\"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?",
  "Spanish midgets wrestling.",
  "\"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.",
  "Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?",
  "Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…\"",
  "That’s called a scrum, okay?",
  "I still have your letter!!!",
  "Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!",
  "Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or.... No, Rach!",
  "So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?",
  "Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.",
  "Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry.",
  "I am gonna call him right now!",
  "Frank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!",
  "I can see why, nice shirt!",
  "Let me show you to his table.",
  "Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",
  "How could I be upset over something I never had?",
  "Well you need 60% to pass…",
  "Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff.",
  "I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.",
  "I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.",
  "And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",
  "He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.",
  "Umm, she took it really well.",
  "I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it.",
  "Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",
  "So, um, what do you do for a living?",
  "Nothing for you, you have Paolo.",
  "Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.",
  "It's a Thanksgiving miracle!",
  "That is really nice…lying!",
  "Can I talk to for just a minute?",
  "Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",
  "Hey Rach, remember that whole \"We were on a break thing?\" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",
  "MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!",
  "OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.",
  "I thought there wasn't a ball?",
  "Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up.",
  "My hearing would be impaired.",
  "Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying.",
  "Do you want me to pick you?!",
  "Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.\"",
  "I had fun at the first wedding.",
  "Okay, I�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.",
  "Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",
  "That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",
  "Can you figure out what I’m doing?",
  "How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",
  "Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",
  "Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",
  "Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants.",
  "I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",
  "Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent.",
  "And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?",
  "They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!",
  "Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?",
  "All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast.",
  "I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.",
  "No, from now on, I’m staying in one place.",
  "I mean y'know, I'm thinking.",
  "You kneed me in my misters!",
  "Yeah, I forget which ones.",
  "How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",
  "How, how are you going to face yourself?",
  "I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.",
  "Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.� So you just touch yourself for anything?",
  "Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",
  "That there is no money for my wedding?!",
  "So you're staying in New York!",
  "Honey, well we'll find you something.",
  "She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.",
  "The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",
  "And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.",
  "I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.",
  "That's not gonna make you any money!",
  "Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.",
  "Well then I think that’s it.",
  "Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel!",
  "Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",
  "She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.",
  "Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at.",
  "Oh, interesting you should call me that!",
  "I’m getting more dates than ever!",
  "She speaks four languages.",
  "Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat.",
  "What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?",
  "There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.",
  "Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!",
  "This feels perfectly normal.",
  "Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…",
  "Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right.",
  "Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.",
  "Maybe he wants me to eat meat?",
  "Do you want me to want you to care?",
  "Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table.",
  "Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",
  "I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.",
  "Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter.",
  "Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’",
  "And, thanks for the warning.",
  "Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.",
  "But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.",
  "I mean its amazing Pheebs.",
  "Why don’t we give this another try?",
  "I’ve been waiting up all night for ya.",
  "Come on, you do what you want to do.",
  "See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy.",
  "Well okay, who do we know that’s coming?",
  "Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?",
  "She was the first black man to fly solo across  the Atlantic.",
  "Now this all better be here when I come back.",
  "I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff.",
  "All right, I guess we should go.",
  "Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",
  "Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.",
  "Be a man, just stop calling.",
  "Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",
  "Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.",
  "Umm, slight change of plans.",
  "Of course I remember our kiss.",
  "Yes... What is the end of that sentence?",
  "Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.",
  "Maybe if I wasn't going commando...",
  "Hey, how are you holding up?",
  "Alright call me when you know more.",
  "But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",
  "I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.",
  "Oh yeah, how about you and the, \"I’m sorry!\"",
  "Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",
  "You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?",
  "Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",
  "Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.",
  "You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler.",
  "You're gonna wanna even that out.",
  "Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",
  "Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",
  "Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it.",
  "God we were lame back then.",
  "I'm on a edge  on Chandler.",
  "The doctor let me feel it myself.",
  "Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher.",
  "Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",
  "I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.",
  "...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!",
  "Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.",
  "Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",
  "There's a dad in the commercial?",
  "Yeah, um, may we help you?",
  "I’m telling you, I like the food!",
  "Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",
  "And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.",
  "Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!",
  "All right, I'm out of oven space.",
  "Oh, this could take a while.",
  "Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.",
  "And it was uneven for weeks!",
  "Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore.",
  "‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",
  "You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.",
  "I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....",
  "Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down.",
  "Well did she know you two weren’t married?",
  "Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today.",
  "Oh look who it is, my husband.",
  "You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!",
  "How come I haven’t seen you here before?",
  "Mike, let me ask you something.",
  "So-so you would’ve just lied?",
  "We didn’t think he’d ever propose!",
  "Y’know we already went over this and I won!",
  "What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?",
  "Let's talk about relationships!",
  "I can't decide which route to take to Vegas.",
  "He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.",
  "So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?",
  "It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.",
  "I can breath through my mouth.",
  "I didn't know you were taking a class.",
  ". Can’t believe  it's been a whole year!",
  "That’s always appropriate!",
  "Well, not for a little while.",
  "Oh, I’m just over here with Ben.",
  "Y’know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!",
  "Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.",
  "I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life.",
  "I'm gonna use the cushion.",
  "BARRY: Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore.",
  "I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!",
  "'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.",
  "I’m gonna serve something I make.",
  "If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",
  "Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him.",
  "Well no, just-just that one.",
  "Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",
  "Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",
  "I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.",
  "I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.",
  "So, er... how did it go with Celia?",
  "You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one  of her books!",
  "The Porsche Owner: I live upstate.",
  "Okay, I don't sound like that.",
  "Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!",
  "I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.",
  "Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question.",
  "And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.",
  "All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",
  "Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.",
  "You know that’s… that’s her.",
  "well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my \"In case of emergency\" person?",
  "There's nothing I can do... Ah,  it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.",
  "Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.",
  "That’s what I did to the kids in my building!",
  "Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",
  "Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,  who was the voice of \"Underdog\"?",
  "Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",
  "Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my  black book when I got married!",
  "Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row?",
  "Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",
  "Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room.",
  "ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There.",
  "He keeps shutting me out, y'know?",
  "I think this audition is over.",
  "'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!",
  "Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise.",
  "Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough.",
  "Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there",
  "Don't make this harder than it already is!",
  "Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore!",
  "Just pretend that it didn't happen!",
  "Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?",
  "Oh, you’d like that wouldn’t ya?",
  "Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",
  "Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take  off my bra?",
  "…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!",
  "I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump!",
  "You-you had a big table, but they made you move.",
  "Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux!",
  "Yeah, sure, that’d be great.",
  "She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser.",
  "So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?",
  "Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",
  "Well you look incredible too!",
  "Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.",
  "I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.",
  "I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'?",
  "‘Cause I am really happy about us.",
  "Cause once those cards are dealt...",
  "Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?",
  "Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.",
  "Uh, well I can tell you why.",
  "Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",
  "I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now.",
  "Of course we can still hang out with them.",
  "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at.",
  "Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.",
  "Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.",
  "No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!",
  "Your mother really did the work.",
  "We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...",
  "What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",
  "Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back.",
  "That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.",
  "You are not gonna believe this!",
  "What if the baby needs him?",
  "Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him.",
  "Really focus on his flaws.",
  "Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",
  "I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.",
  "Are you here to take more money?",
  "But you’re still my friend?",
  "It doesn’t hurt that baaad!!!!",
  "I can hear the voices in my head again!",
  "Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",
  "So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",
  "Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea.",
  "I've decided to go to Minsk without you.",
  "Eh, forget about the future and stuff!",
  "Ms. McKenna: Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler, Chandler?",
  "Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",
  "But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",
  "Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?",
  "People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo.",
  "Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",
  "Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much.",
  "Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",
  "We will do anything we can to help you!",
  "I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out.",
  "But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!",
  "You see Amanda and I have a very special...",
  "She said she wants to go away with you?",
  "We went to the Knicks game.",
  "All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",
  "I know how uncomfortable you are.",
  "Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",
  "And given  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",
  "We lost you after you opened up all the presents.",
  "Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.",
  "I mean nothing bad can go down!",
  "If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?",
  "Y’know Bob in Human Resources…",
  "Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.",
  "Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",
  "Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.",
  "So what was Phoebe’s secret?",
  "All right, I'm outta here!",
  "You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!!",
  "'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.",
  "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.",
  "Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?",
  "Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you.",
  "Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.",
  "You just cost me eight dollars a week!",
  "You're the best agent I ever had!",
  "Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to  him!",
  ", but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.",
  "I’m really sorry I was a baby.",
  "They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.",
  "I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",
  "Doesn't know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.",
  "How could I have left them in the copy room?",
  "Y'know since I've been away at college.",
  "Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.",
  "Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it.",
  "How about the closet by the bathroom?",
  "So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?",
  "Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?",
  "And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!",
  "How much easier would it be if it were?",
  "Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?",
  "No, that's just my secretary.",
  "Looks like Joey has a giant hand!",
  "I thought I would, but the translation's no good.",
  "I was just going to do this myself.",
  "I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?",
  "Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.",
  "Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",
  "I mean, how clean can teeth get?",
  "What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?",
  "Okay, but only if you give me a drag.",
  "I believe this is my Mother.",
  "I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",
  "I just…I got so angry just looking at her……face.",
  "Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.",
  "Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever  we go!",
  "Come on, they're gonna love you.",
  "What are you talkin’ about?",
  "And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.",
  "Mostly free weights, but occasionally..",
  "That is an excellent excellent question.",
  "Doctor Connelly: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!",
  "Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...",
  "I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?",
  "I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head.",
  "Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me.",
  "Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear.",
  "how do you know I have one of those?",
  "I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright?",
  "Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",
  "Thought we were trying to find stuff.",
  "You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",
  "Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?",
  "No, I just had to get a picture of this.",
  "I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.",
  "Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.",
  "Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",
  "What the hell took you so long?",
  "We're not having sex anymore!\" It's  gonna be fun!",
  "They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.",
  "That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar.",
  "Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.",
  "I was not and oh God, shh!",
  "Her place was really that bad?",
  "Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down.",
  "Well, I'm telling everyone about you!",
  "Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.",
  "See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",
  "Who cares what the picture looks like?",
  "Make room for your friend!",
  "What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",
  "And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua!",
  "I promise we'll come up with something.",
  "Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",
  "We can just drive up after the party.",
  "Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",
  "Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.",
  "And also, we don’t know what to do with this.",
  "All right, I’ll see you guys later.",
  "No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you.",
  "Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...",
  "We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!",
  "Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",
  "Because it’s Arabian princess day at work!",
  "And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.",
  "Tonight, but don't say anything.",
  "Well of course not, but you were very good.",
  "She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.",
  "My birthday's not for another month!",
  "So in your whole life, you've only been with one——oh.",
  "I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.",
  "I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.",
  "No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing!",
  "So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",
  "I thought we were just gonna  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",
  "I just had the worst anniversary ever.",
  "I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.",
  "So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",
  "Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom.",
  "If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass!",
  "But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",
  "He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",
  "No, it's only been six years.",
  "All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",
  "It was really fun being married to you tonight.",
  "Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl?",
  "I took two psych classes in college.",
  "We totally forgot about lunch!",
  "It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",
  "Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like!",
  "Oh sure, now you�re Mister Sensitivity.",
  "And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.",
  "You wanna what else is the one?",
  "Roughly translated that  means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!",
  "What are you being such a weenie for?",
  "We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.",
  "There was no chemistry between you two!",
  "No, I want everything that you just said.",
  "I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?",
  "Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",
  "You said you didn’t want to go.",
  "Oh umm, my big scene is coming up.",
  "What is so great about that sandwich?",
  "Just a little but...it's just so scary!",
  "Why would a charity give away a free boat?!",
  "How about to the street say from the balcony?",
  "I’ll take it back tomorrow.",
  "What, he's my favourite author!",
  "Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie.",
  "Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",
  "No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",
  "He has a killer apartment.",
  "I wasn't around that much.",
  "We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.",
  "With the blood and the screaming and the little present  that's shooting out of her!?",
  "Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared.",
  "I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.",
  "What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?",
  "But Lilies are the clear choice.",
  "You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",
  "Yeah, what town are we near?",
  "Yeah, well, everybody does!",
  "We’ve come for her things.",
  "Come on boys, come on out!",
  "Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",
  "I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.",
  "I’m divorced, and I have a kid!",
  "Just-just give me my boots.",
  "She keeps squirming, trying to get away!",
  "Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!",
  "You wanna finish this right now?",
  "I'm revelling baby, believe me!",
  "Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.",
  "Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",
  "You’re so strong and together.",
  "We... found them in your old room.",
  "Why-why would you change your mind?",
  "I don't care about any of that!!",
  "I think I hear curtains closing...",
  "Oh my God, I think I’m gonna cry!",
  "This morning I heard him do  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.",
  "We should really learn how to play the real way.",
  "Apparently you can change it to anything you want.",
  "Look listen, that TV movie I went in for?",
  "Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",
  "Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?",
  "Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.",
  "Hey, can this count as her something new?",
  "Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.",
  "Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",
  "Nice to see you again Dr. Green.",
  "So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here?",
  "So, why is Erica coming to visit?",
  "Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",
  "Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay.",
  "But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship!",
  "And look, And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.",
  "I don’t have the worst costume anymore!",
  "Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",
  "Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",
  "Evil Bitch: Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!",
  "How does going to a strip club help him better?",
  "Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up.",
  "Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.",
  "Well, it's official there are no good movies.",
  "She already took out the trash!!!",
  "It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",
  "Who knows what you’re gonna marry!",
  "Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.",
  "Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",
  "Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.",
  "I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.",
  "Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.",
  "And I’m appalled for you by the way.",
  "Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.",
  "Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.",
  "I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",
  "You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay?",
  "Hey, do you guys have......hi.",
  "There is no way I am letting you drive this car!",
  "You didn't hear the speech!",
  "I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",
  "Well, there's two spots left right?",
  "OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.",
  "So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",
  "Just take off your shirt and tell us!",
  "Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?",
  "Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?",
  "If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",
  "Dan just moved in downstairs.",
  "Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!",
  "Okay, each team will answer ten questions.",
  "Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.",
  "Can, can I help you with something?",
  "So we can be friends who sleep together.",
  "Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.",
  "Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.",
  "All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.",
  "Don’t do this to me, again.",
  "Because patience is the road to understanding which ...  is the key... to a happy heart.",
  "There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out.",
  "Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",
  "Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.",
  "It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",
  "Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.",
  "Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",
  "Oh, I gotta go back in there.",
  "I�m very, very upset right now.",
  "Something about laboratory rats.",
  "Alright, we�ll just, uh, see when you get here.",
  "No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke.",
  "So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",
  "In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.",
  "Good, so everybody's here.",
  "He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",
  "Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?",
  "No reason, except…she…told…me.",
  "He dumped me the next day.",
  "Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",
  "I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere.",
  "I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.",
  "And when you enunciate, you spit!",
  "Doesn't she know me but at all!",
  "She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",
  "Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?",
  "I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...",
  "Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.",
  "He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform.",
  "Well, I started building one.",
  "We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.",
  "It's kind of a package deal!",
  "I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",
  "OK honey, you're dating Ross.",
  "I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",
  "Were you so late because you were burring this woman?",
  "Like he was really gonna send you one?",
  "Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.",
  "I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.",
  "Yeah, just like the one in the poem.",
  "That’s a good question, dad.",
  "Let's get down to business!",
  "Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",
  "You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.",
  "You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?",
  "I think I did something really stupid.",
  "Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",
  "I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!",
  "So, um, will you bring the truck?",
  "Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?",
  "Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing.",
  "yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.",
  "No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!",
  "Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.",
  "Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'",
  "You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.",
  "You gotta be at least bi...",
  "She-she thinks we’re engaged!",
  "We really do feel bad about this though.",
  "No watch how much she loves this.",
  "It could happen to anyone.",
  "Chandler just left though!",
  "Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God!",
  "Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!",
  "We’re not going to just sit.",
  "Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",
  "Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",
  "And I only made 200 dollars!",
  "So--You got in voluntarily?!",
  "I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time.",
  "Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.",
  "Finger sandwiches and tea.",
  "ahem... um... Crystal duck.",
  "The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?",
  "See, there you go, the cleansing works!",
  "I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.",
  "I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",
  "Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",
  "Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.",
  "He viscously screamed at total strangers!",
  "I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think.",
  "Your missing out on so much, Ross.",
  "I had the most amazing time with you.",
  "Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",
  "No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing.",
  "I don’t know, I don’t know.",
  "No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.",
  "It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",
  "See, I see.... big passion in your future.",
  "Oh no, I’ll be done by then.",
  "There was also leaves and guk and stuff.",
  "Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!",
  "Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.",
  "So, you don't think I'm terminal?",
  "Y’know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time.",
  "All right listen ball boys!",
  "And you didn�t even have the courtesy to tell me.",
  "Rachel is a very lucky girl.",
  "I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross.",
  "I’ll look forward to your call.",
  "And I do have one seat left.",
  "Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",
  "This is my apartment and I like it!",
  "On how far along he's in the sex change process!",
  "So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?",
  "Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!",
  "See, now it’s weird again.",
  "Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.",
  "Is it my bologna sandwich?",
  "This is the boarding call for Flight 009.",
  "You are, you're welling up.",
  "I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",
  "So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time.",
  "You gave me a tiney-wienie!",
  "Young Ethan: Then, what's the problem?",
  "You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.",
  "P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",
  "And you're thinking of taking it?",
  "Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.",
  "No, I have all of the good words.",
  "I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.",
  "I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.",
  "Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid.",
  "It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation!",
  "The neighbors ate all my candy!!",
  "You get to be the baby's father.",
  "Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.",
  "How do you get the mainsail up?",
  "Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.",
  "Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",
  "Y’know what else makes you wonder?",
  "I think I might need one more cup of coffee.",
  "What-what…what you guys doing here?!",
  "So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.",
  "It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it?",
  "Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.",
  "Once the egg descended the oviduct �",
  "Oh, my!Monica: I haven't really settled on a spot yet!",
  "Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.",
  "Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?",
  "This stop is Montreal.Woman On Train: I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes.",
  "That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony.",
  "Or you could teach stripping.",
  "Look at him, he’s so cute.",
  "Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.",
  "Yeah but, he’s not your type.",
  "Let me just see if I got this straight.",
  "But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.",
  "Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.",
  "I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk.",
  "Wow, you told your dad the truth.",
  "They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",
  "‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.",
  "Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.",
  "Ugh, can you believe that guy!",
  "You bought the beach house when I was 23!",
  "Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross.",
  "And umm, could you get me the pesto?",
  "No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.",
  "Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",
  "It’s coming from the bathroom.",
  "You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica.",
  "I can cook and you can take care of the money.",
  "So wait, what’s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can’t touch you?",
  "Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie.",
  "Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong.",
  "She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.",
  "And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you!",
  "You know, it's a rebuilding year.",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "I’m just really relived this whole thing is over.",
  "Of course, of course I do!",
  "Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night.",
  "I’ll get it for you right now.",
  "I'm never gonna find love again.",
  "But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",
  "I mean, I was sitting there.",
  "So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.",
  "I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",
  "Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",
  "Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",
  "The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",
  "You cannot tell him that!!",
  "Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!Hey!",
  "Maybe I should in with Monica!",
  "And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.",
  "Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",
  "Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.",
  "You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya.",
  "She didn't hang up either!",
  "Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",
  "I said we are not going to do it, okay?",
  "Well, you couldn’t get them anyway.",
  "I don’t care how long ago it was!",
  "So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.",
  "It starts with a \"v\" and ends with an \"x\".",
  "That means I’m stuck with, \"So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin’ right here!",
  "No, I got in trouble for that before.",
  "Good luck, with your girlfriend.",
  "I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say?",
  "Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!",
  "Does anybody want anything else?",
  "Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this.",
  "Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?",
  "We're going to a hospital.",
  "You opened all the presents without me?!",
  "I guess I was just nervous or something.",
  "Well, these really are the days of our lives.",
  "I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",
  "I’m not gonna marry Chandler!",
  "You guys this is so great!",
  "Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?",
  "You've got to live with it.",
  "I was tryin’ to make a sale!!",
  "Why are you looking at me like that?",
  "Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",
  "Well, what’s the next little bit?",
  "Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.",
  "The A.D: Yeah, we loves ‘em.",
  "Uh, could you leave me one?",
  "Any chance you think the couch looks good there?",
  "Come on, finish your enchilada.",
  "He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",
  "I can't believe you did this.",
  "Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years.",
  "Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.",
  "They took mine to give to you!",
  "Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",
  "Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?",
  "You are the worst ultimate fighter ever!",
  "Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!",
  "Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize!",
  "Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.",
  "Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?",
  "Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us!",
  "I think I may have  let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.",
  "And some biscottie cookies.",
  "Actually you were a big help tonight.",
  "Maybe it’s not as bad as I think.",
  "Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come.",
  "So uh, he seems like a nice guy.",
  "5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.",
  "I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.",
  "'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '",
  "I feel like it’s always me calling you.",
  "In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!",
  "Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.",
  "Here comes the beep, you know what to do.",
  "Trying to date this woman.",
  "Well, I guess you’re right.",
  "Monica, this is getting ridiculous!",
  "I threw her at his man nipples!",
  "I think I'm still in love with you.",
  "'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",
  "You know you don't want me to help.",
  "Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.",
  "It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.",
  "This is the part I'm actually good at.",
  "Your soulmate is out there, somewhere.",
  "That is how God intended it.",
  "I've been trying to call you.",
  "Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.",
  "I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.",
  "We should do it again sometime!",
  "Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!",
  "Yeah, I just have to get dressed.",
  "Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.",
  "Yeah, let�s celebrate life!",
  "Well when can we have this shower?",
  "I’m just so excited to make the presents!",
  "Oh, how well you know me...",
  "Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!",
  "Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",
  "Awww, just like you always wanted.",
  "Ross, I am not gonna run away again!",
  "Oh, really, let me see, let me see.",
  "I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all.",
  "I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.",
  "Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.",
  "Now, I can have milk everyday.",
  "Can you tell me how this happened?",
  "Well we think it’s absolutely marvelous that you’re having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded.",
  "This is all of your things.",
  "And then, then my cat died.",
  "Oh, I guess we could try that, but...  it seems so harsh!",
  "You were going to cut  me out?",
  "So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",
  "You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh?",
  "Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!",
  "You're really not coming back?",
  "And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",
  "There's something that you should know.",
  "How did you know I love Chinese?!",
  "We'd be eating our soup right now.",
  "I’m having my brother’s babies.",
  "Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.",
  "And then how you gonna feel?",
  "I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!",
  "How many, how many ah, did you sell?",
  "I'm a little younger than I said.",
  "So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?",
  "I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",
  "Don't you have a laundry room in your building?",
  "Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?",
  "So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?",
  "Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",
  "Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.",
  "The Sooner State, whatever that is.",
  "Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.",
  "And...  I want you to be happy.",
  "Were you sleeping sweetie?",
  "They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",
  "Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",
  "It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.",
  "They should put that on the box!",
  "It’ll make me feel so much better.",
  "Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.",
  "But we’ve only had one job.",
  "Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",
  "Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!",
  "And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!",
  "I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",
  "Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",
  "I might as well make some money out it!",
  "It didn't mean anything to me.",
  "We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me.",
  "I can’t do anymore than that.",
  "He can destroy the universe!",
  "At least give me a challenge!Oh.",
  "I’ve only met your partner Carol.",
  "People who’ve never ever been to Paris.",
  "Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?",
  "Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",
  "Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb.",
  "Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",
  "I guess if everybody else is...",
  "Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.",
  "It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.",
  "No matter how much we want it.",
  "You told me I can have six tickets!",
  "We have to find out which one the father is.",
  "Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?",
  "Don't cry, it's just a bit!",
  "It’s a real mustard-tastrophe.",
  "I watched the tape and passed it along  to my bosses and they weren't interested.",
  "This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.",
  "Y'know we haven’t actually met...",
  "Everyone’s all, \"Ross you have to be funny and sexy.\" Well, I proved them wrong!",
  "And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.",
  "Stop  staring at your sister's legs!",
  "I’m never gonna find anything.",
  "Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.",
  "Consider it  a contribution.",
  "So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",
  "Oh my God, you’re a genius!",
  "You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…",
  "I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.",
  "Ah yeah—wait a second now!",
  "Oh, I didn't go to college.",
  "No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.",
  "You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",
  "Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "I can't believe you let them win!",
  "Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?",
  "How, how are you going to face the other science guys?",
  "Hey Monica, here's your broom back.",
  "Uh, double latte, extra foam.",
  "Here, why don’t you let me do it?",
  "Surely you can think of something good.",
  "Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch  her tummy and give her a liver snout.",
  "What are you talking about?",
  "Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.",
  "Okay, we have our stripper.",
  "You're, you're, you're keeping me uppp!",
  "Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",
  "No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway.",
  "There’s no reason to get testy.",
  "Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!Think he washed his hands?",
  "Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",
  "The wires have come loose in your head!",
  "I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",
  "I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?",
  "Big Nosed Oh totally, totally.",
  "Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it.",
  "You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?",
  "Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.",
  "You know, if they're  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!",
  "Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!",
  "Oh, in that case— That was me hopping on board.",
  "God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?",
  "Last night I rolled a hard eight.",
  "I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",
  "Did Ross tell you not to let me go over  there?",
  "Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",
  "I can’t even see my own baby!",
  "Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!",
  "But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton.",
  "Get your foot off my contestant!",
  "I just got to talk to him about all this.",
  "\"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet.\" -- How did you know?",
  "Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!",
  "The Potential Roommate: Fight.",
  "This isn't easy for me either.",
  "I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.",
  "These are my night vision goggles.",
  "I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.",
  "Well, the key to your Porsche.",
  "Hey, you’re not going to believe this.",
  "Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss .",
  "And-and the interview part went so well, y'know?",
  "I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",
  "Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked.",
  "I didn't know Ross and you were so close.",
  "Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",
  "Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch.",
  "Wow, we really are bitches.",
  "Oh, will you give me the thing.",
  "I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian.",
  "Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why,  you cry and you cry and you cry.",
  "Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five.",
  "I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",
  "Maybe it's because it smells a little weird.",
  "It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",
  "No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.",
  "Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now.",
  "I can - I can babysit any time you want.",
  "Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too.",
  "Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow.",
  "Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles?",
  "Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now.",
  "Yeah, I’ll get right on that.",
  "Your not supposed to start with her!",
  "Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",
  "Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.",
  "I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.",
  "Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.",
  "No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.!",
  "Joey, you have to do me a favor.",
  "All right, here it goes...",
  "Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.",
  "There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but…",
  "That was some hot love you gave me!",
  "I don't have another level!!",
  "Well, you guys have been friends  forever.",
  "Oh, I forgot this was in here.",
  "I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",
  "Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",
  "But  maybe the time after that!",
  "Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",
  "Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.",
  "Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.",
  "But let me ask you one question...",
  "Let me help you with that.",
  "So, you gals wanna hand over your money now?",
  "I did not make out with him.",
  "I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",
  "This is my husband Crap Bag.",
  "Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?",
  "It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… Wow!",
  "He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?",
  "Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",
  "Y’know now it’s like…things are different.",
  "Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",
  "All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.",
  "So-so I went down to city hall and got these.",
  "I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this.",
  "Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory.",
  "Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.",
  "No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking.",
  "This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",
  "Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?",
  "Choked on his own moustache?",
  "I'll make it just like Mom's.",
  "You know.... You don't know!",
  "Of course, it was Michelle!",
  "I definitely don't wanna get married.",
  "I'm gonna pay for that tonight.",
  "My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney’s.",
  "Huh, I would’ve thought it was the other way around.",
  "Why don't we start with a practice run?",
  "Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.",
  "No, not cuddlily, not me, just her.",
  "Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.",
  "The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.",
  "Yes, you will be very sad.",
  "You completely stole my answer!",
  "Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?",
  "So are you actually gonna see her again?",
  "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.",
  "Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join  a cult are you?",
  "So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",
  "All right, say you do that.",
  "Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",
  "How long has she been crying?",
  "I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?",
  "No, this is a much better job.",
  "Big day Monday lots to do.",
  "Well you sure used a large font.",
  "Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"?",
  "Well, I guess now we can't go.",
  "Yeah, we want everyone to be there.",
  "Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",
  "No-no, he's, he's very docile.",
  "Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.",
  "Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things.",
  "Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?",
  "I think you'd remember that!",
  "I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",
  "Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?",
  "Do you think we should get it?",
  "Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now?",
  "But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",
  "Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay.",
  "I think I’m gonna stay here.",
  "I’ll guess just…I’ll come back.",
  "And I’m going to talk to them about it.",
  "It's throwing and catching!",
  "I hope you were using protection.",
  "Written by Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer",
  "I went thru this with Ben and Carol.",
  "So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.",
  "He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!",
  "It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.",
  "I'm mad at you for leaving!",
  "Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!",
  "And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot.",
  "Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago!",
  "Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",
  "You should get some sleep.",
  "Who are you kissing at midnight, huh?",
  "I am just  there for jury duty.",
  "How did you get in there?!",
  "Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times.",
  "Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",
  "So I’m gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.",
  "Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",
  "Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",
  "He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.",
  "Our little boy is getting married.",
  "Uhm, so but  anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever  made.",
  "And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay.",
  "Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",
  "Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",
  "Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",
  "Yeah, I’ve got something you can do.",
  "So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take",
  "Honey, sweetie, by the edges.",
  "Everything is broken down into categories, and then  cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms  in the back.",
  "Do you have my credit card?",
  "Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.",
  "Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.",
  "All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",
  "What the hell am I supposed to do!",
  "They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her.",
  "Can anything go right in my life?!",
  "Who are you saying \"check\" too?",
  "I don't care... I'll be my something blue.",
  "Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",
  "Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.",
  "Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.",
  "No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",
  "Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.",
  "Well Joey, I’m a headhunter.",
  "I thought you already have a job.",
  "Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?",
  "It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good.",
  "Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.",
  "Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!",
  "Well, we are ready to try anything.",
  "Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",
  "So no-no brothers and sisters, huh?",
  "What are you talking about?!",
  "But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",
  "And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?",
  "Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.",
  "The stripper stole the ring!!",
  "Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.",
  "Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.",
  "Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.",
  "Look, please, just come  on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you  won’t regret it.",
  "What happened to your date?",
  "Because  I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?",
  "Oh, somebody’s feeling better.",
  "Wait, now so you joined the gym?",
  "Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex.",
  "I should be laying down papers for you!",
  "That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!",
  "Are you gonna change yours?",
  "Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do.",
  "Um, Monica, you're scaring me.",
  "She’ll come around I promise.",
  "I’ve been trying to reach you all night.",
  "There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!",
  "All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man.",
  "Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.",
  "Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!",
  "Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",
  "Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?",
  "Rachel, that’s what they want me to do.",
  "I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?",
  "So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?",
  "And the world will never know.",
  "Because it's impossible to find her apartment!",
  "Mr Campbell: Dating profile?",
  "Mike's mom: No... It's lovely.",
  "It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",
  "But we are not the one she chose!",
  "Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!",
  "Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…",
  "Did you see the size of the closets?!",
  "I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.",
  "Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.You fall for it every time!",
  "Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have.",
  "I was thinking... since you wrote a song,  maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",
  "Yeah, didn�t I mention that?",
  "Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars.",
  "It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too.",
  "I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.",
  "Did everyone get out okay?",
  "It’s locked, you have to help me.",
  "I am so attracted to him right now.",
  "Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.",
  "I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....",
  "Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",
  "You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.",
  "No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.",
  "I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.",
  "Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...  with Emma... uhm... We just feel...",
  "Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!",
  "You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…",
  "Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?!",
  "Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!",
  "Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...",
  "And why are the drapes shut?!",
  "Who cares, we'll eat at the sink!",
  "And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...  When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...",
  "I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned.",
  "Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why  I hung it on the door.",
  "Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?",
  "Man, tough week for Estelle!",
  "In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",
  "Well, I’ve been up since six.",
  "We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse  us, and we're easily confused.",
  "How about just the bridemaids?",
  "Hey, you're a doctor of gums.",
  "Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",
  "I think it’s coming from your bag.",
  "Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.",
  ". Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why  I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.",
  "It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?",
  "Excuse me... This hospital is for people!",
  "You've been in my room before!",
  "The hunk of beef has feelings!",
  "The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",
  "Good for you Pheebs, way to go!",
  "She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all.",
  "Hey, do we do this too much?",
  "Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?",
  "Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",
  "And you’re still married to him?",
  "I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.",
  "Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  I kept slapping it away!",
  "Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy!",
  "Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",
  "But in very different ways.",
  "Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!",
  "Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.",
  "I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!",
  "Well, it's not like I went to Spain.",
  "So I guess now it's your turn again.",
  "How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",
  "Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",
  "And if she kisses me back, great!",
  "Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?",
  "It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called.",
  "Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.",
  "Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",
  "Yes, they can stay with us.",
  "Who says that wine has to cost  more than milk!",
  "Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl  for once.",
  "Because I think about you all the time.",
  "Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.",
  "That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more.",
  "You'll be answering the phones.",
  "Now we gotta get a divorce!!",
  "'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.",
  "This is a serious, legitimate movie.",
  "You've been counting wrong.",
  "I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?",
  "And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide.",
  "I'm not crying about that!",
  "Would you give me one minute!!",
  "Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!",
  "Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!",
  "Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend?",
  "No that is not what happened with us.",
  "No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",
  "I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",
  "I love the way you look every night Chandler!",
  "Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",
  "You really think that is what he meant?",
  "Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?",
  "It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.",
  "You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",
  "And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, \"I will always be with you,\" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.",
  "Yeah, I actually don’t know...",
  "\"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.\"",
  "Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.",
  "Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?",
  "Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.",
  "So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",
  "Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",
  "I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, \"This is so fantastic!",
  "But you-you’ve worked so hard…",
  "No, we kinda broke up instead.",
  "Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",
  "We didn’t get to the audition.",
  "I mean that switch is connected to something!",
  "Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die.",
  "Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",
  "I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.",
  "I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.",
  "The point is, I was right.",
  "Monica, I’m cutting you off.",
  "Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!",
  "I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle.",
  "I'm talking you up to people.",
  "We'll go with the burgundy.",
  "Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.",
  "Oh, I'm threatened by you?",
  "You guys have such problems!!",
  "What if I smack my head on the concrete?",
  "Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?",
  "Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",
  "You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.",
  "Oh no,  no, no, no, no, no.",
  "I'm doing this because I'm sorry?",
  "Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.",
  "Yeah, any messages for room 226?",
  "Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",
  "Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??",
  "Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have   worked out?",
  "This is getting ridiculous uh!",
  "Just raising her all alone.",
  "No, I was working on my pottery.",
  "I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.",
  "Just try to think of nice calm things...",
  "What exactly did he say to you?",
  "No, I stuff outside the bra.",
  "I thought they’d brighten up the place.",
  "That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…",
  "Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.",
  "Could you, could you try it without the purse?",
  "And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",
  "And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",
  "Oh, I’m having the best morning.",
  "I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do.",
  "Oh my, would you look at that!",
  "All right fine, I pick you.",
  "Why are you dressed as a gladiator?",
  "How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag?",
  "I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?",
  "I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.",
  "Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.",
  "Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?",
  "How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?",
  "I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!",
  "You can’t just go back a phase!",
  "Go take the test and see if we're okay.",
  "No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",
  "Let’s play some ball, guys.",
  "You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.",
  "Would you put that back on?!",
  "He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.",
  "What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",
  "I’m not a bachelor anymore.",
  "Come on, it’s not a big deal!",
  "I don’t want you to date her!",
  "Some can sing, some can dance.",
  "I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",
  "Well, I taught me and I love me.",
  "So, how did it go at the doctors?",
  "Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",
  "I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!",
  "Do you want me to be afraid of you?",
  "So umm, when do you want to meet him?",
  "Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like!",
  "Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.",
  "They won’t be ready for weeks.",
  "I mean, we should probably talk about that.",
  "Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.",
  "Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?",
  "You know what, we're gonna have sex.",
  "I thought I was something that we both wanted!",
  "Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?",
  "Hey what are you guys looking at?",
  "Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.",
  "That cute nibbly noise when she eats.",
  "We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother.",
  "but despite, you know... it got... it got good.",
  "Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!",
  "Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",
  "It’s not like it’s a big deal!",
  "Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",
  "Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.",
  "We should get them together and make a continuum.",
  "OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any  bigger?",
  "Did you know he was in there?",
  "Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?",
  "Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge?",
  "No, the little girl creeps me out.",
  "I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.",
  "He cannot do this to Phoebe.",
  "But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.",
  "Okay, that did not just happen!",
  "Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",
  "So Pheebs what’s this guy like?",
  "Hey, you know our phone's not working?",
  "I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.",
  "Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.",
  "Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.",
  "Frank Jr., and Alice got married!",
  "This is like Disneyland for me.",
  "Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on.",
  "Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",
  "I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",
  "He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.",
  "What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear.",
  "And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...?",
  "I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded.",
  "Ross, please don't hate me.",
  "Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.",
  "I just want him to love you like I do.",
  "And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",
  "You, you sure you need shoes?",
  "Molly ... people don't study acting ...",
  "People tell doctors everything.",
  "Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.",
  "Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.",
  "All right, that makes sense.",
  "You think that’s gonna work on me?!",
  "Who would I have to sleep with?",
  "He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this.",
  "Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing.",
  "Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just � she loves   it when I'm dramatic.",
  "The personal ad writes itself....",
  "Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?",
  "I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",
  "Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?",
  "I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",
  "I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while.",
  "It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know?",
  "Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",
  "Oh honey, but you love that name.",
  "Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.",
  "Well then get your money back and return them!",
  "But, by any chance did she find that funny?",
  "There has to be something that I can do!",
  "I'm just gonna grab a jacket.",
  "Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",
  "So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now.",
  "If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.",
  "Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.",
  "Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!",
  "Clearly not the way to go!!",
  "Do uh, do you like leather seats?",
  "Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",
  "Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!",
  "Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.",
  "No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",
  "This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!",
  "So, like, you guys all have jobs?",
  "I can't believe I never realized how great it is!",
  "That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.",
  "Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",
  "I'm just an empty vase, huh?",
  "Well, the lighting was okay.",
  "Joey, I did not break this!",
  "Come on help me move this.",
  "He is the man in the black dress.",
  "Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.",
  "Joey said that you're in here with another man.",
  "Oh no what if he marries her too?!",
  "We could put a hat on his head.",
  "I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.",
  "Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.",
  "Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",
  "Y’know what I think it is?",
  "Is this the one that I threw out last year?",
  "Now, would you both please start acting like adults?",
  "Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.",
  "Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",
  "You can't live without me.",
  "Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",
  "I’m not gonna let you cover for him.",
  "You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?",
  "It's my first national commercial!",
  "We have too much love and respect for one another.",
  "Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",
  "Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",
  "Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",
  "Y’know I would it’s just painful.",
  "Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",
  "Thought I'd give it a shot.",
  "So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.",
  "Right now you just need to get some rest.",
  "I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.",
  "Let me explain to you how the human body works.",
  "How about the whole animal rights thing?",
  "Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator.",
  "Do you know anything about women?",
  "You do realise that's your brother?",
  "I don’t like you going out with my daughter Ross.",
  "We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together  and things kind of unraveled.",
  "Let’s get you into wardrobe for a fitting.",
  "We’re seriously asking for our money back?",
  "Contraceptives are not always effective!",
  "I tried to reach you at work.",
  "Ready for your birthday lunch?",
  "Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.",
  "Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos",
  "Okay, there was some staring and pointing.",
  "You gotta get me out of here Phoebe!",
  "Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",
  "I just wanna make sure it fits.",
  "You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever.",
  "Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…",
  "Wow, I’ve admired your work for years.",
  "Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!",
  "So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.",
  "And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour!",
  "Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow!",
  "It was really so thoughtful of you.",
  "No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",
  "What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",
  "No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.",
  "Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends.",
  "Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that.",
  "Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?",
  "Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!",
  "You could kick anyone’s ass you want too.",
  "You don't live in this neighborhood.",
  "What do you mean you’re going to London?",
  "Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",
  "It’s not that kind of anniversary.",
  "Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…",
  "Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else!",
  "I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?",
  "Okay, you guys free tonight?",
  "I'm gonna go pack my ass off!",
  "I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?",
  "Now get out here!Hey Ross.",
  "I was just listening intently.",
  "Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…",
  "Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.",
  "I mean I—Joey I am out of control!!",
  "Is everybody getting married?!!",
  "Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.",
  "There is a man behind your curtain.",
  "Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.",
  "Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",
  "Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",
  "Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!",
  "It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!",
  "Mon, honey you’re not dying.",
  "I know, but, I made a huge mistake.",
  "And that's the end of the song...  I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen  minutes.",
  "Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.",
  "But the question is who’s gonna go first.",
  "It was only for a second, but... it was amazing.",
  "No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.",
  "I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.",
  "I�m gotta go to the bathroom.",
  "Chandler has two copies of Annie!",
  "Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.",
  "Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.",
  "I would be shopping... for a living!",
  "While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message  to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?",
  "Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.",
  "For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",
  "But that would've been so cool!",
  "What didn’t you tell us you work here?",
  "Okay, forget the specials for a minute.",
  "You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?",
  "Oh, I’m sorry honey, I’m so, so, haaaaaa!",
  "I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.",
  "Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",
  "I left my guitar in their apartment.",
  "About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",
  "She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff.",
  "I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...",
  "� Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry  about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.",
  "It looked like an eight, alright?",
  "Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool.",
  "I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.",
  "See, how can nobody want him?",
  "That only took me an hour.",
  "I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",
  "That’s why they trashed me!",
  "You-you’re gonna get married?!",
  "Stage Manager: Joey, onstage!",
  "Yeah, but I don’t know why.",
  "That’s a pretty small hole.",
  "Oh, I so can't believe this!",
  "Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.",
  "Mr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting.",
  "Hello, is this the creepy residence?",
  "When did I say you were boring?!",
  "Half the taste is in the smell!",
  "Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.",
  "Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...",
  "Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.",
  "Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",
  "Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?",
  "First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",
  "Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",
  "Rach, have you never done this before?",
  "Let's forget about Ross...",
  "Do you want me to check again?",
  "I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!",
  "I think I'm gonna take-off.",
  "I'm really looking forward to Saturday night!",
  "I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",
  "Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her.",
  "What you don’t think I’d go up to her?",
  "I brought you my old maternity clothes!",
  "Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",
  "Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.",
  "So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",
  "Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.",
  "You went out with Wallis Pincer?",
  "This is what it feels like to be right.",
  "Oh my god, I left the water running.",
  "This is absolutely amazing!",
  "Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.",
  "Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",
  "I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.",
  "Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…",
  "You’re not packed even a little bit!",
  "I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot.",
  "I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.",
  "Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",
  "Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",
  "And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back!",
  "So you're gonna call this one back?",
  "Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too.",
  "You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?",
  "And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.",
  "I mean you were just… You’re so incredible!",
  "Excuse me, I’m standing right here!",
  "You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.",
  "Do you need me to go with you?",
  "Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.",
  "And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.",
  "Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.",
  "Nobody could steal me from you.",
  "Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, \"Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.\"",
  "I don’t wanna hear \"Three failed marriages!\"",
  "Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
  "That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!",
  "I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with  it...",
  "You sure this is what you want?",
  "You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec.",
  "It really creeps me out when you call it that!",
  "But that's  not what I'm here to talk to you about.",
  "Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",
  "Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving?",
  "I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.",
  "Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!",
  "Originally written by Adam Chase.",
  "Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!",
  "You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up.",
  "I’m not doing them this time!",
  "Is there anything we should know about the apartment?",
  "Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept.",
  "We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.",
  "That makes up for everything!",
  "What's Ross doing to you on that picture?",
  "Man, you are Westminster Crabby.",
  "Who got her condo in Boca?",
  "Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.",
  "Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that.",
  "It’s not like it’s a real marriage.",
  "How’d you whined up there?",
  "Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it.",
  "You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!",
  "Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...",
  "No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",
  "I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.",
  "Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.",
  "Got my little happy helpers.",
  "Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",
  "Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!",
  ". . I don't really like to  talk about it.MIKE:� So, you're a paleontologist, right?",
  "You know what you should do?",
  "Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious  relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you  go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience  never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.",
  "Oh, I don’t watch soap operas.",
  "Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'",
  "Ross, I really don’t think…",
  "I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.",
  "Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.",
  "What do you need from the car?",
  "I think I might know what this is about.",
  "Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady.",
  "Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?",
  "Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away.",
  "I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life.",
  "Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.",
  "Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?",
  "I really, really am sorry.",
  "So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",
  "That's 'cause you have it.",
  "What’s uh, what’s going on?",
  "Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!",
  "Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",

  "What’s wrong with being the Bings?",
  "You can’t have sex with her!",
  "Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",
  "Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this?",
  "Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.",
  "Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!",
  "Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",
  "I just can't believe this is happening.",
  "What if she jumped out the bassinet?",
  "How can you not believe in evolution?",
  "You guys are gonna be so happy!",
  "You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh?",
  "Let’s not talk about that right now?",
  "Oh my God, that was for my benefit?",
  "Hey, uh, you can ignore that.",
  "Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya.",
  "..I dunno, a little too Alan?",
  "Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die.",
  "Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!",
  "Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.",
  "Am I supposed to be laughing?",
  "Chandler, this actually bothers you?",
  "Uff, I hope he lets her down easy.",
  "- Alright look, you want me to say it?",
  "Only if I don't have to get up and sing.",
  "That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",
  "What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and  partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm  there, It's just, I really miss you.",
  "Happy Holidays, here's your joy.",
  "I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.",
  "Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.",
  "Aww, look at the little thing.",
  "It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.",
  "No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.",
  "I was the James Michener of dirty talk.",
  "Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",
  "You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!",
  "You have a Miss Monica Geller here.",
  "You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!",
  "And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.",
  "But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",
  "I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!",
  "Hold Voice: Please, stay on the line.",
  "Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",
  "Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass!",
  "Look at those strong hands.",
  "No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",
  "Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",
  "No, no, no, we’re not married.",
  "Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",
  "Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",
  "Can you help me clean this up?",
  "Oh… Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one?",
  "I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.",
  "Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!",
  "Is your finger caught in that chair?",
  "Do you have anything her for $10.",
  "No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.",
  "Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?",
  "I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!",
  "Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!",
  "Well we…we don’t have a garage.",
  "Well my guy is spectacular.",
  "No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in.",
  "So, I walk in the door and make  the right",
  "Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.",
  "This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",
  "I think I may even try to get out of here early.",
  "I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",
  "What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",
  "I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.",
  "No, I know, but I—he just went on.",
  "Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.",
  "I know, I’m so sorry for you!",
  "Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!",
  "I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",
  "You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.",
  "You’re a really good kisser.",
  "Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…",
  "Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite.",
  "Danny's Sister: Oh, I thought I heard you.",
  "I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer!",
  "I can't believe I didn't get it!",
  "Have you guys been listening this entire time?",
  "Did he have to come straight from the office?",
  "Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",
  "Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",
  "Yeah, he’s really great though.",
  "Well, they don't have to know that...",
  "I mean, who is she to judge us?",
  "Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding.",
  "And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad.",
  "But enough about me, come on!",
  "I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...",
  "I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there!",
  "Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",
  "Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--",
  "And I think I'm doing better.",
  "Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon.",
  "Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",
  "Joey's Hand Twin: Please, please take him too.",
  "Fireman #2: No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom.",
  "Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...",
  "Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.",
  "Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going  to make excellent parents.",
  "Well then honey, buy the lamp!",
  "I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!",
  "Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious.",
  "I don't think that's his name.",
  "Why is everything different?",
  "Um, what's say you and I give it another shot?",
  "Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!?",
  "All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay.",
  "Monica put something in our oven this morning.",
  "I took care of the babies all by myself!",
  "That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it.",
  "All right let's just do this.",
  "Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!",
  "You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!",
  "Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!",
  "Every thing's--they're fine.",
  "But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.",
  "I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!",
  "And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired?",
  "No Rach, it’s not just you.",
  "Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.",
  "She must’ve read the cards wrong!",
  "And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes?",
  "Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women.",
  "Unless you wanna stay over?",
  "A-a-and  good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.",
  "Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...",
  "I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.",
  "Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.",
  "Try under the bed, try under the bed!",
  "yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't  been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month.",
  "Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",
  "Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",
  "You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",
  "I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",
  "Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.",
  "No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.",
  "The premiere is next week and you’re all invited!",
  "Love is the best medicine.",
  "Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me!",
  "Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.",
  "Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.",
  "Okay, everybody stay here.",
  "We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.",
  "I don't know which one of you guys to pick.",
  "Thanks for helping me man.",
  "No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's  uhm... my issue.",
  "You just click when they click.",
  "Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper?",
  "Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.",
  "Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it.",
  "I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.",
  "Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants.",
  "What is Joey’s favorite food?",
  "Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President.",
  "In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies.",
  "Sure Just not as much as clams.",
  "It’s because that way the camera only sees her!",
  "It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",
  "I hope she'll be very happy.",
  "When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!",
  "No-no ah, everything's okay.",
  "Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!",
  "I mean how crazy would that be?",
  "All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors.",
  "I can’t do this, I can’t give him up.",
  "Hey, y’know what I was thinking?",
  "Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",
  "Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?",
  "Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",
  "I don’t want him to tell this story for years.",
  "Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.",
  "That would be a good idea.",
  "She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...",
  "What, because that’s your answer to everything?",
  "He kinda did it to himself.",
  "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "All right, so what were you thinking?",
  "I learned that living on the street.",
  "Third wife sold separately.",
  "Aww, like I could hurt you.",
  "I thought I told you not to come.",
  "I know, she's been such a big part of my life.",
  "No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",
  "At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",
  "This is so much fun, just the girls.",
  "I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.",
  "Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.",
  "You're making a big mistake here.",
  "No, we haven't seen her since this morning.",
  "You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",
  "Uh-huh, Carol, so were we.",
  "Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",
  "And that’s not against your oath?!",
  "They did it right there on the couch.",
  "From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word  for danger.",
  "Give him the money and get their table!",
  "Do you got your gracious loser face?",
  "I’m not gonna let you get away with this!",
  "Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.",
  "Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.",
  "Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me.",
  "So uh, what are you guys doing?",
  "So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.",
  "Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God!",
  "Yes, what’s the name, please?",
  "Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.",
  "They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that.",
  "And that’s why I’m under the table.",
  "Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?",
  "Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you.",
  "I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women.",
  "So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?",
  "And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!",

  "I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career.",
  "um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to...  Listen, let me do this alright?",
  "If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.",
  "When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you?",
  "I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.",
  "We didn't know how you were going to react.Okay, all right, whew!",
  "Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…",
  "I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.",
  "Uh huh...we're playing you two.",
  "Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!",
  "Really, can I hear some of it.",
  "Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.",
  "Oh God okay, just imagine this, \"The Pam.\"",
  "That does not sound stupid to me.",
  "Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.",
  "Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?",
  "It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.",
  "Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",
  "Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?",
  "Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.",
  "The Security Guard: I'm just taking you outside!",
  "But we don’t know the neighbors.",
  "Yeah, this has happened before.",

  "How about in that cabinet?",
  "My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.",
  "I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy.",
  "And your horoscope says, \"On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.\"Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.",
  "All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.",
  "\"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel\".",
  "You’re gonna call out her name and say, \"I love you!\" And she’s gonna say, \"I love you, too!\" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",

  "Phoebe, of course there is more!",
  "Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.",
  "Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!",
  "Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?",
  "Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.",
  "Why don’t you stick around.",
  "Well, I have your address and phone number.",
  "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.",
  "Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me.",
  "I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",
  "I think your Dad must’ve added wrong.",
  "Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain  turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",
  "Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better.",
  "But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown.",
  "Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it.",
  "Well, I see you've had a very productive day.",
  "I think that's a little weird, y'know?",
  "Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.",
  "Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?",
  "Damnit woman we’re losing precious time!",
  "Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?",

  "As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!He-he does not like it!",
  "Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?",
  "No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants.",
  "Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",
  "That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today.",
  "Oh, let me push, can I push?",
  "With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!",
  "Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you.",
  "What’s your favourite thing about summertime?",
  "Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city?",
  "Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.",
  "Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’",
  "You guys, I am not that bad!",
  "You mean, when you were a baby.",
  "Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",
  "Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",
  "I didn’t know if you were telling people.",
  "Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments.",
  "Why don’t you ask him out?",
  "I’m getting married July 25th.",
  "The coast’s all the way over there.",
  "Oh, look what we almost left.",

  "There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.",
  "Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",
  "It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money.",
  "Sure, because women never like Joey.",
  "I mean the chance to star in a movie?",
  "No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian.",
  "After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.",
  "I didn’t realize that she was so close.",
  "The Woman From Poughkeepsie: Ross!",
  "Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now!",
  "You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.",
  "You can live in the thumb.",
  "I'm sorry, I was an idiot.",
  "That's right, she came back all by herself.",
  "I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.",
  "It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster.",
  "Fat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!",
  "Do you have any Chap Stick?",
  "I can’t believe she’s really gone.",
  "I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
  "\"No bigger!\" \"You're perfect!\" \"Just  don't get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling  coach.",
  "I'm thinking of getting me one of those.",
  "All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth.",
  "Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with.",
  "Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could  go and get the cake.",
  "I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat!",
  "I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but… Okay, why not?",
  "Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",
  "I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.",
  "What do you need, what do you need?",
  "You go learn from your qualified instructor!",
  "That’s what I keep saying.",
  "So I really never get to win anymore?",
  "Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",
  "I mean what, what am I gonna do?",
  "Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",
  "And you're gonna make them all disappear.",
  "This money is for the poor.",
  "Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.",
  "A classic sign of love, the hug!",
  "I feel like my face is swelling.",
  "We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",
  "You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",
  "What does she think of your little science project?",
  "Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?",
  "Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",
  "You must have been a teenage when you had him.",
  "Charlton Heston: Joey, right?",
  "Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",
  "How can I watch him get married?",
  "Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?",
  "There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us!",
  "Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",
  "Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.",
  "But the minute we start to lie to each other… And by 'we' I mean society.",
  "Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.",
  "Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",
  "Does a good teacher say, \"Put down the beer pinhead!?\"",
  "Startin’ to feel her again there are we?",
  "You put holes in my baby's ears!",
  "Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here.",
  "I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.",
  "Fine, y’know what, that’s it.",
  "All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.",
  "It is when you put it together with that one.",
  "I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.",
  "Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.",
  "Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",
  "Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…",
  "I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.",
  "I guess we should get going!",
  "Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.",
  "I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!",
  "I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given.",
  "Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not.",
  "Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better.",
  "I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six  years.",
  "Hey Pheebs, how's it going?",
  "He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags.",
  "Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.",
  "In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on   the house.",
  "I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.",
  "I want you to met some friends of mine.",
  "Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... be?",
  "These, these are Joey’s sisters.",
  "Someone's a little cranky today cuz  they have to do it in a cup! .",
  "And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy’s head.",
  "I don’t know, something girlie.",
  "Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time.",
  "And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.",
  "Sorry...we were just leaving",
  "May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands!",
  "Or if you prefer, this table is available.",
  "Well, what are you going to wear?",
  "Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!",
  "Did he get in touch with Emily?",
  "Well, I don't know what else to do.",
  "Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.",
  "Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know?",
  "Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",
  "No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",
  "Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?",
  "I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you.",
  "I smoked for years, then I quit.",
  "That’s where we keep the canned goods!",
  "Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...",
  "Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!",
  "I think I broke your bowl.",
  "Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything.",
  "She is going to freak…out.",
  "Actually she’s my-my boss.",
  "So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",
  "We’ll be... Well your  grandfather and I might not be here.",
  "How can your genitals make phone calls?",
  "I feel really strongly about this, Rachel.",
  "How do you even know a woman like that?",
  "Originally written by Betsy Bornes Transcribed by Joshua Hodge.",
  "It-it'll be way too complicated.",
  "Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?",
  "They fired me and then out  of nowhere they just hire me back!",
  "Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know!",
  "Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.",
  "Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",
  "Don't point your finger at me.",
  "Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here.",
  "You bet I did, Ben, put it there!",
  "The You, get out of my shop!",
  "Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.",
  "But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross!",
  "Parents divorced before you hit puberty.",
  "Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?",
  "Yeah, I thought you knew that.",
  "We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.",
  "Probably right before she lost it!",
  "Why, why, why would you dream that?",
  "There's  three of them, Phoebe, three!",
  "I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out.",
  "And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off.",
  "I’m glad we got that all straightened out.",
  "That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.",
  "Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have  to give me your key just because...",
  "I’m being smart about this.",
  "Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.",
  "All right, that’s it, you guys!",
  "What was the other one Ross?",
  "Well then you have his baby.",
  "I thought she was marrying Connor!",
  "Why don’t we start right now!",
  "Well, it wasn't just me, alright?",
  "So how come Richard's selling the place?",
  "'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no.",
  "Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put.",
  "Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!",
  "I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?",
  "Thanks for going along with this.",
  "All right then, your bra would still be big.",
  "Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?",
  "Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you.",
  "Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down!",
  "Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!",
  "You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.",
  "You’re having our baby.Do you feel better?",
  "Okay, Monica: Right foot red.",
  "Whoa—hey—wh—wh—what do you got there?",
  "Look at you, you won't even look at him.",
  "Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross.",
  "But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.",
  "Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.",
  "Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",
  "So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off.",
  "Judge all you want to but,",
  "Why would the little girl creep you out?",
  "Well, you seem pretty insulted by that.",
  "And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.",
  "Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",
  "Ross, did you really read all these baby books?",
  "You still work at the multiplex?",
  "Stop forcing that thing on her.",
  "Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",
  "Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.",
  "Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife.",
  "You guys are never going to believe this.",
  "Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",
  "You can slip it under my door.",
  "I don't know, I'm very tired.",
  "God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!",
  "And that was a great movie!",
  "You forgot fourteen states?",
  "You in the mood for, uh, something grape?",
  "Wow, look at these prices.",
  "Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",
  "Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?",
  "It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something?",
  "Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve?",
  "There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",
  "Well, I'm crazy about her now.",
  "Okay, I'll see you at the station later.",
  "No, we’re just four people with neck problems.",
  "uhm... Is everything okay?",
  "It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?",
  "I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",
  "Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.",
  "I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?",
  "Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!",
  "Hey, who's this little naked guy?",
  "Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.",
  "I mean, weddings start late.",
  "Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?",
  "I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…",
  "You were my first kiss with Rachel?",
  "Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?",
  "You know, I might know somebody.",
  "Okay, but this is the last time.",
  "You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.",
  "Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...",
  "I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.Man on TV: Yeah, just relax.",
  "Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",
  "Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?",
  "Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going.",
  "And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"",
  "If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.",
  "I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to",
  "No, I’m really okay with this.",
  "How do you feel about that?",
  "Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?",
  "Hey there, you handsome thing.",
  "What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.",
  "I think we've found our sperm!",
  "So wait, what precinct are you with?",
  "Santa has reindeers that can fly!",
  "Even if we were friends who lived together.",
  "So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?",
  "Well, why do you call him Gandolf?",
  "Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this?",
  "I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do.",
  "She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name!",
  "Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second.",
  "We, you with someone and me with someone.",
  "Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.",
  "you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...",
  "Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your  rent is.",
  "Well, you have to go back in.",
  "Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial.",
  "The same thing  happened again!",
  "All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed.",
  "Delivery Girl: Hi Chandler!",
  "I just don�t think I can bear it.",
  "Guess whose middle name is Muriel.",
  "But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.",
  "Ok, well, this was very special.",
  "Tell Monica I say goodbye.",
  "You have tears in your eyes.",
  "I just, I can't believe you're calling me?",
  "So he has to be a male who has at least $50.",
  "Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?",
  "I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",
  "Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.",
  "I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!",
  "All right, this isn’t so bad.",
  "You’re not gonna mess it up.",
  "I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago!",
  "Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?",
  "Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit.",
  "Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either.",
  "Umm, not without you, lover.",
  "I Think last night was great.",
  "Look, maybe we should take a break.",
  "Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",
  "That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.",
  "You do realize that you won’t have access to our new full service Swedish spa.",
  "Yeah, I know that means buddy!",
  "Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.",
  "I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump?",
  "At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too.",
  "But I don’t want to know that it-it never could.",
  "Crushes happen all the time!",
  "Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.",
  "And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",
  "I know, I hate being left out of things.",
  "Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.",
  "Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",
  "Well, you can understand, given how we started.",
  "Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?",
  "MONICA: No, I will not cave.",
  "Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump?",
  "Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller.",
  "I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",
  "We're all gonna do something tonight.",
  "Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.",
  "Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",
  "I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?",
  "Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?",
  "Alright, so Mike's on his way over.",
  "So I guess it’s Joey then!",
  "I don’t know, it looks the same.",
  "Because it’s really doing nothing for me.",
  "And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!",
  "No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?",
  "Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?",
  "So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.",
  "If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",
  "Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",
  "Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.",
  "She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",
  "Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.",
  "If you wanna put a label on it.",
  "I’m getting married today!!",
  "It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore.",
  "Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?",
  "Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",
  "Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules!",
  "Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",
  "So why can’t the three of us go out together?",
  "Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?",
  "I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much?",
  "Why did you look at me when you said that?",
  "I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.",
  "Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",
  "You really had me going there!",
  "They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!",
  "Minor additions and adjustments by Dan SIlverstein.",
  "Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later.",
  "Well, if you see him could you please tell  him I'm looking for him?",
  "We just live in the same building.",
  "I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.",
  "I didn't get to the bathroom.",
  "Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?",
  "Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents.",
  "Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.",
  "Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?",
  "I thought your dad took away your credit card.",
  "Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him.",
  "I can't believe that Ross is gone.",
  "You look beautiful this evening.",
  "Can you believe no-one between my apartment  and here offered to do that for me?",
  "Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.",
  "Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",
  "Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots.",
  "Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.",
  "All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",
  "Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.",
  "Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?",
  "The groom cannot see the bride!",
  "Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.",
  "I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough.",
  "But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.",
  "All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.",
  "And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?",
  "And-and you’re using my name!",
  "What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you  can't do it at a doctor's office?",
  "Come  on Ross jr. It's time to go in.",
  "I'm takin' Ursula tonight.",
  "Hey, the man’s dog just died.",
  "What-what are you doing tomorrow night?",
  "She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.",
  "What's that, water breaking?",
  "Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",
  "Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!",
  "If you ask me to stay, I�ll pee.",
  "And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you.",
  "I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.",
  "ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt.",
  "Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.",
  "I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.",
  "Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!",
  "Well, let’s see, it’s not.",
  "What-what are you guys doing here?",
  "Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.",
  "I really think I might kill someone tonight.",
  "Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",
  "I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",
  "Can I talk to you for a second?",
  "Why do you have to break up with her?",
  "Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place?",
  "Okay, what room number is he in?",
  "You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone.",
  "Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",
  "Then what are you going to put on top of that?",
  "Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!",
  "First my marriage falls apart and then…",
  "That is totally different for two reasons.",
  "Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.",
  "No, it’s not what I want either.",
  "If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together.",
  "You must smell a lot of the time too.",
  "Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning!",
  "We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out.",
  "But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey.",
  "I have a job interview I have to get ready for.",
  "I don't know why Joey had to kiss her!",
  "I'm just so tired of-of missing him.",
  "Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",
  "Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",
  "That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.",
  "Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore  on Madison Avenue.",
  "Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant.",
  "Well, it was nice meeting all of you.",
  "Okay ah, please don’t freak out.",
  "How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?",
  "Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give.",
  "Okay, hold on just a second.",
  "Well, I think I can help you get over him.",
  "Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong.",
  "Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!",
  "It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping.",
  "So you told people I was pregnant?!",
  "You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London.",
  "What are you trying on now?",
  ": \"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!\"",
  "But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.",
  "Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara.",
  "Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",
  "Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm.",
  "Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!",
  "Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand.",
  "Just uh, brought back your videos.",
  "Okay, umm, her name is Carol.",
  "Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.",
  "Tag's still talking to the police.",
  "It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",
  "'Cause, it's, it's really old.",
  "Are you sure you wanna do this?",
  "Well that’s important to me.",
  "I’m getting a lot of use out of them already!",
  "Remember last night I told you to take them?",
  "Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.",
  "Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened?",
  "Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, \"It’s Not Too Late.\"",
  "I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!",
  "C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.",
  "Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh!",
  "So you uh, have a…big work problem?",
  "We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other.",
  "Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…",
  "You think we're ready for something like that?",
  "They called me chicken boy.",
  "Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",
  "Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",
  "Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.",
  "Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?",
  "Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now.",
  "You could try... but you would not be successful.",
  "Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing?",
  "Right that's why I came over to talk about.",
  "I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.",
  "Come on Rach, let’s give it another try.",
  "Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",
  "Listen I uh… Rachel Green will you marry me?",
  "Course there, they just call it food.",
  "You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?",
  "Didn't you listen to the story?",
  "You know how you always think you're great in bed?",
  "Tell me, what does your father do?",
  "I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.",
  "I'm telling you, he's great!",
  "Someone knocked over a lamp.",
  "No, I don’t want to tell you.",
  "Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",
  "Do you want to fall into the trap?!",
  "No, I-I-I’m serious, okay?",
  "Well, why don’t you just start with something simple.",
  "Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?",
  "Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",
  "That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.",
  "Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",
  "I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.",
  "Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?",
  "We register, and you get to keep all the presents!",
  "Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then!",
  "Honey, relationships are hard.",
  "And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me.",
  "They said it could be up to a year.",
  "After everything he said, he'd go \"ba dum bum chessh\"",
  "Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet.",
  "I must’ve hit something on the remote.",
  "It’ll be great for next weekend.",
  "Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.",
  "I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",
  "Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",
  "Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful  life together.",
  "Well, that's neither here nor there.",
  "And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'",
  "You know, he  normally doesn't drink like this.",
  "You don’t get a say in this!",
  "Hums While He Pees: I know it’s really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and—Oh no!",
  "It’s not something you are!",
  "Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.",
  "How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.",
  "Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?",
  "Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.",
  "Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.",
  "Can I see that for second.",
  "Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",
  "I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!",
  "Well you should be embarrassed.",
  "Man, how did you afford this stuff?",
  "You won’t boss me around anymore?",
  "okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.",
  "Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.",
  "You almost crushed my hat!",
  "That's all the turkey you're gonna get.",
  "But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.",
  "Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",
  "Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",
  "You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen.",
  "How many fingers am I holding up?",
  "Hey, mind if I use the phone?",
  "Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",
  "Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",
  "I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.",
  "Hey, I only got one good arm, you know.",
  "It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day.",
  "What, what are you jealous?",
  "All right, I guess this will be fine.",
  "Maybe Monica used to use them with...",
  "I think you can still make it.",
  "You asked all those insightful, great questions.",
  "Give me a call if you want.\"",
  "So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",
  "This is where you guys belong.",
  "I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!",
  "All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.",
  "I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.",
  "All right, how about the ladybugs?",
  "I say you show this guy what you're made of.",
  "I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.",
  "Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!",
  "Man in the black dress… Hi!",
  "Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples!",
  "My girlfriend is out there thinking things over!",
  "Okay, I-I-I'll be right over.",
  "I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.",
  "Get the hell out of there, y’know?Well, look at that, same thing.",
  "I-I-I think you look great.",
  "That was some-something huh?",
  "Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",
  "I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.",
  "I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",
  "Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!",
  "Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",
  "Maybe they could change the message.",
  "So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.",
  "And another time after that.",
  "Her date tipped me ten dollars.",
  "Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.",
  "I bet I stopped listening before you did.",
  "Okay, all right, give me the mug!",
  "Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement.",
  "Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?",
  "Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat.",
  "Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say.",
  "Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.",
  "Great, now I'm having a baby.",
  "So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?",
  "But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women.",
  "OK, I am calling your seventeen.",
  "Hey, so are you sure your ready to go.",
  "A joke they would appreciate?",
  "I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.",
  "I don’t think the next patient is very far along.",
  "They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",
  "Oh, I think I saw some in here.",
  "Well, that's sort of a given, but yes.",
  "Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.",
  "Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.",
  "I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.",
  "Oh, and I have something for  you!",
  "Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.",
  "He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",
  "You only get one more, Mike!",
  "I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and  all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my  life with you.",
  "This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.",
  "Look at it this way: you dumped her.",
  "Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…",
  "Are you talking about the Dewar grant?",
  "No, I’m not ready for this!",
  "Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",
  "Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.",
  "There's lots of flavors out there.",
  "Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",
  "No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not.",
  "Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here!",
  "All my energy is going into not asking that question.",
  "So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",
  "You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",
  "I am definitely gonna watch that!",
  "I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft.",
  "We don’t care about where we stay.",
  "I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna  be?",
  "I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting.",
  "What's up with the simian?",
  "I have a very wide pelvis.",
  "All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",
  "Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.",
  "We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.",
  "Originally written by Jeffrey Astroff and Mike Sikowitz Transcribed by Josh Hodge.",
  "It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.",
  "Okay... Let me put it this way.",
  "Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?",
  "You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment.",
  "I don't wanna be drunk when I go home   alone.",
  "So basically this is very easy.",
  "Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.",
  "Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",
  "You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",
  "I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.",
  "Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?",
  "Don't you think it's time you went home?!",
  "It’s not so silly anymore!",
  "I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!",
  "He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.",
  "Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know?",
  "I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe.",
  "Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?",
  "Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?",
  "That-that’s why you’re here!",
  "Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.",
  "Come on, I used all my best stuff!",
  "What are they doing out here?",
  "Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it.",
  "The Yes, it was very offensive to my people!",
  "Let me ask you one question.",
  "Ooh, you should come with me!",
  "There might be doctors there.",
  "All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.",
  "Although I was hoping to   have sex tonight.",
  "Hi, um, I’m err, ..who’s next?",
  "Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight.",
  "I almost forget the tickets, didn’t I?",
  "My late husband gave me that lighter.",
  "I’m going medieval on prices!",
  "How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’t melt.",
  "No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",
  "Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",
  "Oh, she looks just like a little doll!",
  "Alright babe, deal the cards.",
  "I can't believe we are even having this discussion.",
  "We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",
  "�Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!",
  "Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.",
  "Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?",
  "I’ve never been more scared in all my life!",
  "Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.",
  "Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest.",
  "No, what's that all about?",
  "No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.",
  "Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers…",
  "All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.",
  "Not just restaurants, from our house.",
  "I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!",
  "So just fix whatever she wants fixed.",
  "When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk.",
  "No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… Hold on one second; let me check this out.",
  "Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",
  "Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",
  "Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?",
  "Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?",
  "But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him.",
  "No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?",
  "Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!",
  "Let them see what a great guy you still are.",
  "Why would you want to do that?",
  "It was just the two of us.",
  "Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.",
  "Can you believe this is already happening?",
  "Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",
  "All right, I’ll pick that one.",
  "My God, I can’t believe this!",
  "Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.",
  "I would have told him to do it too.",
  "You don’t have to say anything.",
  "I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it …",
  "Girls Chandler could never get?",
  "Joey's Hand Twin: Nothing?",
  "What... I could, I could do it.",
  "It’s-it’s uh a real thing!",
  "Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman!",
  "Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.",
  "Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",
  "I was just going to get dressed.",
  "You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.",
  "Yeah, that does make sense.",
  "I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?",
  "Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler.",
  "I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…",
  "Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,",
  "I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.",
  "It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",
  "Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.",
  "Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!",
  "They’re…they’re-they’re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.",
  "No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.",
  "sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a  part of this.",
  "How often does this happen to you, huh?",
  "Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.",
  "Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",
  "Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.",
  "You’re hiding behind the coats.",
  "Now that you told  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",
  "Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",
  "Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.",
  "Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"",
  "And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.",
  "Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.",
  "So uh, what did this woman look like?",
  "But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",
  "She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",
  "Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me!",
  "Ok, so, ok, was he holding you?",
  "Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",
  "Oh, and he’s got such a good heart!",
  "Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...",
  "It's gotta be better than that book.",
  "\"I'm a little bit country\"...",
  "If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!",
  "Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that�s true.",
  "Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?",
  "Dude, two times that happened!",
  "You’re gonna love her so much.",
  "I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",
  "That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",
  "Did Monica borrow money from you?",
  "That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",
  "Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here.",
  "And I've already  talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever  we need to make us feel comfortable.",
  "Oh God… Why don’t they put chairs back here?!",
  "Oh right, tonight was your party.",
  "Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",
  "No, I want everything you just said.",
  "Tell her about us last year.",
  "Making holiday candy for the neighbors.",
  "We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.",
  "Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.",
  "The Woman Dealer: I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.",
  "I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.",
  "Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!",
  "I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.",
  "That my friends is my New Year's resolution.",
  "Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",
  "But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",
  "I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!",
  "If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",
  "No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",
  "Same as yesterday, same as the day before.",
  "The ones that got me the Porsche!",
  "Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",
  "And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.",
  "Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?",
  "I don’t know, let me think.",
  "There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel.",
  "Y’know, like where are we?",
  "The girl from the Xerox place buck naked",
  "Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night?",
  "Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again.",
  "I can't believe you would say that!",
  "Nothing I do means anything, really.",
  "Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",
  "Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him.",
  "I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...  you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.",
  "Maybe she’ll be gone for months.",
  "Why are you so jealous of me?",
  "But y'know, it doesn't count.",
  "She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",
  "I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or  something.",
  "Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.",
  "Actually they were Nana's.",
  "Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?",
  "Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.",
  "Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.",
  "Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions.",
  "In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year!",
  "Now that she broke up with you?",
  "Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.",
  "I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!",
  "To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…",
  "Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural.",
  "That’s all right, we-we don’t need you.",
  "Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be   appropriate to give me this.",
  "And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",
  "All that stuff you just said?",
  "And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers.",
  "Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",
  "Richard’s Date: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived.",
  "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again!",
  "Listen, we-we have to have dinner.",
  "I don't care what society says.",
  "You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up.",
  "You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula.",
  "All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.",
  "And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.",
  "It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",
  "Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby.",
  "All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant  in a couple hours.",
  "Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman!",
  "But I can turn that around!",
  "Well.... it is amouz-ing...Ten dollars an hour for what?",
  "Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?",
  "Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening.",
  "Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.",
  "So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?",
  "Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though.",
  "It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow!",
  "Does  it look like this is my first time, huh?",
  "Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",
  "The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe.",
  "So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore.",
  "Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.",
  "Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.",
  "Alex, remember you’re supposed to cry.",
  "Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie!",
  "That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",
  "Why do we have to talk about the future?",
  "Hey, Ross, quick question for ya.",
  "Ohh, you know who you should go with?",
  "Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.",
  "You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!Check it out.",
  "Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught.",
  "I mean, what skills do you have?",
  "Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.",
  "Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square.",
  "We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.",
  "Okay, so that’s why you’re…",
  "Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll Joey Trrrribbiani!",
  "Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?",
  "So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.",
  "No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.",
  "Totally and completely healthy!",
  "Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",
  "Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike.",
  "But to hell with that bitch.",
  "There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out.",
  "I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.",
  "Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?",
  "So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",
  "Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.Look, what do you want me to do?",
  "It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was.",
  "Liam, Devon, this is Ross.",
  "I know, the babies are asleep.",
  "Don't drop by,  don't drop by!",
  "Can I ask you a cooking question?",
  "Phoebe, you have to calm down.",
  "I don’t have any issues with my Father.",
  "Oh I-I don’t know about that.",
  "It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit.",
  "So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?",
  "Someone I know is getting married!",
  "Do you think they’re having fun?",
  "I can’t take this anymore!",
  "They’re not even touching the lasagna!",
  "Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?",
  "You’ve got cotton, silk, lace!",
  "It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",
  "Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry.",
  "But I counted, you're not supposed to live here!",
  "But we probably couldn't get her anyway.",
  "Does the smoke bother you?",
  "So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?",
  "What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know?",
  "We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.",
  "And his response to each one was, \"I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.\"",
  "What is that on your finger?!",
  "What uh, what are you doing here?",
  "I think it might be raining.",
  "But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.",
  "It's nice, and, we're having fun.",
  "So well I’ll umm, I’ll have her home by midnight.",
  "Ross, don't let her drink anymore!",
  "And she feels the same way?",
  "Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.",
  "No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat.",
  "Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",
  "What, slept together a year and a half ago?",
  "I guess you weren’t there.",
  "You’re supposed to smell it.",
  "Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",
  "Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!",
  "I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.",
  "This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it.",
  "The Acting Teacher: All right, let’s start with some basics.",
  "I'm sorry, that's not funny.",
  "And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before.",
  "I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.",
  "You think this is beautiful?",
  "And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about  us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",
  "Chicken Soup for the Soul?",
  "In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.",
  "I don't know.� We could look it up.",
  "Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!",
  "If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.",
  "That’s why I made you this tape!",
  "I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",
  "What were you trying to put it in?",
  "Maybe you’re not pregnant.",
  "Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?",
  "Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",
  "I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know.",
  "I mean, I can't break up with him.",
  "And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.",
  "Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.",
  "Well... but David, just... I just want you to know  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things  I've ever had to do.",
  "Like you did with Charles?!",
  "Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around  talking about you and Ross?",
  "...Or something to that effect.",
  "Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl.",
  "Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event.",
  "So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",
  "Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",
  "But actually, she should be here by now.",
  "I know, but what are we gonna do?",
  "They don’t know that I’ve come home yet.",
  "I’m talking about the barca lounger!",
  "I told you you were a bath person!",
  "Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",
  "I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!",
  "Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.",
  "Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",
  "I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",
  "Oh, please don’t get married before I do.",
  "Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she’s the same size as me.",
  "Do you have my birth certificate?",
  "Everybody ready to go to the movies?",
  "Just a lot of close friends.",
  "Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit!",
  "Can I sleep on your couch?",
  "Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back.",
  "What are you doing tonight?",
  "It felt nice to acknowledge this.",
  "Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.",
  "Maybe I should get another pair!",
  "The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...",
  "Yeah, it was definitely an improvement.",
  "Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.",
  "You're not actually going to send these out are ya?",
  "Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules?",
  "Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.",
  "Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please?",
  "Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.",
  "Because you’re really not supposed to do that.",
  "All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year.",
  "I mean tell me that you like him.",
  "Italian guy comes homes with a date.",
  "And when that happens in a marriage...",
  "It was right after I slept with Joey.",
  "you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.",
  "Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff.",
  "Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.",
  "I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese!",
  "Chandler, we’re gonna start with…",
  "Would you please rub this on my chest?",
  "I don't know...right, he's the pig!",
  "It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!",
  "You look happy and sick; you smoked!",
  "Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt",
  "Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.",
  "I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room.",
  "Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.",
  "I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.",
  "Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!",
  "I always knew you were gonna make it.",
  "\"I’m gonna hire a lawyer and I’m gonna sue you and take all your money.",
  "Oh, God, do you think she heard?",
  "Well why didn’t you stop her?!",
  "Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand.",
  "I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine.",
  "You put this on a hamburger!",
  "Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",
  "And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!",
  "We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.",
  "She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!",
  "Can somebody please go in?",
  "A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!",
  "Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.",
  "Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?",
  "Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",
  "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
  "I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?",
  "But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you.",
  "I didn't wanna leave him alone.",
  "Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?",
  "I'm glad it's not a problem.",
  "It did that the last time.",
  "I can't believe someone ate it!",
  "Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",
  "This seat is really uncomfortable!",
  "Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced.",
  "If you don't do it, I will.",
  "Great for holding my lipstick.",
  "If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",
  "The Cooking Teacher: Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?",
  "I will loan you the money.",
  "Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",
  "What is the matter with you?!",
  "Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about!",
  "So, does that mean the audition is off?",
  "I can't take any more secrets!",
  "Hey you guys I’m gonna take off.",
  "Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her.",
  "Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.",
  "Oh, oh, it's not in there!",
  "I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!!",
  "Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",
  "Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?",
  "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.",
  "You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend.",
  "You kissed her that night too?",
  "Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",
  "Well I'm sorry but you were!",
  "I’m just sort of in the middle of something.",
  "I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!",
  "Man, so-so what are you up to?",
  "I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know?",
  "I’m totally cool with that.",
  "Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!",
  "What they’re not invited?!",
  "So does it really hurt as bad as they say?",
  "You’re the one that bailed on us.",
  "I don't know, probably just invest it.",
  "Does anyone want to come to the movies?",
  "We have apple cinnamon...Wow!",
  "Which one of us should go to dinner?",
  "And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",
  "I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!",
  "And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",
  "I am totally ready to come back to work.",
  "Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!",
  "C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!",
  "I think he's stealing from me.",
  "So just, just shut up and close your eyes .",
  "Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?",
  "Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.",
  "This is a huge  breakthrough for her!",
  "Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.",
  "What're you gonna do, suck the door open?",
  "Because the kids need new shoes.",
  "Okay, uh-uh imagine this, \"The Mr. Bowmont.\"",
  "Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",
  "Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",
  "There was like no chemistry between them.",
  "Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",
  "And I will be teaching acting for soap operas.",
  "And second, say it don't spray it.",
  "Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.",
  "And seriously, she seems very nice.",
  "I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!",
  "You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?",
  "Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his �business� partners.",
  "I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…",
  "Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh!",
  "Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",
  "Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.",
  "Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",
  "That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!",
  "Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.",
  "Oh, I’m not doing it alone.",
  "Hey, can I ask you something?",
  "No, I don't think less of you.",
  "My ass is going to get bigger  too.",
  "Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us!",
  "Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.",
  "Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!",
  "Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.",
  "I’ve been taking dancing lessons.",
  "Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win.",
  "Monica knows what she wants to say!",
  "C'mon, you'll make a day of it!",
  "And y’know we got to talking and I…",
  "That tone will not make me go any faster.",
  "Okay, what’s the big deal?",
  "That’s great news right—I mean for them.",
  "You can't kiss Ross you got the history.",
  "But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",
  "You must be a little uncomfortable.",
  "I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.",
  "Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape.",
  "And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.",
  "Get your hands out of there!",
  "The Cooking Teacher: Welcome to introduction to cooking.",
  "Get out Let's go, come on.",
  "So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work?",
  "I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",
  "Why do you care so much anyway?",
  "I still can’t believe she slept with you in the first place.",
  "I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",
  "Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K.",
  "What if he doesn’t make it?!",
  "I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook?",
  "But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks.",
  "Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.",
  "No, y'know what don’t close it ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",
  "You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend.",
  "Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.",
  "Oh, so-so you talked to her.",
  "Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",
  "Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",
  "It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.",
  "This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?",
  "Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.",
  "…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…",
  "Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?!",
  "Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?",
  "I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.",
  "Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch.",
  "Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.",
  "Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.",
  "Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.",
  "C'mon, you're going out with the guy!",
  "This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.",
  "But they're not your friends anymore.",
  "Oh, they cut me out of the show.",
  "Yes, every single one of them.",
  "Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",
  "Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.",
  "You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you.",
  "Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.",
  "So you talked to your dad, huh.",
  "No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.",
  "There isn't a decent outlet.",
  "Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel.",
  "And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.",
  "No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",
  "God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.",
  "When’s my daddy coming back?",
  "Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about.",
  "No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous.",
  "That has been broken for a while.",
  "So where are we going next?",
  "I was working late in the library one afternoon.",
  "Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",
  "I didn’t want to be that guy.",
  "Rachel, lock the door.� Lock the door,� seriously.",
  "Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",
  "How do you know the happy couple?",
  "There were two, I picked the bigger one.",
  "Everything we feel for each other.",
  "Good luck with  the career.",
  "Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair.",
  "Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...",
  "…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator.",
  "I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.",
  "Maybe that will liven up this party.",
  "I wanna say good-bye at the car!",
  "Is everything all right, dear?",
  "Pheebs, I think she’s great.",
  "Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.",
  "It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different.",
  "And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution.",
  "After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, \"This is my brother-in-law Ross.\" Not, \"My friend Ross,\" \"brother-in-law Ross.\" That’s weird isn’t it?",
  "How could this happen to me?!",
  "Where exactly is your zoo?",
  "They have racquets don't they?!",
  "My uterus is an inhospitable environment?",
  "I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",
  "Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?!",
  "There’s nothing to handle.",
  "Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",
  "I'll put a pillowcase over my head.",
  "Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.",
  "So-so, you missed a message from who?",
  "Well,  your first birthday is over, and it was really...",
  "Well, there’s gonna be strippers there.",
  "‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",
  "Joey’s Date: Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on the door.",
  "I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.",
  "Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.",
  "I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at \"who's more over who\"!",
  "Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",
  "And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first!",
  "Well, maybe you could give to somebody else.",
  "Are you wearing waterproof mascara?",
  "Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",
  "Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",
  "You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!",
  "Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",
  "It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.",
  "I've always wanted to live with a guy.",
  "Joey, do they know that we know?",
  "Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",
  "No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.",
  "We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.",
  "Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!",
  "All right, you two, stop it!",
  "Who wouldn’t be interested?",
  "Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",
  "Joey let me ask you a question.",
  "Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!",
  "Okay well that may be true.",
  "Well then, what about you?!",
  "And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",
  "Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.",
  "No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy.",
  "Don’t make any rash decisions, okay?",
  "I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.",
  "Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?",
  "Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",
  "Now, I’m just someone’s wife!",
  "She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.",
  "Don't worry, I'll be back before  you know it.",
  "Fine, I'll give the suit back.Santa?",
  "My parents have never seen me drunk!",
  "I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.",
  "Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!",
  "Pheebs, I don’t understand.",
  "Heidi, which of my boys do you like?",
  "Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.",
  "Joey, keep your head in the game.",
  "That’s right good things, that-that is what I said.",
  "Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down.",
  "I was really depressed okay?",
  "Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",
  "We uh, we never had bonus night!",
  "I just wish things didn’t have to change.",
  "So, do you want to give a check?",
  "It’s Allesandro, from Allesandro’s.",
  "And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.",
  "What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.",
  "Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.",
  "Well, I hope you’re gonna bid on some things Rachel.",
  "I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!",
  "Thanks for letting me stay here!",
  "I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.",
  "How’d the ah, basketball go?",
  "And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.",
  "Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",
  "Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!",
  "But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",
  "I’m just doing it to get back at Ross.",
  "So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.",
  "I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.",
  "Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.",
  "Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",
  "We don't, we don't wrestle now.",
  "Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",
  "Don't hit on your existing friends!",
  "All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!",
  "Does Monica know about this?",
  "Not that I even care, y'know.",
  "It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",
  "Hey, how'd the catering go?",
  "I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.",
  "It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",
  "Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?",
  "But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?",
  "Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!",
  "Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store.",
  "Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",
  "She’s upside down but she’s coming!",
  "Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",
  "Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!",
  "Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room.",
  "Are you wearing two belts?",
  "You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!!",
  "And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!",
  "I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put  my happiness first like that.",
  "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
  "Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",
  "Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away.",
  "Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",
  "December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.",
  "I don't know, I don't know.",
  "Yeah umm, they're called wallets.",
  "Well, I guess that's something.",
  "So what’s-what’s going on with you?",
  "500 bucks at a flea market?!",
  "Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!",
  "Well it stupid, unfair question!",
  "So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh?",
  "Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",
  "Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.",
  "And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",
  "Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",
  "But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.",
  "Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can.",
  "We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.",
  "Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.",
  "And I still have about five seconds to spare.",
  "All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",
  "No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles.",
  "He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself.",
  "Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference  with Charlie.",
  "It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind.",
  "Ohh, it’s gonna be so great!",
  "Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.",
  "Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps.",
  "So you know this leaves us with...",
  "Did not, she did not wink at you....",
  "He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",
  "Did you just make that up?",
  "I mean Rachel’s out with some guy.",
  "Hey, Pheebs, check it out.",
  "As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!",
  "Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",
  "Wait, did you say until the sixth?",
  "The Head Librarian: How can I help you?",
  "Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd!",
  "Ross, what are you doing?!",
  "Well, what about my stuff?",
  "But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know!",
  "Give me a little sugar here.",
  "He’s the one who slept with someone else.",
  "I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states.",
  "You're not gonna be phased out!",
  "No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",
  "All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.",
  "I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her.",
  "I’ll try to control myself.",
  "We're talking about my principles!",
  "And the scents I used don’t compliment each other.",
  "so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be.",
  "Pull out the  packing material...",
  "Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.",
  "Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.",
  "Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame.",
  "yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,  a wonderful person please don't blow her off.",
  "How we used to make out all the time after you went  to sleep.",
  "I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing.",
  "You guys gonna be living together again?",
  "Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum.",
  "Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember?",
  "Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",
  "We did a little improv there.",
  "Y’know what goes good with that?",
  "Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",
  "Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?",
  "Well, I got a job interview.",
  "Why not a Yugoslavian?\" Yeah, then you did that.",
  "It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!",
  "Please take your time, it’s an important decision.",
  "Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up.",
  "How, how is this my fault?",
  "Oh honey no, you ate it all.",
  "Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?",
  "So, I still have boxes here.",
  "I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know?",
  "Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",
  "I'm still looking through mine...",
  "We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that.",
  "He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",
  "But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good.",
  "Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.",
  "Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.",
  "We really would have been  spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…",
  "Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",
  "You being the cake and Richard being the too.",
  "Oh, yeah, with the mug painting.",
  "Come on Chappy, do your business.",
  "Well, those were seals, man.",
  "But you wanted lumps, Ross?",
  "I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!",
  "This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",
  "Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach.",
  "Y'know, she may not even know.",
  "It’s okay if it bothers you.",
  "I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers.",
  "There’s a two-year waiting list.",
  "I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.",
  "Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.",
  "Ohh, I’m so happy for you!",
  "And besides, he's a very ethical man.",
  "You  know, I'll help out more.",
  "Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of  the couch?",
  "I-I've been given the gift of time!",
  "It was her favorite book as a kid.",
