When I moved to a new state, which I knew I was going to be there for a short time, I got 2 jobs (1 in retail and the other in grocery) just to have some money come in.. And now I moved one more time and I'm going to be here for at least 3 years so I'm going back to school to learn a whole new trade in being a dental assistant..  Each job that I left(except the 2 recent ones), I always got promoted and when I was leaving they always were sad to see me go and always tried to get me to stay because I proved myself to them that I was worth keeping around.. And if I was to stay at the 2 most recent jobs, I would have been promoted as well but I turned the promotions down because I knew I'd be leaving..",
